 ΓÇ£The Golden TimeΓÇ¥!
 Starting tonight, ΓÇ£NARUTOΓÇ¥ will be airing every Wednesday, from 7:27 at night!
 ΓÇô LeaderΓÇª LeaderΓÇª ΓÇô For those who always watch ""Naruto,""
 and also for those who are watching for the first time, please enjoy!
 Now, the new opening theme song,
 ΓÇ¥HARUKA KANATA (Far Beyond)ΓÇ¥ is about to start!
 Listen here! Leader!
 W-What is it Konohamaru? I was just getting into itΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs only 7 oΓÇÖclock.
 What?
 YouΓÇÖre 27 minutes early.
 This is actually the time slot for ΓÇ£The Prince of Tennis.ΓÇ¥
 W-What?!
 W-W-What are we going to do?
 ΓÇô I already did the greeting! ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs not my problemΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt care any more!  IΓÇÖm going to start ΓÇ£NARUTOΓÇ¥!
 Hey, Sakura, Sasuke.
 Naruto went ahead and started the program.
 Are you ready?
 No, no! IΓÇÖm still in the middle of my facial!
 What about the VTR for the main show?
 It hasnΓÇÖt arrived here.
 I guess it canΓÇÖt be helped.
 IΓÇÖll have to do some dancingΓÇª
 Nah! I mean IΓÇÖm going to get the VTR.
 In the meantime, you guys will have to fill up the time.
 What?!
 IΓÇÖm depending on you. This is your mission.
 Huh, a missionΓÇª all right!
 All right, weΓÇÖll do it!
 Hey, Naruto!
 This is all your fault for being so careless! You have to learn your lesson!
 OuchhΓÇª.
 Go Go!
 Press down hard on the gas
 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 W-What? Where is this place?!
 Restricted Area Do Not Enter
 This is the site of the second exam, the 44th Training Field...
 Also known as... the Forest of Death.
 Forest of... Death?
 Huh?
 Is that supposed to be... a rock?
 Moreover, on top of the grass?
 Hey, Konohamaru! What is it that you want?!
 Just what I expect from the man I respect!
 Good job on figuring it out!
 Hey! Too much gunpowder used!
 With an adult sexiness!
 IΓÇÖm Moegi of the senior class at Kunoichi preschool!
 I love factoring! 					Udon!
 The most brilliant Ninja in the village! Konohamaru!
 The three of us together are the Konohamaru Gang!
 Here we are!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on you guys?
 Hey, IΓÇÖm about to take the second exam for the Chunin Exam.
 I have no time to be playing around with you guys!
 We didnΓÇÖt come to play around!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! We came here for an interview!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 Interview?
 Yeah, we were put in charge to write the feature article for the ΓÇ£Chunin Exam,ΓÇ¥
 for the academyΓÇÖs class newspaper.
 So thatΓÇÖs why we came to interview you, leaderΓÇª
 Please cooperate with us.
 Please.
 But...
 Hey, over there!
 What are you doing?!
 Konohamaru here is asking about an interview for the class newspaperΓÇª
 Oh, I forgot that Lord Hokage was mentioning something like that.
 Hey, heyΓÇª
 All right, take a 10-minute break starting now!
 For those who will be interviewed, resign yourselves and be courteous.
 Hey, heyΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs this all about?
 Big brother Naruto! IΓÇÖm depending on you.
 All right!
 In that case, I'll just show you how attractive I am!
 Special Report: Live from the Forest of Death!
 Chapter of Character Introduction
 Please introduce yourself.
 Okay!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
 A Ninja from Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 My hobby is to play pranks, and I love ramen noodles,
 IΓÇÖve just become a Genin butΓÇª
 My dream is big, to become a Hokage!
 And IΓÇÖm going to surpass all the Hokage from the past,
 and make everybody in the town acknowledge my existence.
 IΓÇÖve been called a failure and such, but I graduated splendidly and,
 as a member of Group Seven led by Kakashi Sensei,
 I am dealing with difficult missions every day!
 Distance from the target?
 5 meters.
 IΓÇÖm ready anytime.
 In Group Seven, there is also Sasuke and Sakura.
 Since IΓÇÖm really the only one that shows great success,
 you donΓÇÖt worry about the other two.
 I got you!
 DonΓÇÖt say such things. lntroduce them properly!
 Is the target correct?
 I know, I know.
 The target confirmed.
 For example, this guyΓÇÖs name is Sasuke Uchiha
 and heΓÇÖs a pretentious guy.
 I heard that heΓÇÖs one of the last remaining of the famous Uchiha clan,
 but he really is a pitiful guy, like thisΓÇª
 Oh, this was when I transform but...
 as long as you understand the greatness of my Ninja skills thatΓÇÖs all that matters.
 Oh, and this is Sakura Haruno who is in love with me.
 You know, the more she denies it, the more IΓÇÖm convinced itΓÇÖs true.
 She hardly tells me how she really feels about me but,
 her shyness makes her even cuter!
 Is that true?
 It really is true, true.
 WhoΓÇÖs in love with Naruto?! Cha!
 It was a lie after all!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Well, putting that aside, three of us formed a team
 and got through a bunch of dangerous missions together.
 Hey youΓÇª
 What?
 Oh, Missus!
 IΓÇÖve gotten rid of all the weeds!
 What? 					What's wrong?
 ThoseΓÇªthose arenΓÇÖt weedsΓÇª
 Huh?
 Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!
 Somebody! HelpΓÇª!
 No!
 Free Fall!
 You idiot.
 Trap Field Do Not Enter 		Don't go over there!
 Hey! 					Please stop!
 That foolΓÇª
 Geez... All because he stubbornly chose that big dog.
 This is a dangerous mission?
 It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto.
 Yikes !
 Well, there were times like that too.
 Do it over.
 Transform!
 Oh, this was when I defeated the Old Man Hokage.
 This isnΓÇÖt going to make a good article.
 Fine, then you show me how to do it.
 Fine! My name is KonohamaruΓÇª
 The grandson of the townΓÇÖs chief Hokage.
 Grandfather is the most important figure in the Leaf Village
 and is the third Hokage.
 Those who succeed the Hokage name is the top Ninja of the village.
 Especially the 4th Hokage is a great hero who protected the village
 from the demon fox!
 Hey, hey, hey wait!
 YouΓÇÖre only talking about other people!
 I was just about to start on myself!
 Besides, Bro, you talk too much about yourself!
 Of course, I am the star of the article, other people donΓÇÖt matter!
 YouΓÇÖre right, NarutoΓÇª
 Of course, youΓÇÖre going to forget about me
 when you graduate from the academy.
 But you can introduce me for a bitΓÇª
 Oh, yes, yesΓÇª
 He is the first person in the town who acknowledged me, Iruka SenseiΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs a really nice person,
 he always treats me to ramen noodles at Ichiraku.
 Am I just a nice person because I treat you to ramen noodles?
 Oh noΓÇªwellΓÇªthatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt laugh it off!
 Big brother, next up, IΓÇÖm depending on you!
 Oh, youΓÇÖre right!
 Then, I guess I could talk about SasukeΓÇÖs stories of failuresΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve already heard that one. Get more serious!
 That NarutoΓÇª!
 I bet he's just making up stuff as he pleasesΓÇª
 Humph!
 Who caresΓÇª
 This is good-looking Kakashi.
 How is the situation over there?
 This is cute Sakura.
 Naruto is somehow managing to fill up the time.
 More importantly, how is it over there?
 Are we going to make it in time?
 WeΓÇÖll be able to deliver by the end of the commercial break, I think.
 Oh and donΓÇÖt forget to tell the viewers about the present.
 Roger that.
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª Kakashi Sensei, please respond.
 I wonder what happened?
 He said that heΓÇÖd be back by the time the commercial ended.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped. Sakura, you have to continue.
 What, me?!
 Sakura do your best!
 Why are you there?!
 Well, it canΓÇÖt be helped, I guess IΓÇÖll have to do it.
 Chapter of Ninja Art
 Well, now weΓÇÖll have Sakura Haruno,
 who is my senior as a Kunoichi, teach us about Ninja Art.
 Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi, Sakura Haruno.
 Beautiful?
 What, you have any complaints?
 Oh, noΓÇª
 Transform!
 Well first, NarutoΓÇÖs Ninjutsu...
 Sexy Jutsu,
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Transform!
 - Transform! - Transform!
 - Transform! - Transform!
 Harem JutsuΓÇª
 I call it, ΓÇ£Harem JutsuΓÇ¥!
 And something like this.
 Hey!
 ItΓÇÖs his fault that heΓÇÖs late!
 Dropping the blackboard eraserΓÇª
 Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke,
 who graduated as the top student at the academy.
 You wonΓÇÖt get me by attacking straight on.
 The most popular one in class, he can also fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal.
 Sasuke is awesome!
 Your Sasuke introduction is taking too long.
 Naruto, you're so noisy.
 Stay quiet.
 Horse!
 Tiger!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 What?!
 ThatΓÇÖs not a Jutsu Genin can useΓÇª
 He couldnΓÇÖt have enough Chakra!
 Demon Wind Shuriken Windmill of Shadows.
 Shuriken wonΓÇÖt work on me.
 IΓÇÖll do it.
 C-Could that beΓÇª?
 Sharingan!
 Is that, the SharinganΓÇª?
 If this is the same Kekkei Genkai as Kakashi SenseiΓÇÖsΓÇª
 he can read Bushy-BrowΓÇÖs Jutsu!
 Genjutsu or NinjutsuΓÇª itΓÇÖs some kind of magic either way.
 IΓÇÖll reveal that!
 Although you have seen Sasuke using powerful Jutsu like
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu, Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan,
 the greatest of all is...
 the sharp look of his eyes!
 Any girl who has been stared at with those eyes,
 will fall in love with him!
 Sasuke! 					Look this way!
 YouΓÇÖre... annoying.
 Well, that cold behavior is also another attractive quality of SasukeΓÇª
 Next is our teacher, Kakashi Hatake Sensei,
 also known as the Copy Ninja Kakashi.
 He uses the Sharingan in his eye to assess the enemyΓÇÖs technique
 and copy over a thousand Jutsu techniques.
 But heΓÇÖs always late to meet people, and whenever he has any time
 he always reads this questionable book called Make-Out Paradise,
 and he always looks like he doesnΓÇÖt really care about thingsΓÇª
 Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu:
 A Thousand Years of Death!
 And the biggest mystery of all is his face hidden under that mask!
 I wonder what he really looks likeΓÇª
 Ninja Art, Summoning, Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
 If you canΓÇÖt use your eyes or ears, simply use your nose.
 ThatΓÇÖs what happens when youΓÇÖre closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
 This is the Summoning Jutsu specialized for pursuit.
 On top of all that, why does he have the Sharingan in his left eye
 that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan?
 One mystery after another when it comes to this person,
 so many things that I donΓÇÖt understandΓÇª
 I should ask him next time I have the chance.
 Lightning Blade!
 What theΓÇª?!
 His hand isΓÇª visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Water Prison Jutsu.
 Oh no!
 Secret Jutsu.
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 Next up are the Ninjutsu of the other Ninjas besides us.
 ThereΓÇÖs such a diverse collection of Ninjutsu that I have no time to explain allΓÇª
 Chapter of Rivals
 Please, Sasuke, whom I feel is like my future self,
 take care of the next part.
 Sure. After all, I have be the one to do something about it.
 I knew that from the beginning.
 DonΓÇÖt try so hard to look cool.
 Sasuke, the snob.
 DonΓÇÖt interfere.
 Stay out of it, loser.
 Annoying.
 Shut up!
 I hate the fact that only you stand out.
 Nobody strong around you shows any interest in you.
 What theΓÇª?!
 Just watch this.
 Hey!
 You thereΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs your name?
 IΓÇÖm Gaara of the desert. I have an interest in you as wellΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs your name?
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Hey, you there. ldentify yourself.
 Dang it! Again? It's always about Sasuke!
 When asking someone his name, give your own name first.
 You, with the unpleasant look.
 Wait a minute!
 Why donΓÇÖt you fight with me here now?
 I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
 The one I want to fight isnΓÇÖt youΓÇª ltΓÇÖs Uchiha.
 Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke! lt's annoying!
 ItΓÇÖs true!
 Nobody thinks that youΓÇÖre the main character leader!
 ThatΓÇÖs not true, theyΓÇÖre all just blind!
 HuhΓÇª As usual youΓÇÖre just about the talk and not the walk.
 ThatΓÇÖs not true!
 Leaf Whirlwind!
 See, you are just about the talk.
 UhhΓÇª even Sakura is picking on me.
 The students who gathered for this Chunin Exam are all skilled,
 and are the cream of the cropΓÇª
 Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi, lno Yamanaka,
 Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru, and Shino AburameΓÇª
 You wonΓÇÖt never be able to win with the way you have been fighting.
 You must understand that, right?
 Y-Yeah! Of course!
 You, too. Be careful not to let your guard down
 so you wonΓÇÖt be defeated by some lame guy!
 Huh! Of course!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 We passed the first stage of the Chunin Exam and
 are heading to the location of the second stageΓÇª
 No matter what kind of adversity may lie ahead,
 we will not be afraid!
 And we will pass the exam to become a Chunin!
 Because we... we...
 have the greatest teamwork that was formed by a strong bond!
 Okay! Let's go!
 Thank you so much for cooperating with the interview!
 ΓÇô Thank youΓÇª 					ΓÇô Leader!
 Do your best!
 Yeah leave it to me!
 ΓÇô Bye! 					ΓÇô See you!
 ΓÇô Do your best! ΓÇô Good luck!
 Oh guysΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorry IΓÇÖm late.
 A cute girl started talking to me on the way, and I danced for a bit.
 And thatΓÇÖs a lie!
 Well, donΓÇÖt say thatΓÇª
 I did bring the VTR like I said.
 You have to praise me.
 Yes, Kakashi Sensei youΓÇÖre great!
 Now we can see the rest of the show!
 Everybody look forward to it!
 Oh, before that the commercial breakΓÇª
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The 44th Training Field, also known as the Forest of Death.
 From here on itΓÇÖs a serious battle between the Ninjas,
 anything could happen!
 ItΓÇÖs going down in earnest now!
 This is getting interesting!
 A life-risking survival game in the forest!
 I will survive without fail!
 Next time: ΓÇ£The Chunin Exam Stage 2: The Forest of Death!ΓÇ¥
 As for me, IΓÇÖm going to kick butt again!

 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Withdraw! YouΓÇÖre not suited to being a Shinobi.
 You donΓÇÖt have the privilege of deciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Hinata, give it to him!
 NarutoΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt just take it! Argue back!
 IΓÇÖm getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto...
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyes has changed...
 So you're not going to withdraw?
 IΓÇÖm not taking responsibility for what happensΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt want to run away!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji! I challenge you!
 Here!
 A Failure Stands Tall!
 As I thought, this is the extent of itΓÇª
 the head familyΓÇÖs power!
 What the--?!
 But Hinata laid a perfect strike!
 N-Not yetΓÇª
 What's with this guyΓÇª!
 I-It can't beΓÇª.
 Well, nowΓÇª.
 I guess this is why he's called the most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.
 Y-You meanΓÇª All this timeΓÇª?
 That's right! I can see the Chakra Points.
 W-What is he talking about?!
 On the Chakra NetworkΓÇª
 there are 361 energy centers or Chakra opening,
 each about the size of the head of a pin.
 They're called Chakra Points.
 Theoretically, hitting one directly can halt or increase Chakra flow,
 enabling one to gain complete control over an opponent's flow of Chakra.
 Just so you know,
 not even my Sharingan can see Chakra Points!
 Having the penetrating eye is one thing,
 but to hit it so accurately like that during a match,
 well, that's justΓÇª
 Lady Hinata...
 What we have here is an unchangeable difference in abilities.
 It's what distinguishes the elite from the failure.
 It is brute, unalterable fact.
 You were destined to regret having said
 that you don't want to run anymore,  the instant you said it.
 And now, you must have abandoned yourself to despair!
 This is your ultimatumΓÇª
 Withdraw!
 I-I...
 I-I meant it...
 and amΓÇªsticking byΓÇª
 every word...
 HinataΓÇª
 I said!
 I'm not gonna run away!
 Because that'sΓÇªmy Way of Ninja!
 I had no idea... Hinata was this toughΓÇª
 She's a lot like you.
 Come to think of itΓÇª She's always watching you.
 Huh?
 HinataΓÇª
 Bring it on!
 She has reached her limit.
 One more blow andΓÇª
 Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points
 have completely halted her flow of Chakra.
 That means she can no longer send Chakra
 into her opponent's body to fight in the Gentle Fist.
 This match is as good as over.
 But I never imagined there would be someone this powerfulΓÇª
 I'm afraid even our Sasuke is no match for him.
 It looks as if Neji may very well take this Exam.
 It's going to take more than what this girl has to bring him down.
 L-Look at those eyesΓÇª
 Is he going to try to kill her? No, no, that's absurd.
 Doesn't it seem thatΓÇª
 NejiΓÇÖs strength is somehow against the rules?
 He's just too powerfulΓÇª
 I mean it!
 Go, Hinata!
 Naruto...
 Strength has come back into her eyesΓÇª
 I've been watching youΓÇª
 I've been watching you closely for many years now!
 Why I wonderΓÇª?
 Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!
 What a pain!
 It's all your fault!
 Like I care!
 Okay!
 NarutoΓÇª d-do your best.
 Transformation!
 I don't know why, butΓÇª
 I am Naruto Uzumaki!
 I'm not about to lose to the likes of any of you!
 Is that perfectly clear?!
 I'm not about to lose to the likes of any of you? Yeah, right!
 That idiot.
 He made a roomful of enemies in the space of an instant.
 When I watch Naruto...
 Naruto, stand up!
 If you compete with me for the name of HokageΓÇª
 YouΓÇª will be the loser!
 I can feel courage welling up.
 I feel that I can hang on, that I can do itΓÇª
 that I too am worth something!
 Oh!
 ΓÇô No! 					ΓÇô Hinata!
 Hinata...
 At some point, Hinata, who was in the habit of just giving up,
 made up her mind to change.
 Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.
 She put every ounce of her being into her training.
 I saw it with my own eyes.
 But even so, she continued to fail all her missions.
 She lost her nerve when faced with real competition
 and became easily discouraged.
 But today's Hinata is different.
 I have neverΓÇª
 seenΓÇªthat look in her eyes before.
 Naruto.
 I have always done the watching up to now,
 but, now, finallyΓÇª
 finally, I amΓÇª
 Naruto!
 You just don't get it, do you?
 Your strikes were ineffective from the very first.
 It's the end.
 HinataΓÇª That's enough.
 You lost the match,
 but you've become a new person in the process.
 You did well.
 I want to change that about myselfΓÇª
 So I proposed it myselfΓÇª
 Neji's final blow went straight for the heart.
 I feel sorry for her,
 but she won't be standing again now.
 As further fighting is not feasible under these conditionsΓÇª
 Don't stop it!
 Don't stop the match! Believe it!
 Naruto, stop!
 What on earth are you saying, stupid!
 She's had it. You can see she's unconsciousΓÇª
 Huh?
 Why do you stand up?
 If you continue like this, youΓÇÖll really die!
 He is now finally for the first time truly seeing me.
 I will not be caught looking bad...
 Why?!
 in front of...
 the person I admire most.
 I-I am far from finished!
 Give up the bravadoΓÇª
 I can tell you're just barely standing.
 You've shouldered the lot of having been born
 to the head family line of the HyugaΓÇª
 And cursed and blamed yourself for being weak...
 But, people cannot change.
 That's just the way it is.
 There is no need for you to suffer any more!
 Surrender to it!
 You're wrong... Brother Neji.
 Because I can tellΓÇª
 that you are suffering much more than I.
 What?!
 You are the one who is torn up
 over the fate of head and branch family.
 Neji, the match has been called!
 Oh boy!
 Neji, get a hold of yourself!
 You promised me
 you wouldn't let the head family thing get you riled up!
 Why are all the other Jonin butting in?!
 The head family gets special treatment, eh?
 Hinata?!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata! Are you okay?!
 Hey!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Yeah.
 IΓÇª
 Do you thinkΓÇª
 IΓÇªchanged maybe a little bit?
 Hey you, failure!
 I have two pieces of advice for you.
 First, if you intend to call yourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And the second...
 a failure will always be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you're coming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be done officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted genius through sheer effortΓÇª
 Wouldn't that make for an exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably going to be the one fighting NejiΓÇª
 but it would be okay with me if you ended up fighting him, Naruto.
 All right already.
 So this is okay then, right, Guy Sensei?
 Lee! YouΓÇª.
 Nice going!
 Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.
 Was he trying to kill her then?!
 The precious little time you have would be better spent
 seeing to her than glaring at me.
 Medics!
 Hurry! What's taking so long?!
 S-Sorry.
 Get her on the stretcher. One, two, three.
 It's serious. She 's got about 10 minutes at the most!
 Get her to the emergency room. Pronto!
 Out of the way!
 HinataΓÇª
 Because that's my Way of Ninja.
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever

 The Absolute Defense of the Sand?
 They say no one has ever injured Gaara.
 He's strong as heck and has no weak points.
 Bushy-Brows is no match for himΓÇª
 But wait, he's not losing!
 He seems a lot faster than before.
 Is this due to his training?
 I am getting excited about it!
 Next episode: ""Gaara vs. Rock Lee: The Power of Youth Explodes!""
 I'm just a little envious of that training.

 Just one more time, I wanted to see themΓÇª
 Just one more timeΓÇª I wanted to touch themΓÇª
 Just one more timeΓÇª To see those smiling facesΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 the moment I felt that rush in my bonesΓÇª
 that IΓÇÖd be able to see Nawaki and Dan shortlyΓÇª
 I realized that IΓÇÖm a hopeless fool!
 Just by remembering those facesΓÇª
 I become this blinded.
 Big sister!
 TsunadeΓÇª
 I loved themΓÇª I truly loved them!
 So, I wanted to see them and hug them in my arms!
 ButΓÇªI couldnΓÇÖtΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt lose the bet, no matter what!
 Because of that kidΓÇª I remembered the dreams of the two.
 Here I was trying to forgetΓÇª
 This village is grandfatherΓÇÖs treasure!
 IΓÇÖm going to protect it!
 'Cuz IΓÇÖm the grandson of the First Hokage
 who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!
 I love this village and my comradesΓÇª
 So I want to protect them.
 Right! Someday, IΓÇÖll become just like Grandfather.
 And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Unlike youΓÇª I will be the heir to the Hokage name, no matter what!
 Since my little sister died, that sole thought has sustained me.
 So IΓÇÖll become the HokageΓÇª
 An existence that protects everyoneΓÇª
 ΓÇô Becoming the Hokage is my dream! ΓÇô Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 The precious dreams that they risked their lives forΓÇª
 Making those dreams come true was also my desireΓÇª
 Things that have formed eventually decayΓÇª You said that.
 ButΓÇª
 after all, these are feelings that wonΓÇÖt decayΓÇª
 So our negotiations have broken downΓÇª lt canΓÇÖt be helped.
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, I have no choice but to ask forcibly.
 Breakdown! The Deal is Off!
 Come! Orochimaru!
 Come to think of it,
 weΓÇÖve never gone at it even once until now.
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 IΓÇÖm the one who has to go at it with her, right?
 Now IΓÇÖm going to kill you two worthless punksΓÇªhere!
 Incredible strength as usualΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be over if youΓÇÖre hit once.
 I can see thatΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a bit cramped here for fighting at a distance.
 Are you going to change the location?
 That would probably be betterΓÇª
 There was another troublesome person with the Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs attendant.
 That person may come to her aid.
 YouΓÇÖre going down!
 Who isΓÇªthe troublesome person?
 One of Sannin, the same as you and Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Jiraiya!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away, no matter what!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 HuhΓÇª Princess Tsunade tore it upΓÇª big time.
 This means that Lady Tsunade refusedΓÇª
 Where did old Tsunade go?
 That belongs to Lady TsunadeΓÇª!
 TontonΓÇª Which way?
 Okay!
 It looks like youΓÇÖre quite out of breath, tooΓÇª Tsunade.
 ItΓÇÖs just about time.
 IΓÇÖm not that great at Taijutsu, butΓÇª
 A Food Pill!
 That SignΓÇª!
 This kid can also use Medical NinjutsuΓÇª
 He got my muscleΓÇª!
 I severed, ever so slightly,
 the bicep muscle of your upper arm and the rectus muscle of your thigh.
 Now you wonΓÇÖt be able to release your incredible strength.
 A Chakra scalpel, ehΓÇª Why donΓÇÖt you target the arteries?
 Indeed, with this scalpel,
 I could cut the muscles and vessels without external injury.
 But as may be expected,
 I canΓÇÖt make a long, delicate scalpel in the middle of battle
 that can reach the arteries and the heart muscle.
 But, even soΓÇª
 thereΓÇÖd be no problem at all if I target the opponentΓÇÖs neck!
 Dang it! My intercostals got hit. My breathingΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs no ordinary Medical Ninja.
 His Jutsu sense and his edge exceed even me in my heyday!
 It would still be trouble if you were to die on me.
 I wonΓÇÖt target your vital spotΓÇª
 But with this, you canΓÇÖt move anymoreΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs amazingΓÇª
 Ordinarily, one wouldnΓÇÖt be able to budge due to difficulty breathing.
 It looks like it will be necessary to rough her up a little moreΓÇª
 but not enough to kill her.
 Even though IΓÇÖm trying to move my handΓÇª
 my leg moves?!
 D-DonΓÇÖt tell me! This isΓÇª
 You little!
 In my present condition,
 this seems to be the extent of my powerΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖsΓÇª ItΓÇÖs not the musclesΓÇª ltΓÇÖs the nerves!
 It seems youΓÇÖve realizedΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs right. ItΓÇÖs the nerves!
 I changed Chakra into electricityΓÇª
 made an electrical field and poured electricity into your nerves.
 The communication between the brain and the body
 is all done with electric signalsΓÇª
 Tsunade jumbled up all of the electric signals that are exchanged
 at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.
 Having left battle and yet such powerΓÇª
 So this is the legendary Sannin?
 Healing-types use too much ChakraΓÇª
 But in this conditionΓÇª
 If I try to move my right handΓÇª
 my left leg moves.
 If I try to move my left ankleΓÇª
 my right shoulder moves.
 ItΓÇÖs difficultΓÇª
 But IΓÇÖve already grasped eighty percent of what moves when I move what.
 DonΓÇÖt mess with meΓÇª
 with this low-levelΓÇª
 Jutsu!
 What?! In only a moment, his body movementsΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre scared of blood, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 IΓÇÖll show you plenty from now!
 JiraiyaΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs been a long timeΓÇª Jiraiya.
 OrochimaruΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve got an evil look as usual.
 Huh?!
 K-Kabuto?
 NarutoΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª So you know each other?
 We took the Chunin Exam together!
 Why are you here, KabutoΓÇª?
 Get out of the way!
 HeyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll takeΓÇª
 these guys!
 Just because youΓÇÖve mastered your body movementsΓÇª
 it doesnΓÇÖt meanΓÇª
 you can move like normal!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away now!
 Too late!
 My body movements have finally returnedΓÇª
 BloodΓÇª!
 Having two of the legendary Sannin as opponents is hairy, isnΓÇÖt itΓÇª?
 So even if it's just oneΓÇª I'll stop you!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! WhatΓÇÖs happening?!
 WhyΓÇÖs Kabuto fighting with old Tsunade?!
 YouΓÇÖre slow, NarutoΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why youΓÇÖre no match for Sasuke.
 Take a good look at the headband!
 HeΓÇÖs OrochimaruΓÇÖs subordinate.
 Wha--?!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 I was a spy from the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 YouΓÇÖre lying, right, Kabuto?
 During the Chunin Exam you taught us a lotΓÇª
 And you also saved us.
 Well, I wanted to gather data on you guys.
 Naruto, thereΓÇÖs something I understood by gathering your data.
 You have no Ninja ability.
 Unlike Sasuke!
 ItΓÇÖs the first time IΓÇÖve seen Lady Tsunade like thisΓÇª
 Please donΓÇÖt push it too far alone.
 IΓÇÖm your attendant, soΓÇª
 Old Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Even with a fierce look,
 youΓÇÖre just a cute Genin whoΓÇÖs a fish out of water.
 Admittedly, I was anticipating the monster dwelling inside youΓÇª
 But now, with the legendary Sannin before me,
 you leave something to be desired.
 YouΓÇÖre just a puny zero. So if you meddleΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll kill you.
 You little!
 DonΓÇÖt, Naruto!
 My bodyΓÇÖs stillΓÇª
 That handΓÇª
 He shouldnΓÇÖt be able to use that right hand anymore.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 IΓÇÖll attack at once with fourΓÇª
 and break him from the right side where he canΓÇÖt defend!
 You little!
 Okay!
 What?
 Blood?
 Poison Needles!
 My neural reflexes still havenΓÇÖt completely returned!
 I canΓÇÖt dodge completely!
 With the headbandΓÇª!
 Good job, acting so quicklyΓÇª
 Thanks, Shizune!
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 A Plasma Pill!
 A Plasma Pill?
 So heΓÇÖs trying to replenish lost blood, huhΓÇª
 That kid is a Medical Ninja same as meΓÇª
 The blood is gushing out nicely, eh, Kabuto?
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 Please take off the bandage on your left arm.
 That man is OrochimaruΓÇª
 At last, the real thing appearsΓÇª
 Shizune!
 Y-Yes!
 You take care ofΓÇª that guy with the glasses!
 IΓÇÖll take care of Orochimaru!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Enough already, you traitor!
 Don't you dare touch Old Lady Tsunade again!
 Hey Old Lady, just like our wager
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you!
 I won't run away! I won't give up!
 Just watch. This is my Way of Ninja!
 Next time:  ""Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!""

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,

 YouΓÇÖre not old enough

 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones

 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,

 Funeral March for the Living
 Wh-WhyΓÇª
 Why does such a good man have toΓÇªdie?!
 ItΓÇÖs sadΓÇª 					ltΓÇÖs so sad!
 I remember nowΓÇª
 I forgot when, but you showed it to me, didnΓÇÖt you?
 With a twinkle in your eye,
 you proudly said it was a memento of your father.
 That was the pipe box, wasnΓÇÖt it? lt was an amazing box.
 No wonder youΓÇÖre so proud of itΓÇª
 Even though I took it and smashed it, you only laughed.
 You were smiling when we kicked you and tossed you.
 It was a great smile.
 ReallyΓÇª
 Hold it in, Rokusuke! TheyΓÇÖll all be gone.
 If we let this moment go,
 there will be no other chance to get out of the village.
 But Kanpachi isΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs for the village,
 we have to do something and make our way to that village!
 YeahΓÇª
 Funerals are awesome, arenΓÇÖt they!
 I wanna do that again.
 OneΓÇªtwoΓÇªthree peopleΓÇª got away againΓÇª
 Looks like we can have another funeral.
 This isΓÇª
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 You areΓÇª?
 Naruto Uzumaki! Right now, IΓÇÖm in the middle of training.
 The Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 H-Hey! I said hey!
 Hang in there!
 This is training tooΓÇª!
 I canΓÇÖt give up yet! Not yet!
 The escort for the ruler of the Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,
 was completed without incident!
 Well done.
 ThatΓÇÖs Lady TsunadeΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Excellent dumplings are always from the Leaf Village, arenΓÇÖt they?
 That was my last one!
 Mission Accomplished!
 I came to pound the pirates of the Gottani Channel
 with the fist of love!
 If they take this opportunity to rehabilitate themselves,
 itΓÇÖs worth while to shed a tear!
 IΓÇÖll have your team do it for me.
 Yes?
 Even though weΓÇÖre already busy, that Naruto brought in more work.
 After this, Guy has the S-rank mission.
 The client picked him, so he must depart today.
 So, do it without Guy.
 ThatΓÇÖs pretty straightforwardΓÇª
 I called Neji Hyuga, Tenten and Lee.
 Ohh!
 My pupils can undertake the fulfillment of this mission without incident!
 WaitΓÇª
 Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.
 Why can't it just be my pupils, who are loved by all the world?
 Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!
 It just is.
 Hidden Leaf Hospital
 Those three people that Naruto saved came all the way
 from the Katabami Gold Mine to request a mission.
 Katabami Gold Mine is one of the Land of RiversΓÇÖ greatest mines,
 but about half a year ago, hooligans calling themselves the Kurosuki family
 appeared on the pretext of guarding it, and took control of the villageΓÇª
 killing villagers for no particular reason.
 How vile!
 Your mission is this:
 Once those three have regained their strength,
 escort them to Katabami Gold Mine and eliminate the Kurosuki family.
 ItΓÇÖs a simple mission.
 Well anyway, it must be a group of punks whoΓÇÖre after money.
 Why did you call me for such an easy mission?
 Who do you think you are?
 IΓÇÖm busy searching for Sasuke and training, and--!
 You forced your way into missions that you werenΓÇÖt called for.
 ItΓÇÖs not a GeninΓÇÖs place to choose his missions!
 Would you like to be sent back to the Academy? Well?!
 Neji Hyuga!
 Yes!
 YouΓÇÖre the leader!
 It will be good training for you to try to tame the unstable.
 I donΓÇÖt want toΓÇª but, IΓÇÖll do it!
 IΓÇÖll go continue my training!
 Hey Naruto!
 Please excuse them. They have no mannersΓÇª
 Wait!
 Those little bratsΓÇª!
 What the heck do they think missions are?!
 Umm, excuse me?
 What?!
 The Kurosuki FamilyΓÇª
 What did you say their bossΓÇÖ name was?
 Raiga!
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thoughtΓÇª
 What?
 Well, on a previous mission, I heard a rumor about him.
 A rumorΓÇª?
 Pervy Sage hasnΓÇÖt returnedΓÇª IΓÇÖm forced to go on a missionΓÇª
 Oh, this is irritatingΓÇª
 Sakura!
 Naruto?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on? A bird?
 Yesterday I found it injured and treated it, butΓÇª
 Sakura, thatΓÇÖs amazing!
 But poor thing.
 ItΓÇÖs separated from its friends.
 Naruto!
 Oh, sorry, did I intrude?
 You intruded big time!
 No, no!
 DonΓÇÖt turn your back, no need to grovel to youth.
 Sakura, Hello!
 Hello!
 What did you come here for?
 ΓÇô Just to have a word. ΓÇô Huh? What the--?!
 Oh, Sakura, goodbye!
 ΓÇô Hey! What was that?! ΓÇô She went wild, didn't she?
 She should act her age.
 Ichiraku 		What?! The boss of 		the Kurosuki family
 is one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist?
 Yeah, itΓÇÖs exclusive information from our respected teacher, Guy.
 WhoΓÇÖre the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist?
 Naruto, you said that
 you fought in the Land of the Waves mission, didnΓÇÖt you?
 At that timeΓÇª
 Oh, Zabuza! And?
 And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Sensei fought Kisame Hoshigaki.
 I heard that you met them there too, Naruto.
 Oh! I know that guy!
 Those two were once called
 the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 And at that time, who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?
 Oh!
 The man called Itachi! And then?
 You still donΓÇÖt understand?
 If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist,
 then heΓÇÖs probably tied to Itachi who was with Kisame.
 Oh! And?
 Tell me, who's after Itachi?
 I know! Sasuke!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 We can probably get the clue to SasukeΓÇÖs whereabouts
 at Katabami Gold Mine!
 ButΓÇª
 If thatΓÇÖs what Guy Sensei said thenΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt say anything rude!
 It's information that's 100% reliable!
 Starting now, while guarding Rokusuke and the others,
 we head toward Katabami Gold Mine
 to fulfill our mission to wipe out the Kurosuki family.
 ThereΓÇÖs a shop IΓÇÖm familiar with close to the gold mine.
 LetΓÇÖs make that the base.
 What do you mean a shop youΓÇÖre familiar with?
 ThatΓÇÖs the fun part of the trip.
 That aside, that Naruto is lateΓÇª
 If the source of the information is Guy Sensei,
 maybe he couldnΓÇÖt quite trust it?
 ThatΓÇÖs not true! Naruto will definitely come!
 ThatΓÇÖs because Guy SenseiΓÇÖs information is correct!
 Whatever.
 Here I am!
 WeΓÇÖre all here soΓÇª!
 Is that for you to say?!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 SoΓÇªwhich way?
 DonΓÇÖt be so anxious, Rokusuke,
 Those guys will save our town.
 ItΓÇÖs post-meal training!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose!
 How long do you intend to rest here?!
 If we hurry, we can save Kanpachi from the burialΓÇª
 Give it upΓÇª
 How long do you think itΓÇÖs been since that happened?
 ItΓÇÖs painful butΓÇª
 I rememberΓÇªthis sleepiness. The shop is close by.
 You say youΓÇÖre sleepy, and are you walking in your sleep?!
 ItΓÇÖs okay.
 I slept while on a marathon on this road for three days straight.
 You are joking, right?
 ItΓÇÖs true.
 The track meet of my youth with Guy Sensei.
 My body still remembers it.
 IΓÇÖve gotten sleepy.
 Hey, Bushy Brow, are you really okay?
 ThatΓÇÖs right. In this area, thereΓÇÖs the scent of spicy curry.
 Curry? Now that you mention itΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 Over there, itΓÇÖsΓÇª the Curry of Life Shop!
 Grandma Sansho!
 Oh myΓÇª 					Oh goodness!
 I havenΓÇÖt seen you for a while!
 ΓÇô Oh my my my! ΓÇô You're looking well!
 This is the shop Lee is familiar with?
 That mountain is the Katabami Gold Mine
 Grandma SanshoΓÇÖs curry saved my life.
 So youΓÇÖre saying itΓÇÖs delicious curry?
 No, it really saved my life. IΓÇÖm indebted to this curry.
 It was when IΓÇÖd just become a Genin ΓÇª
 When Guy Sensei gave me a special training routine.
 Oh my, thatΓÇÖs right. I remember.
 Do your best!
 Oh myΓÇª
 Hey Grandma Sansho!
 Oh my, theyΓÇÖve come again!
 Those people are running in their sleep.
 Karashi! Karashi!
 If you had that kind of energy, you wouldnΓÇÖt lose to the bullies.
 Oh my, I might have said too much.
 Curry of Life Shop
 Oh my! ItΓÇÖs the third day.
 TheyΓÇÖve been running the whole time.
 Oh my. What a problem.
 I wonder if heΓÇÖs hungryΓÇª?
 What a pickle! He's not waking up!
 Maybe I didn't use enough spice?
 KarashiΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve never seen a person who works this hard.
 Oh reallyΓÇª so you want to help this young man tooΓÇª?
 This is the curry of life.
 Now! Grandma Sansho went to the trouble of making this curry.
 LetΓÇÖs eat!
 IΓÇÖm digging in!
 Yum! This is yummy-yum delicious!
 Delicious! The use of spices is wonderful!
 And this rice goes perfectly with the curry!
 Delicious!
 By the way, I donΓÇÖt see Karashi.
 Karashi saw how hard you worked
 and became a bright kid full of energy, butΓÇª
 He got too much energy and left for town.
 What?
 I was wrong to keep telling him to be stronger.
 ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm going to be a man!
 ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm going to be part of the Kurosuki family,ΓÇ¥ he said.
 Oh my! IΓÇÖm not blaming you. DonΓÇÖt worry.
 It's too late.
 IΓÇÖm responsibleΓÇª
 Oh my.
 Neji!
 Please include KarashiΓÇÖs rescue into our mission!
 WeΓÇÖll bring him back from the road of evil!
 ItΓÇÖs fine.
 WeΓÇÖll use this shop as a base and take a good look into the village.
 Then weΓÇÖll come up with a strategy and spring into action.
 Yes!
 You guys await orders here.
 Because itΓÇÖs dangerous if the Kurosuki family finds us.
 ItΓÇÖs a disaster!
 Rokusuke! Rokusuke! He's gone!
 IΓÇÖm sure he went to town alone!
 ThatΓÇÖs not good!
 If those guys find RokusukeΓÇª!
 Now that itΓÇÖs come to this,
 we donΓÇÖt have time to come up with a strategy!
 LetΓÇÖs get right to it!
 No!
 WeΓÇÖll get right to it!
 Let's hurry.
 Wait for me, Kanpachi, IΓÇÖm coming nowΓÇª
 SomeoneΓÇª is comingΓÇª
 Aw, againΓÇª I have to put on a funeral!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 You taught me that day.
 If you cook with great care,
 you can save someoneΓÇÖs life with just one serving of curry.
 Even for a person like me,
 with intense effort, itΓÇÖs not an impossibilityΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thought.
 You were far more admirable back then, Karashi.
 ButΓÇª

 think about the fastest way to get to the destination.

 IΓÇÖm sorry this happens all the time, but class is over for today.

 Konohamaru?
 Konohamaru!
 What do you think youΓÇÖre doing with Grandpa's things?!
 Honorable grandsonΓÇª
 Those belong to my Grandpa!
 Where are you taking them?!
 UhΓÇªyou mean these?
 They are no longer used,
 so I thought IΓÇÖd put them into storage in a different location.
 No longer used, you sayΓÇª
 You think itΓÇÖs okay to take GrandpaΓÇÖs things away without permission?!
 The Fifth Hokage will be using the chambers, you know.
 The Fifth Hokage?
 Y-Yes.
 The next Hokage has finally been decided.
 The village can have peace of mind now.
 That person apparently doesnΓÇÖt smoke tobaccoΓÇª
 What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!
 ItΓÇÖs too soon for that!

 Wh-What are you doing?!

 DonΓÇÖt call me that!

 Be careful, little boy.

 IΓÇÖm the person who has to deal with the complaintsΓÇª
 Okay, okay.
 IΓÇÖm not a little boy!
 Who the heck are you?!
 ThatΓÇÖs my questionΓÇª
 Naruto!
 Konohamaru?
 Long time no see!
 Hey, more importantly, have you seen a big-boobed, scary old ladyΓÇª
 I mean, young lady?
 I did see her!
 ΓÇô Where did she go?! ΓÇô Who the heck is she?!
 Who is she?
 She has to go to the hospital straightaway!
 Hospital?
 That lady may not look it,
 but sheΓÇÖs an awesome Medical Corps Ninja!
 She finally came back to the village to become the Hokage, soΓÇª
 what is she taking her sweet time for?!
 HokageΓÇª
 The Fifth Hokage.
 She better do what she promised to do.
 YouΓÇÖre lyingΓÇª
 Huh?
 I donΓÇÖt believe you!
 ItΓÇÖs a lie!
 What?
 There are seven birds within 50 meters behind me in the direction of the ΓÇ£2.ΓÇ¥
 TentenΓÇª?
 Neji!
 I just heard that that Lady Tsunade has returned!
 ItΓÇÖs the real McCoy. Wanna go see her?
 Sorry.
 But IΓÇÖm not interested.
 Huh?
 So there wereΓÇª
 eight birds, huhΓÇª
 Listen carefully, Tsunade.
 We must call the feudal lords
 and announce the fact that the Fifth Hokage has been chosen.
 We will start preparations today for the inauguration ceremony in the village.
 Feudal lords and ceremonies are just a big pain.
 Tsunade!
 Yes, yes, I knowΓÇª This is also the job of the Hokage.
 ΓÇô Genma! 					ΓÇô Here!
 ΓÇô Aoba! 					ΓÇô Here!
 Issue an official notice and
 convey this matter to those in the village within the next few days.
 We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.
 ΓÇô Yes, ma'am! 					ΓÇô Yes, ma'am!
 I hate you, Grandpa!
 Why did you have to die?
 The Fifth HokageΓÇª
 Gimme a break, my shoulders are so stiff.
 I wish I could just down a nice cup of hot sake and relax.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Wait a second!
 Before you do that,
 you have something else you need to do, Old Lady Tsunade!
 What was it?
 I told you, didnΓÇÖt I?!
 About Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke and Bushy Brow!
 OhΓÇªright, right.
 Hey, if it isnΓÇÖt Naruto!
 Huh? Shikamaru?
 Why are you in a place like this?
 ThatΓÇÖs my questionΓÇô
 Why are you in a place like this?
 I have no idea why,
 but my father told me to come along with him.
 WhatΓÇÖs up with that?
 Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.
 Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.
 Are you taking proper care of the deer?
 The antlers of the deer from that area make very good medicine.
 Yes, IΓÇÖm somehow managing.
 Hey, Naruto, whoΓÇÖs that person
 who acts like such a big shot when she's so young?
 ThatΓÇÖs apparently the new Hokage.
 Huh?!
 Despite her appearance, sheΓÇÖs an old lady in her fifties.
 Yikes!
 Well, see you again sometime.
 Yes, maΓÇÖam.
 All right, to the hospital!
 See you later, Shikamaru.
 IΓÇÖm will show you an awesome new technique I learned!
 ThatΓÇÖs the new Fifth HokageΓÇª?
 Hey, Shikamaru.
 That person is the strongest and most beautiful person in the world.
 Huh?
 I mean, sheΓÇÖs the lone female amongst the Legendary Sannin.
 HuhΓÇª A female Hokage?
 IΓÇÖm not very comfortable with womenΓÇª
 Huh?
 Even though they're unusually frank, they always hang around and
 you're never quite sure whose side they're on.
 They always think they can make men do whatever they want.
 Anyway, theyΓÇÖre just a pain.
 Hey ShikamaruΓÇª
 Without women, men wouldnΓÇÖt be born.
 If women werenΓÇÖt around, nothing good would come of men.
 No matter how hard-edged a woman might be,
 sheΓÇÖll show her gentle side to the man she loves.
 I canΓÇÖt believe that PaΓÇÖs saying thatΓÇª
 when he's tied to MomΓÇÖs apron strings.
 YouΓÇÖll understand once you reach that age.
 Oh no!
 LetΓÇÖs hurry up and get our business doneΓÇª
 because Mom will chew us out if weΓÇÖre late.
 Hurry up, Shikamaru!
 Looks like nothing will come of some men
 even if they have a woman.
 Konoha Hospital
 IΓÇÖm coming in.
 Who are youΓÇª?
 What a beautiful womanΓÇª
 Sakura, Sakura!
 Everything will be all right now!
 I brought along an awesome person.
 Sasuke will be fine now!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Those two flowers arenΓÇÖt from the same day.
 So this kid is coming here every day, huhΓÇª
 I heard from Guy SenseiΓÇª
 Please save Sasuke.
 OK, leave it to me.
 Sasuke!
 SasukeΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke, youΓÇª!
 Hmm, despite his appearance, that Naruto is pretty considerate.
 Huh?
 Next! Next!
 How disgraceful!
 To be taken down by just two insurgents.
 And here I thought you were a genius.
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 All right! Kakashi SenseiΓÇÖs done!
 Next, Bushy Brow!
 Please hurry up and take a look at my disciple Lee!
 Lee!
 I brought Lady Tsunade here!
 ThatΓÇÖs your disciple?
 Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!
 I seeΓÇª
 Naruto.
 Huh?
 Is it really okay for you to be idling away your time here like this?
 Uh, I almost forgot!
 I had an appointment to meet Iruka Sensei!
 Go on!
 OK! IΓÇÖll leave the rest in your hands!
 All right!
 Hey, Naruto!
 YouΓÇÖre late, Iruka Sensei!
 Sorry, sorry.
 There were lots of things to do with respect to the Fifth Hokage.
 I guessΓÇª
 Thanks for waiting!
 IΓÇÖm digging in!
 Naruto.
 HuhΓÇª?
 You have really developed compared to the time when you wanted this.
 I have, havenΓÇÖt I?
 You think so too, right?
 This headband that I received from Iruka Sensei
 suits me perfectly, donΓÇÖt you think?
 Stop being so cocky!
 You still have a long, long way to go!
 You have lots of work to do!
 Listen carefully, Naruto!
 The Leaf Village is in a very difficult situation right now.
 Starting with the Third Hokage, we lost many fine Shinobi.
 The current strength of the Leaf is less than half what it normally is.
 Despite that, we must continue to carry out our missions.
 Why is that?
 If you donΓÇÖt have enough manpower, you should turn it down.
 No, that wonΓÇÖt doΓÇª
 If we turn down our missions,
 it would be like announcing to other countries our weakened state.
 Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailing will probably be assigned to missions.
 I seeΓÇªthese are difficult times.
 Hey! This concerns you too!
 You need to play an active role and carry out your duties
 in order to aid Lady Tsunade.
 Yeah.
 But, before I do that, I need to satisfy my stomach.
 ThatΓÇÖs just like you.
 Do your best!
 Seconds!
 Hey, hey! How'd you finish so fast?!
 I'll be straight with you.
 Give up being a Shinobi.
 L-Lady TsunadeΓÇª donΓÇÖt joke like that.
 There are numerous bone fragments in the area around important nerves.
 Moreover, they are deeply embedded.
 YouΓÇÖre not physically capable of carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.
 Come now, Lady Tsunade, donΓÇÖt joke like thatΓÇª
 Even if I were to operateΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt be fooled, Lee!
 That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!
 You changed yourself using the Transformation Jutsu,
 you evil woman!
 Who the heck are you?!
 DonΓÇÖt I have anyΓÇªchance?
 There is no one besides me who is capable of doing the surgery
 and it would take too much time.
 Furthermore, there is a huge riskΓÇª
 Risk?
 The probability of a successful surgery is 50% at best,
 and if it failsΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖll die.
 Guy Sensei!
 IΓÇÖm not at all ready to throw in the towel!
 Guy Sensei, whatΓÇÖs this god-awful bitter rice dumpling?
 They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.
 If you eat one hundred of them, they should heal your wound.
 I see, if I donΓÇÖt eat one hundred of them,
 my wound wonΓÇÖt heal, right?
 N-Not in a single day!
 ItΓÇÖs better that you give up being a Shinobi and look for a different path.
 LeeΓÇª
 LeeΓÇª
 If I knew this was going to happen, I shouldnΓÇÖt have brought you to him.
 DonΓÇÖt say thatΓÇª!
 I am painfully aware of how you feel, but itΓÇÖs better to be clear.
 Because itΓÇÖs something heΓÇÖll have to understand sooner or later.
 The longer we waitΓÇª
 the harder it will be for him.
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Konohamaru, just come out from there already!
 Shut up!
 Listen, I'll treat you to a bowl of ramen!
 Don't want any!
 OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.
 You're such a pest!
 What did you just say?!
 In that case, I'll pull you out by force!
 Be ready for that!
 Next time:  ""The Will of Fire Still Burns!""
 Don't miss it!

181,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Byakugan!
 Why did you take down Naruto with her?!
 It was an accidentΓÇª
 Had I not applied the finishing blow to her at the moment,
 we wouldΓÇÖve been in danger instead.
 I know of no instance
 of the Ninja Art: Kujaku being defeated up until nowΓÇª
 He will be missed.
 Hidden Leaf Shinobi, your mission is over.
 I still havenΓÇÖt taken back the star.
 WeΓÇÖll search for it by ourselves. Thank you for your help.
 Hoshikage: The Buried Truth
 Rest easyΓÇª IΓÇÖm not an enemy.
 Come to think of itΓÇª What happened after I fell off the cliff?
 Could it beΓÇª? Did you save me, lady?
 YesΓÇª
 I see. I donΓÇÖt really remember, thoughΓÇª
 Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks.
 IΓÇÖm Naruto, a Ninja from the Village Hidden in the Leaves andΓÇª
 Umm, I came to protect the star, butΓÇª
 You kind of stole it, ladyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm NatsuhiΓÇª
 Natsuhi? What? IΓÇÖve heard that name beforeΓÇª
 Oh!
 That red starΓÇÖs sure pretty.
 NatsuhiboshiΓÇª lt watches over me all the time.
 ItΓÇÖs the same name as Natsuhiboshi.
 If I remember right,
 Sumaru said itΓÇÖs a star that protects him!
 Sumaru said that?
 Yeah! Say, ladyΓÇª Do you know him?
 Sumaru is my child.
 What?! So, youΓÇÖre SumaruΓÇÖs mom?!
 What?! Sumaru escaped?!
 I am very sorry.
 I was careless thinking the muscle relaxants were still in effect.
 Most likely the guys from the Hidden Leaf
 are the ones who took him awayΓÇª
 What do we do?
 ItΓÇÖd be bad news if these circumstances were to be known
 by the Leaf, no, by those in our village.
 WeΓÇÖve got to look high and low for Sumaru right away.
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to get rattledΓÇª
 We can take care of them at our leisure after we find the star.
 I got it. If we tell the Village Hidden in the Leaves something like
 they died during the missionΓÇª
 We could also convince Sumaru.
 I burned NatsuhiΓÇÖs Chakra into my memoryΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll reach the star
 if we follow the remnants of her Chakra.
 Naruto wasΓÇª?
 Yeah. Along with the Kunoichi who stole the star.
 But I didnΓÇÖt see them in the Valley of DeathΓÇª
 Are you saying they escaped from the valley
 where the poison gas swirls?
 Perhaps.
 If thatΓÇÖs the case,
 they might have crossed the border and escaped safely to the forestΓÇª
 Hey, letΓÇÖs all look for them!
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal, guys?!
 Naruto helped all of you, didnΓÇÖt he?!
 But if we donΓÇÖt have an order from Lord AkahoshiΓÇª Right?
 YeahΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt have time to be waiting for an order! IΓÇÖm going!
 IΓÇÖm goingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll go too, if itΓÇÖs to look for Naruto.
 Mizura, you canΓÇÖt.
 I want to be useful in some way.
 NoΓÇª IΓÇÖll go.
 Sumaru?!
 YouΓÇÖre okay!
 We safely rescued him from the HoshikageΓÇÖs medical room
 where he was being held!
 What? Why was he in Lord HoshikageΓÇÖs medical room?
 It wasnΓÇÖt a Ninja from some other village
 who knocked you all out and took Sumaru away!
 Akahoshi, the leader of your village was the culprit!
 In other words, the Shinobi who made off with the star
 and the Shinobi who attacked all of you were different people.
 ThatΓÇÖs what Neji deduced word for word.
 Why would Lord AkahoshiΓÇª?
 Why would he do that to us?
 What does this mean, Sumaru?
 I donΓÇÖt know, either!
 But it seems Lord Akahoshi is hiding something from usΓÇª
 IsnΓÇÖt it about time you guys realized it?
 AkahoshiΓÇÖs using you as he pleases.
 Mizura is not the exception.
 If you guys continue training this way,
 everyone will collapse and thenΓÇª
 No wayΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be. ThatΓÇÖs a lie!
 Lord Akahoshi is not that kind of person, ever!
 Perhaps the Shinobi who stole the star will tell the truth.
 LetΓÇÖs find the Shinobi who disappeared, whatever the cost!
 The forest in the Land of Bears is deep.
 If only outsiders go, theyΓÇÖd just get lost.
 Okay, work with us.
 So leave this to me.
 ButΓÇª
 You rest now.
 At some point, the time will come when weΓÇÖll need your help.
 How about it, AkahoshiΓÇª?
 Were you able to get a lead on the remnants of NatsuhiΓÇÖs Chakra?
 This is good.
 I guess this is whatΓÇÖs called good old home-cooking.
 ThereΓÇÖs more.
 One more bowl!
 But whyΓÇÖd you do something like steal the star, SumaruΓÇÖs mom?
 This is not the first and only time I took that away.
 Ten years ago as wellΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª?
 Training utilizing that star was painful for many Shinobi at the time
 and even caused many deaths.
 My husband Hotarubi and I who survived the trainingΓÇª
 thought to seal the star to prevent any more victims due to the training.
 A Tracking Unit immediately caught up with us after we had stolen the star.
 Hold it!
 Lord Third HoshikageΓÇª
 HotarubiΓÇªNatsuhiΓÇª Your thoughts are reasonableΓÇª
 As it happens, I was also wavering.
 But in the position of Hoshikage, it was difficult to make a decision.
 I promise to terminate the star training.
 But the hard-line faction of the Star Village
 might at some point resume the trainingΓÇª
 You two must leave this village!
 I want you to keep an eye on the village from the outside.
 And if it seems that the training will begin once againΓÇª
 Please stop it with your power.
 Lord HoshikageΓÇª
 For SumaruΓÇª
 Tell Sumaru thatΓÇªwe died. Please be good to him.
 Yes, I understand.
 Upon allowing us to leave the village,
 the Lord Third Hoshikage completely prohibited the star training.
 Like us, the Third Hoshikage was also distressed
 at the damage from the star training.
 Neji was also talking about that.
 But are the effects from the star that severe?!
 Yes. My husband Hotarubi died due to side effects
 a while after leaving the villageΓÇª
 I might also die at any time from the effects.
 No wayΓÇª
 Then letΓÇÖs go back to the village!
 Tell Akahoshi directly to stop the training!
 Akahoshi is a man who puts the prosperity of the village
 ahead of the lives of the children.
 As proof of that, he has taken Sumaru hostage
 and has demanded that I return the star.
 What?! Then the masked Ninja from that time wasΓÇª
 Hold it!
 Farewell!
 Wh-What?!
 It was Akahoshi?!
 What is it, SumaruΓÇÖs mom?
 TheyΓÇÖveΓÇª 					Akahoshi has come.
 Is this the place?
 WhereΓÇÖs the star being hidden?
 HotarubiΓÇª Please protect the star, protect SumaruΓÇª
 The star is under that rockΓÇª
 But it seems the entrance is sealedΓÇª
 What can we do with a boulder like thisΓÇª?
 Our only choice is to blow it up little by little with Letter Bombs.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do that!
 Wha--?!
 DidnΓÇÖt this brat die in the Valley of Death?
 I wonΓÇÖt be done in just like that, believe it!
 You guys step back.
 Then I just have to do it again.
 Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast!
 Here we go!
 YouΓÇÖre mine!
 I saw that move coming! Become a sacrifice for my beast!
 What?!
 NatsuhiΓÇª So you were alive too, after all, huh?
 Akahoshi, reconsider one more timeΓÇª
 If you stop the star training and release the children,
 IΓÇÖll have no more to do with the villageΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt think so!
 The Third Hoshikage was stubborn
 and never wavered in his opposition.
 Opposition to those of us who trained Star Ninja
 and attempted to bring prosperity to the villageΓÇª
 No! As long as I, the Third Hoshikage, am alive,
 the resumption of that training will never be allowed!
 Return to your postsΓÇª That is all.
 Have you lost your mindΓÇª
 Akahoshi?
 YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs lost his mind!
 Rest easy and go to the other worldΓÇª
 Our generation will raise this village
 to rival that of the Five Great Hidden VillagesΓÇª
 Was thisΓÇªreally okay?
 It was necessary for the sake of the village, right?
 Exactly! We can do star training as we please.
 Unforgivable!
 What do you think of all those who are training frantically,
 believing in you guys?!
 OneΓÇÖs even on the verge of dying! Do you understand that?!
 Sacrifice is unavoidable for the sake of village prosperity.
 A Shinobi is merely a tool for that.
 For the sake of village prosperity?
 Knock it off!
 All youΓÇÖre doing is deceiving the people in the village!
 This is a Star Village issueΓÇª I will settle this.
 B-ButΓÇª!
 Step back!
 Yotaka, Shisou!
 Wha--?! He devoured his comradesΓÇÖ Chakra!
 My Chakra beast has a full stomach.
 Things wonΓÇÖt go as they did before.
 Talk is cheap!

 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.

 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?

 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Neji, howΓÇÖs SumaruΓÇÖs mom doing?
 SheΓÇÖs stable for now,
 but her condition can worsen at any moment.
 What?
 Her Chakra Network that had already been weakened
 due to the side-effects of the star before she received AkahoshiΓÇÖs attack.
 In other words, her Chakra Network is all beat up?
 Hey, Granny Tsunade could heal her, right?
 I donΓÇÖt know.
 But either way,
 if she were to use the Ninja Art: Kujaku any further,
 thereΓÇÖs no guarantee sheΓÇÖll live.

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away

 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left

 ItΓÇÖs not that IΓÇÖm holding a grudgeΓÇª
 But on account of you, I had kind of a tough time of it.
 I seeΓÇª
 ButΓÇªwhy youΓÇª?
 I owe a lotΓÇª
 to the Leaf.

 I heard that weΓÇÖd made up with the Sand traitorsΓÇª
 But to think youΓÇÖd change this abruptlyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not like we attacked the Leaf for the fun of itΓÇª
 It was an orderΓÇª
 In the same way that IΓÇÖm here now.
 I see. The Fifth Hokage asked the SandΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a big help.
 By the wayΓÇª has your sharpness gotten worse?
 Huh?
 Are you going to give up again or something?
 This time, IΓÇÖll do it for you!
 Sorry, but I canΓÇÖt give up.

 Right!
 Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

 WhatΓÇÖs this guy?
 I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!
 WhereΓÇÖs the other one?
 Hey! Who are you looking for?
 That stateΓÇª I know!
 Be careful! They enter the body and start to fuse!
 ItΓÇÖs too late.
 This guy!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Sakon?!
 It seems likeΓÇª
 your Jutsu didnΓÇÖt workΓÇª on the puppet.
 This is a puppet, too?!
 Let me tell you this.
 We, the Sand Ninja, arenΓÇÖt as lax as the Leaf.
 Moreover, donΓÇÖt be carelessly approachingΓÇª
 the Black Ant!
 He was fearsome when he was an enemy...
 But to think heΓÇÖd be this dependable when becoming an ally.
 OwΓÇª I got careless. Let me rest in your body for a bit.
 Good-for-nothing guyΓÇª
 Who are these guys?
 This is their ability!
 Although you were caught off guardΓÇª
 you getting hammered by that puppet playΓÇª
 WellΓÇª
 Its power and speed are nothing special.
 I wonΓÇÖt be beaten by the likes of such a toy.
 And I was able to heal my belly wound.
 I donΓÇÖt have much Chakra leftΓÇª but well,
 these are opponents I should be able to tear apart, nevertheless.
 Indeed, it seems heΓÇÖs healed. What a recovery ability heΓÇÖs got.
 Ordinarily, IΓÇÖm not the one who becomes the main body,
 so itΓÇÖs hard to move, damn it.
 You sure are mocking usΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs not an opponent you can beat fighting head on!
 We should retreat for now andΓÇª
 We canΓÇÖt back down after having been mocked, you know.
 DonΓÇÖt mess with me!
 The Black Ant isnΓÇÖt a Mechanism for attacking.
 Primarily, itΓÇÖs just for capturing.
 AndΓÇªCrow paired up with the Black Ant is exclusively for attacking.
 Hey you! Let me out!
 Eat this!
 Puppet ShowΓÇª
 Hey, let me out! Let me out!
 Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
 The play is over.
 She hid, huhΓÇª?
 Or did she run away?
 NoΓÇªThat couldnΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 I just got here.
 Briefly explain the present situation
 including an analysis of her ability and battle style.
 First off, her fundamental tactic is ensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu
 with the sound of her flute.
 And then she delivers physical attacks to that opening.
 Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
 This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?
 I canΓÇÖt move my bodyΓÇª!
 I believe this was your last hand, right?
 UnfortunatelyΓÇª this is reversed checkmate!
 You little rat!
 SheΓÇÖs a classic Genjutsu-style distance range type.
 Most likely, she mustΓÇÖve seen your Jutsu and figured out immediately
 that it wouldnΓÇÖt mix well with her own Jutsu.
 And itΓÇÖs two against one, too.
 SheΓÇÖll never appear before us again until she casts her Genjutsu.
 Sound, huhΓÇª?
 YeahΓÇª
 Genjutsu generally appeal to the five senses of peopleΓÇª
 sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
 The type that uses hearing is the most troublesome of them all.
 After she cleverly takes a distance on you and then hidesΓÇª
 you have no idea where the Genjutsu will be cast from or when.
 The idea is for us to already be cast by the Genjutsu
 by the time weΓÇÖve figured out where she is by the sound of the fluteΓÇª
 OuchΓÇª
 In my opinion, weΓÇÖre at an overwhelming disadvantage.
 A battle with this type, essentially, wouldnΓÇÖt even be worth talking about
 without sensor types like Kiba or Neji.
 At this rate, weΓÇÖll get pushed into a corner sooner or later.
 ΓÇô We should just retreatΓÇª ΓÇô Who asked for your opinion?!
 I told you to just explain the situation.
 DonΓÇÖt misjudge my powerΓÇª
 If she thinks sheΓÇÖs hiding well from meΓÇª
 in a distance enough for the sound of her flute to reachΓÇª
 sheΓÇÖs na├»ve!
 Summoning: Blade Dance
 Cut!
 All rightΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve made it this far. ltΓÇÖs about time for my GenjutsuΓÇª
 Huh?
 How about it?
 ItΓÇÖs done.
 SheΓÇÖs sureΓÇªpushy.
 SheΓÇÖs scarier than my mom.
 Pretty good, huh?
 But wellΓÇª
 I just have to be grateful for this timeΓÇªhuh?
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I got careless earlier, but it wonΓÇÖt be like that now!
 Now, you please stand back.
 IΓÇÖm grateful for the help, but his opponent will be me!
 Next, for sure, with my ultimate LotusΓÇª!
 Hey, why are you moving forward? IΓÇÖm his opponent!

105,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with  you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Okay! Drink! Sing!
 Let's have fun!
 Good griefΓÇªThis is too much forΓÇª a pre-celebration.
 Did you take care of the business?
 YesΓÇª
 More importantly, the rainΓÇÖs starting to let up.
 ShouldnΓÇÖt you quickly put an end to this farce of a race?
 Fine.
 Guess IΓÇÖll go for a run!
 A-Above here, huh?
 YeahΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a quite a long staircase, believe it.
 TheyΓÇÖre also called the Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart.
 Heh, cool!
 LetΓÇÖs go at a sprint!
 Hey, heΓÇÖs kidding, right?
 What kind of stamina does he have?
 Boss.
 It seems Idate is heading this way!
 He hasnΓÇÖt run away, just like you said, Boss.
 Of courseΓÇª
 I saw potential in him.
 Now, itΓÇÖs just a little more! Run Idate!
 A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder
 HeyΓÇªyouΓÇª!
 Huh?
 Let me tell youΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not like I trust you or anything yet, okay?
 Yeah, yeah whatever.
 It doesnΓÇÖt really matter to me, believe it.
 ThereΓÇÖs a person who still trusts you, right?!
 During the Chunin ExamΓÇª
 Huh?
 You said that a tenth problem appeared, right?
 Yeah. It was a weird problem to determine whether youΓÇÖd take the problem or not.
 Three years agoΓÇª
 I got a similar problemΓÇª
 Okay, now IΓÇÖm going to give the tenth problem.
 The tenth problemΓÇª
 What kind of problem is Big Brother going to give?!
 The tenth problem is a battle
 with the Three-Man Squad you were teamed up with.
 The three of you will compete against each other this exercise.
 And among youΓÇª one of you will be failed!
 And the one who is failed will remain a Genin for life
 and we will never again let them take the Chunin Exam!
 N-No wayΓÇª
 Then for what purpose were we together until now?
 I make the rules here.
 Back-talk is not allowed at all!
 If you want to withdraw, you should do so.
 Withdrawing here and waiting half a year is also a way.
 If one person among the three withdraws,
 of course all three members will be disqualified.
 But you will be allowed to take the Chunin Exam
 one more time, in half a year.
 So, what will you do?
 One comrade will be dropped.
 I have the confidence to pass.
 But, one of them will remain a Genin for life.
 ItΓÇÖs a choice between comrades and your life.
 If youΓÇÖre going to quit, nowΓÇÖs the time.
 Is there nobody else whoΓÇÖs going to withdraw?
 WeΓÇÖre good, then.
 Okay, to everyone who has remained hereΓÇª
 I render you disqualified!
 Wh-WhyΓÇª?
 H-Hold on a minute!
 I prepared myself and remained here!
 Such preparedness is below contempt!
 Scums like you donΓÇÖt have the qualifications to become Chunin!
 ThatΓÇÖs all!
 I seeΓÇª
 What kind of a test was it for you guys?
 I forgotΓÇª
 I mean, it was explained to me, but I didnΓÇÖt really get it.
 Trusting in my big brotherΓÇÖs words, I remained in the classroom.
 And yet I was failed!
 No way could I take that. I questioned my big brother.
 Big Brother! WhatΓÇÖs up with that test?!
 A Shinobi reads the double bluff.
 You shouldΓÇÖve understood that was the test.
 Even so, I canΓÇÖt accept that!
 No matter how dangerous,
 isnΓÇÖt it necessary to have the courage to plunge into any mission?!
 Idate.
 Can you really not accept it?
 Of course not, such aΓÇª
 YouΓÇªquit as a Ninja.
 If youΓÇÖre telling me to quit, then I will.
 But tell me why IΓÇÖm no good!
 ThatΓÇÖs something you should realize yourself,
 with your own power.
 To this dayΓÇªI donΓÇÖt understand the answer to that.
 So after that, you were deceived by Aoi, huh?
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖs right.
 We made itΓÇªto the top!
 IΓÇÖm going by myself from here. You rest!
 Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?!
 I canΓÇÖt be asking you guys to help any more.
 ThereΓÇÖs no point if I donΓÇÖt win by myself, on my own strength!
 OhΓÇªhey! Idate!
 I can make it! It seems SakuraΓÇÖs special medicine has worked!
 Blast!
 This doesnΓÇÖt hurt!
 IΓÇÖm back in the gameΓÇª from here!
 If we cross this suspension bridge, itΓÇÖs Ouzu Island, huh?
 We should hurry.
 It seems Idate has made it to the Modoroki Shrine.
 What?!
 It seems we underestimated the Leaf Genin a bitΓÇª
 You jerk! You didnΓÇÖt finish them?!
 NowΓÇÖs not the time to be talking about stuff like that.
 Please cross the bridge quickly!
 Useless Ninja!
 Hey! IΓÇÖm only helping you because itΓÇÖs the job.
 IΓÇÖll waste you if you keep talking smart to me.
 I-IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖve understood, then get a move on!
 Y-Yes!
 There he is! That Fukusuke jerk!
 This is quite something.
 I never thought youΓÇÖd make it this far.
 ThatΓÇÖs theΓÇª Blade of the Thunder God!
 Stop!
 Stop!
 Stop kicking a dead horse.
 Nobody is a match for the legendary Blade of the Thunder God,
 said to have been used by the Second Hokage.
 You should know this well.
 After all, youΓÇÖre the man who stole this for me.
 BlastΓÇª
 Mud balls, huh? ltΓÇÖs just like a kidΓÇÖs fight.
 Sorry, I didnΓÇÖt have any Kunai Knives.
 NarutoΓÇª
 But you wonΓÇÖt be able to dodge the next ball just with that.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 HeΓÇÖs concentrating the Chakra in his palm.
 Here I come!
 Here I come!
 Once more!
 I donΓÇÖt know what you intend to do, butΓÇª
 Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
 Too bad.
 This Blade of the Thunder God cuts through anything!
 Even Chakra itself is no exception.
 Naruto!
 I have to make doubly sure
 so that nothing troublesome will happen again.
 IΓÇÖm your opponent! Keep your hands off Idate!
 Humph, are you still saying such things?
 Saving each other, protecting each other, trusting each other.
 It ticks me off!
 The weak can't survive if they donΓÇÖt support each other.
 So they trust people easily and are betrayed.
 Weaklings like you guys should just run about and away.
 Right, Idate?
 It was like that also when you stole
 this Blade of the Thunder God, right?
 I can see it. ThatΓÇÖs the Village Hidden in the Rain.
 Aoi Sensei?!
 Aoi Sensei!
 IdateΓÇª
 B-Big BrotherΓÇª
 You idiot!
 Go back to the village immediately and surrender yourself!
 You?!
 Do you know what you have done?
 What?!
 Strict as always, eh? And heΓÇÖs your cute little brother.
 But itΓÇÖs truly perfect that youΓÇÖve shown up here.
 Aoi SenseiΓÇª
 This forbidden Jutsu scroll canΓÇÖt be deciphered
 unless youΓÇÖre Jonin class.
 IΓÇÖll have the brothers betray the Leaf Village together.
 Ibiki, please decipher it already.
 I refuse.
 So are you choosing death, together with Idate?
 Such as he is, heΓÇÖs also a Shinobi.
 HeΓÇÖs not afraid of death.
 It doesnΓÇÖt seem so.
 This face is one taut with fear.
 IΓÇÖm quitting as a Ninja! So please donΓÇÖt kill me!
 Please decipher it.
 You donΓÇÖt want to see your cute little brother killed
 before your eyes, do you?
 Little brother, you say?
 That fool?
 Big BrotherΓÇª
 Such a threat means nothing to me.
 Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hidden in the Leaves that important?
 Even if you protect it at the risk of your own life,
 youΓÇÖre nothing but a pawn!
 So thatΓÇÖs why you became a traitor?
 YouΓÇÖre a pathetic man!
 You punk!
 Idate!
 You, run away!
 What about you, Big Brother?
 IΓÇÖll go, after I clean up the mess here!
 I donΓÇÖt think so!
 Big Brother!
 Go, quickly!
 But Big BrotherΓÇª!
 Go! Having you stay is a burden!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you!
 Go!
 So appallingΓÇª
 that heΓÇÖd risk his life for such an idiotic guy.
 All you could do after that was run.
 You couldΓÇÖve returned to the village and called for help.
 But you didnΓÇÖt do that.
 Thinking Ibiki was dead was no excuse!
 The fact is, he was aliveΓÇª
 In that regard, lbiki was admirable.
 Not only did he completely endure repeated interrogation,
 but he also retrieved the Forbidden Jutsu scroll...
 without having confessed to anything!
 And to think that he did all this
 for his good-for-nothing little brother.
 You betrayed your village, abandoned your older brother,
 and came to think of only yourself.
 Even Ibiki who is blood-related and risked his life to save you,
 you didnΓÇÖt trust him!
 Afraid of being accused,
 you didnΓÇÖt trust the Village Hidden in the Leaves, your birthplaceΓÇª
 You trust nobody.
 YouΓÇÖre not trusted by anyone.
 For me, there is no pupil as excellent as you.
 As a reward, IΓÇÖll let you die in one instant.
 Idate!
 SasukeΓÇªSakura!
 Rest, Naruto!
 IΓÇÖll beat this guy!
 DonΓÇÖt be acting cool, believe it.
 You canΓÇÖt beat me, no matter how many people show up.
 Me, Aoi Rokusho,
 the Rain Jonin who possesses the Blade of the Thunder God.
 Is that so?
 Interesting.
 The Blade of the Thunder God and my Chidori!
 LetΓÇÖs test which is better!
 The rumors were true.
 The survivor of the villageΓÇÖs honorable Uchiha ClanΓÇª
 is just a good-for-nothing kidΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 Run, Sakura!
 HeΓÇÖll show no mercy, no matter who the person is.
 Everyone will be killed!
 No way!
 Huh?!
 WeΓÇÖll protect you, no matter what.
 We promised that, didnΓÇÖt we?!
 Trust us!
 Now all thatΓÇÖs left is the wounded rabbit
 and the excellent pupil, huh?
 You two together, go to the next world.
 Take it back!
 Take it back!
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?
 What you saidΓÇª
 earlier!
 Don't messΓÇª
 with the UchihaΓÇª 276	02:10:08:14	02:10:10:02 with me!
 Why you--!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke! Get up!
 How very cold the bottom of the ocean must be.
 Stop!
 Idate!
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 What the heck should we do?
 That sword of the Second Hokage won't budge an inch
 even with Sasuke's Chidori or my Rasengan!
 But I can't lose this battle.
 I won't run away, no matter what!
 If my techniques aren't going to work, I'll just have to keep trying!

198,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Like I said, I've already told you everything I know.
 You first met Genno at IchirakuΓÇª
 What did you talk about then?
 I donΓÇÖt remember everything!
 ThatΓÇÖs what we want to know.
 If we analyze your conversation,
 we might be able to figure out who hired Genno.
 We already know all the conversations
 that you've had during the past two weeks.
 What we want to know is what you guys talked about before that.
 You tell me that butΓÇª I donΓÇÖt rememberΓÇª
 Then weΓÇÖll put you under Regressive Hypnosis.
 Huh? Regressive Hypnosis?
 Using hypnosis,
 we can bring out the memory of the past from your subconsciousΓÇª
 OhΓÇª
 Just relaxΓÇª
 Back to the Past Jutsu!
 LetΓÇÖs startΓÇª
 Right now you are traveling through your memoriesΓÇª
 A day agoΓÇª two days agoΓÇª three days agoΓÇª
 Keep going back into the past.
 AndΓÇªitΓÇÖs the day you met the old carpenter.
 Where are you?
 InsideΓÇªthe forestΓÇª
 The Anbu Gives Up?                                  Naruto's Recollection 		I was training on my ownΓÇª 		And it was lunch time soΓÇª
 I headed for IchirakuΓÇª
 And thatΓÇÖs whereΓÇª
 You met him not inside the restaurant, but outside, yes?
 Hey, what are you doing?
 Huh? Oh yesΓÇª
 I was just trying to figure out if I should go into the restaurant or not.
 Is it any good?
 Old man, youΓÇÖre not from here are you?
 OhΓÇª IΓÇÖm a freelance carpenter. How did you know?
 Because all the Leaf Village people know that IchirakuΓÇÖs ramen is the best!
 I seeΓÇª
 Here you go! Thanks for waiting!
 Yes! This is quite good!
 IsnΓÇÖt it?!
 Thank you for this meal!
 YouΓÇÖre already done?
 I am a growing boy!
 Even an extra large isnΓÇÖt enough for me!
 I seeΓÇª Then, why donΓÇÖt I give you some of mine.
 What? Are you sure?
 Yes.
 Lucky!
 ThanksΓÇªold man!
 SoΓÇªwe said good-bye after we finished eating the ramenΓÇª
 And when did you meet him next?
 I met him in front of Ichiraku againΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing here eitherΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 I seeΓÇª
 It seems like there were odor neutralizing components
 in last nightΓÇÖs smoke screen.
 He was quite prepared
 Then why did he get caught?
 Well, thatΓÇÖs because our Anbu Black Ops are really good, rightΓÇª?
 He should have known
 that our Anbu Black Ops were excellent before he infiltrated usΓÇª
 He should have had other escape routes ready.
 Now that you mention it, that sounds about rightΓÇª
 But right now, thereΓÇÖs no way to find out.
 Dead men tell no tales, I see.
 Over here.
 What are you doing?
 WeΓÇÖre connecting the pieces of the corpse.
 Connecting the piecesΓÇª
 It was in a really awful shape.
 From what I hear, he had Paper Bombs all over his bodyΓÇª
 Would you like to wait outside until weΓÇÖre done?
 I-I suppose soΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll stay here!
 What?
 YouΓÇÖre quite impressiveΓÇª
 Sakura.
 And he gave me eggs and barbeque pork that timeΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs talking about Ramen again.
 Shh!
 Oh, I remember that timeΓÇª!
 What happened?
 He showedΓÇªme a photograph.
 A photograph?
 A photograph of a guy that looked about my age.
 When I asked him why he was so nice to meΓÇª
 I have a grandson.
 HeΓÇÖs about the same age as you.
 So I canΓÇÖt think of you as a stranger.
 I look forward to treasure hunting with my grandson on my days off.
 Treasure hunting?
 YeahΓÇª
 What, youΓÇÖre already done eating?!
 Then IΓÇÖll give you some of mine.
 Thanks, old man!
 What happened to your hand?
 OhΓÇª ItΓÇÖs a scar from a long time ago
 when I accidentally cut myself with a saw.
 Oh.
 And then he gave me his ramen againΓÇª
 Genno has no relativesΓÇª
 Then his story about his grandson a lie?
 We started marking him the next day.
 I think any more inquiries are pointless.
 I guess he wouldnΓÇÖt be careless enough
 to leak any information even to a Gennin.
 An emergency report from Lady Tsunade!
 I seeΓÇª There was nothing unusual about any of the buildings.
 They were all built according to their plansΓÇª
 There were no signs of any traps.
 So was it just camouflage for him to sneak in as a carpenter?
 ItΓÇÖs too soon to make a judgment on that.
 If he was just supposed to steal the plans,
 there was no need for him to be a carpenter.
 By the way, what were you guys looking up?
 We got a list of places where he used to stop by
 from his carpenter buddies,
 and weΓÇÖre looking through all those places,
 but so far we havenΓÇÖt found any clues.
 Oh, thereΓÇÖre a lot of restaurantsΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª Seems like he never went out besides to go eat.
 In the meantime, Hinata, you go see Ino and Sakura
 at the forensics center.
 Neji and Choji, you guys go help Kiba and Shino!
 Understood.
 Then, we should get going tooΓÇª
 Shikamaru!
 Lady Tsunade is calling for you!
 The Fifth Hokage is?
 What?! The Village Hidden in the Waterfalls?
 It seems that theyΓÇÖve committed all their troops into battle position.
 TheyΓÇÖre calling it a big practice run, howeverΓÇª
 Big practice runΓÇª?
 I donΓÇÖt think I need to say more, butΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs been used many times in the past. They get all of their troops together
 for the purpose of a big practice run and then invade another countryΓÇª
 Furthermore, there is information that Genno stayed in
 the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
 before coming to the Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 It wouldnΓÇÖt be unusual if there was some sort of connection.
 Most of the Ninja we've deployed
 have already been mobilized to the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
 Crossing the border will be taken as a sign of willful invasion.
 We will attack anyone that enters.
 Shikamaru, I want you to head over to the border, too!
 I donΓÇÖt think that thereΓÇÖs a need for us to go.
 Shikamaru?!
 What do you meanΓÇª?
 Naruto. 					Hey, Naruto!
 Huh?
 YouΓÇÖre getting in the way of my business by standing there!
 OhΓÇª Sorry.
 Now that I think about it,
 IΓÇÖve never seen the old man finish his ramenΓÇª
 Could it be that he hated ramen?
 But then why did he come to lchiraku all the time?
 Tell us why.
 Ten Gennin and one ChuninΓÇª
 Our presence or absence wonΓÇÖt make much of a difference
 to the overall situation.
 What is your pointΓÇª?
 I donΓÇÖt like itΓÇª
 Old Man GennoΓÇÖs actionsΓÇª
 After the investigation, IΓÇÖve figured it outΓÇª
 His everyday activities were quite impressiveΓÇª
 His abilities as a carpenter was average,
 he was quite plain, never stood out, and never made any big mistakes
 Nobody hated him, and nobody liked him.
 Even if he were to disappear all of a sudden,
 no one would think twice about it the next dayΓÇª
 A very low-key profile.
 ItΓÇÖs an undercover technique that's so impressive
 that IΓÇÖd want to put it in a Shinobi textbooks.
 A brilliant Shinobi like him being marked by the Anbu Black Ops so easilyΓÇª
 Don't you think that's a bit strangeΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 And when he was trying to get awayΓÇª
 He was able to get away from the Anbu Black Ops,
 but they caught up to him.
 For a trap professional, it seems like such a lame end.
 On top of all that, the plans have completely disappeared.
 It doesnΓÇÖt make any sense to me.
 AndΓÇª?
 Everything is moving along according to his plan.
 It couldnΓÇÖt beΓÇª?
 His true identity being discovered,
 and dying in front of the Anbu Black OpsΓÇª
 What if all of that was his plan?
 And if he had predicted that we would all leave the village
 in taking precautions against the Village Hidden in the WaterfallsΓÇª
 We could be just dancing on the palm of his hand.
 But if we look at all the information we have at this point,
 we need to be on alert for the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
 ThatΓÇÖs true, butΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt think the situation will change much
 just by sending another ten Gennin and one ChuninΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll have the Shikamaru squad continue to investigate Genno.
 Understood.
 Shikamaru! Choji!
 SorryΓÇª I didnΓÇÖt mean to make you wait.
 My head hurtsΓÇª
 Hey. Why do we have to look through these books?
 I donΓÇÖt want to do it either. But this is the basis of investigation.
 But stillΓÇª ThereΓÇÖre so many numbers, my eyes are hurting.
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª I still canΓÇÖt find it .
 I seeΓÇª
 What?
 The old recommendation letter that enabled them
 to figure out that GennoΓÇÖs recommendation letter was a fake.
 Why do you have to look for that?
 Just a hunchΓÇª
 Did the people of this house just lose it? Or did heΓÇª
 In either case,
 he should have wanted to get rid of
 the recommendation letter that he broughtΓÇª
 Why would he just get rid of the old recommendation letter?
 This is where he took his own lifeΓÇª?
 It seems that theyΓÇÖve already collected the remains.
 ItΓÇÖs a job done by the Anbu Black OpsΓÇª
 They donΓÇÖt leave anything behind.
 Everyone, come over here!
 Look, the tree is burned on both sides!
 The Paper Bombs explodedΓÇª
 There should be burned marks.
 The fact that itΓÇÖs on both sides is the problem!
 I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,
 it wouldnΓÇÖt have left marks on both sides.
 There would have to be at least two explosions
 to leave this kind of burn marks.
 But according to the Anbu Black Ops,
 he exploded the Paper Bombs that were wrapped around his body.
 But no one saw him at the moment of the explosionΓÇª
 There may be Anbu Black Ops,
 but theyΓÇÖd still need to dodge the explosion.
 This oneΓÇÖs burned on both sides tooΓÇª
 Same on this tree too.
 ProbablyΓÇª
 First, the Paper Bombs that were placed on
 the trees in the surrounding area were blown upΓÇª
 Then there was a huge explosion in the center.
 If he had set off the explosions close to each other,
 then itΓÇÖs possible to perceive it as one explosion!
 I seeΓÇª
 But in order to do that,
 he would have needed to set up some sort of trick before hand.
 Didn't Genno take his life
 after being cornered by the Anbu Black Ops?
 What if they didn't catch up to him,
 but rather, he let them catch up to him?
 So youΓÇÖre saying that he was running away
 planning to let them catch up to him here?!
 ItΓÇÖs not impossibleΓÇª
 If that is the caseΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs possible that he could have laid other traps
 Could it be thatΓÇª
 the fact he killed himself with the Paper Bombs is alsoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs done. They said you could come in.
 Y-Yeah.
 ItΓÇÖs impossible.
 DidnΓÇÖt the Anbu Black Ops make sure with their own eyesΓÇª?
 Yeah.
 There's no point in telling me to check out the body.
 IΓÇÖm not a Medical Ninja.
 What should I check and how should I do itΓÇª?
 SakuraΓÇª
 This manΓÇª He snuck in as a carpenter right?
 ThatΓÇÖs right. Is there something that bothers you?
 His handΓÇª ItΓÇÖs too clean.
 My family owns a flower shop, remember?
 IΓÇÖve been helping out since I was a kidΓÇª
 So if I look at a personΓÇÖs hand, I can tell what kind of job they doΓÇª
 CarpenterΓÇÖs hands are much more rough.
 And thereΓÇÖs no way that a trap professionalΓÇÖs hand would be so clean!
 ThenΓÇª!
 May I?
 Byakugan!
 Just as I suspectedΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no evidence that he's trained his Chakra Network.
 This man has never controlled a ChakraΓÇª
 What?
 The people from the medical group were talking over there.
 That they have some questions about this bodyΓÇª
 This person is not a Ninja!
 Reporting! The spearhead of the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
 is about to reach the borders!
 TheyΓÇÖre fastΓÇª What about our enforcement army?
 They are gathering currently,
 but theyΓÇÖre not in position for battle quite yetΓÇª
 What if they attack even before weΓÇÖre in position for battle?
 In any caseΓÇª Who would have thought
 that the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls wouldΓÇª
 Nothing will come of that right now.
 Once the enemy crosses that river,
 we will see that as their intent to wage war on us,
 and we will start to attack!
 Yes!
 Academy?
 There were no plans for the AcademyΓÇª
 Excuse me! Could you help me?
 Did you call?
 We saw that the Academy had made some payments last monthΓÇª
 Last month?
 Oh this. We did some reparation work for the Academy.
 We don't have the plans for that.
 No, thatΓÇÖs not possibleΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs strangeΓÇª Where did I put it?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 AboveΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Naruto?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 They should show themselves soonΓÇª

 that was closing in on the borders has started to retreat!

 Then where are the stolen plans?!

 This is ShikamaruΓÇÖsΓÇª
 These are the plans?
 YeahΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs written in a complex code so that itΓÇÖs not easily deciphered.
 ButΓÇª
 Why are the plans that were stolen by Genno appearing here?
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardustΓÇÖs are rapidly dancing
 I just canΓÇÖt come out and say, ΓÇ£Ah, I donΓÇÖt want to go home yet.ΓÇ¥
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs from that coke I just drank?
 Students these days, sure lack civility.
 They usually do things like eat potato chips, eat barbequeΓÇª
 ΓÇô Read comics. ΓÇô And eat box lunches.
 ΓÇô Is eating all you talk about? ΓÇô All that loafing?
 Well, I mean the self study hours are forΓÇª
 ΓÇô You know? ΓÇô No, I donΓÇÖt know.
 They devote themselves to training even though their Sensei is not watching.
 ΓÇô IsnΓÇÖt it beautiful? ΓÇô Really?
 I am moved! I will back up their training myself!
 Huh?!

 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Battle at Sea:                      The Power Unleashed!!

 Take this!
 What?!
 Crap!
 This is bad!
 Naruto!
 IΓÇÿm counting on youΓÇª
 Naruto! Hang in there.
 Naruto!
 I-IΓÇÖm okayΓÇª
 IsaribiΓÇª Thank you.
 Oh no!
 IΓÇÖll take the rest of your Chakra!

 The nerve of you to mess with me!
 Stop it, get away!
 DonΓÇÖt turn your back to the enemyΓÇª!
 You forgot the ironclad rule of the fightΓÇª
 You lose!
 You saved meΓÇª
 That brat hit me with all his strengthΓÇª
 And that Yoroi is no good either.
 I caught a huge fish!
 You mean youΓÇÖre going to escape alone?
 We completed accommodating all the injured soldiers.
 Good work!
 WhatΓÇÖs left isΓÇª
 Naruto and others, right?
 Of your numerous crimesΓÇª
 When we return to the village justice will be served,
 and it wonΓÇÖt be quick, so prepare yourself.
 ItΓÇÖs not over yetΓÇª
 You! I havenΓÇÖt hit you enough yet!
 ThatΓÇÖs too bad.
 What?!
 WhatΓÇªWhatΓÇÖs going on?
 The Sea Monster doesnΓÇÖt die. lt is immortal, that one!
 For the Sea Monster, this limitless seawater is its lifeΓÇª
 In the end, it will be your loss!
 Shut up!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 All right! IΓÇÖm counting on you, Chief.
 Go clobber that flabby guy!
 Hey, Chief! We donΓÇÖt have time for you to be so leisurely!
 That monsterΓÇª Whack him in one goΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs hot! Hot, hot!
 You got no business getting so motivated all by yourself!
 It itches, itches and IΓÇÖm getting a rash all over my body!
 Wait, wait. DonΓÇÖt come over here, Naruto!
 Damn himΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going to rip you apart when the mission is over!
 Remember that!
 Naruto! How are you going to settle this?!
 How can you say that, Chief Toad is the strongest frog!
 Please donΓÇÖt let something like the saltwater bother you and fight.
 Humph! You canΓÇÖt even control the summoned animal you called up!
 What was that?!
 If you donΓÇÖt send him home quickly
 the Sea Monster will gulp him down and heΓÇÖll whither like a slug!
 A slug, he says?!
 Hey, Naruto! IΓÇÖm going to kick your butt laterΓÇª
 Right now, IΓÇÖll help you.
 Huh? F-For real?!
 DonΓÇÖt mess with amphibiansΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll show you my terror!
 Yeah! Now you're talking.
 Hang on!
 Wh-What theΓÇª?
 You ratΓÇª Let go of me, huh!
 What is this? He got you, Chief Toad!
 You be quiet!
 Upsy!
 This isnΓÇÖt accomplishing anythingΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs up with that flabby bastard, really?
 In short, this is some kind of monster
 consisting of water gathered around its spiritual body at the core.
 Crap!
 I donΓÇÖt really know what that means,
 but I guess I canΓÇÖt do anything about that thing.
 Even though we pierce the monster with a dagger all we want,
 the monster will suck up ocean water and come back to lifeΓÇª
 Then what should we do, Chief Toad?!
 The only thing we can do here is
 to somehow damage the spiritual body at the ΓÇ£core.ΓÇ¥
 DamageΓÇª? How?
 The opponent is a clump of waterΓÇª
 Add heat and heΓÇÖll evaporate!
 The thoughts of fools mean nothingΓÇª
 The only thing you can do is to surrender to me, I who control the ocean!
 Damn. YouΓÇÖre annoying. LetΓÇÖs go, Naruto!
 What? Go? Where are you going?!
 Airhead! IΓÇÖll spew oil!
 Huh?
 Light a fire with a Fire Style Jutsu!
 What?! I canΓÇÖt do a Fire Style Jutsu!
 Here we go!
 What? Fire, fire, fire!
 HowΓÇÖs that?!
 What?!
 H-He did itΓÇª !
 Well done!
 NarutoΓÇª
 ImΓÇª Impossible!
 We did it, Chief Toad!
 HowΓÇÖs that!
 Chief Toad and me is the strongest combination, after all!
 Naruto! YouΓÇÖre in a festive mood all by yourself,
 though IΓÇÖm wondering if youΓÇÖve forgotten about something?
 Huh? Forgotten what?
 You called me to a place like thisΓÇª
 Look, now IΓÇÖve got all of these goose bumps!
 YouΓÇÖve always had all those wartsΓÇª
 Shut up! IΓÇÖll have you settle this properly!
 What?! Wha--? W-Wait Chief Toad! Wait!
 No use talking!
 It itches. I canΓÇÖt take it!
 Something like this doesnΓÇÖt soothe my feelings but,
 my sons have caused you inconvenience, so I forgive you this time.
 See you!
 IΓÇÖm sorry, Chief ToadΓÇª Help meΓÇª
 Now that we also got rid of the Sea Monster, AmachiΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖll be taken to the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as the principle offender of the attacks on ships collecting funds.
 Shame! We had got kicked around because of you!
 What are you doing?! lsaribi, kill these guys!
 I wonΓÇÖt!
 Have you forgotten?
 I am the only person who can turn you back into a human!
 If I continue doing this,
 IΓÇÖll be a monster all the way to my heart!
 ThatΓÇÖs right, Isaribi!
 YouΓÇÖre neither a human being nor fully integrated like me.
 The best you can do is to live the rest of your life as a monster
 for your whole life!
 Well, from the very start,
 I hadnΓÇÖt thought of a way to turn you back into a human!
 Like I told youΓÇª
 I was intending to dissect you!
 No wayΓÇª
 You!
 How rotten are you?!
 Stop it.
 Once weΓÇÖve returned to the village, heΓÇÖll be punished harshly.
 WellΓÇª ItΓÇÖs about time you told us.
 WhereΓÇªdid Orochimaru go?
 You think I know something like that?!
 You were tossed aside by Orochimaru.
 It serves you right to follow after him forever.
 You and I are different!
 IΓÇÖll be in charge of the research center
 and some day, will become an entity thatΓÇÖd bring Orochimaru to shame.
 ReallyΓÇª
 Just for yourself. Not fair!
 And now, mission completed. LetΓÇÖs return to the island!
 Not fair. IΓÇÖm also slug a good one before that.
 Stop it!
 ThatΓÇÖs the Jiro Island Amachi was talking aboutΓÇª
 Here is the source of my nightmareΓÇª
 This place is where the fragments of my missing memories is left.
 Master OrochimaruΓÇª What in the world did youΓÇª?
 SheΓÇÖs aliveΓÇª!
 SheΓÇÖs a lucky girlΓÇª
 After we tested ten, only one survivedΓÇª
 I guess this experiment yielded little something before I take my leave.
 LeaveΓÇª?
 Because it looks like thereΓÇÖs no reason to be here anymoreΓÇª
 But, the research is stillΓÇª
 That facility, do with it whatever you want.
 I have no need for it anymoreΓÇª
 ΓÇô WhyΓÇª? How could you do this? ΓÇô WhyΓÇª? How could you do this?
 ΓÇô I always respected you, yet youΓÇª ΓÇô I always respected you, yet youΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre lacking many things.
 Motivation to desire the ΓÇ£powerΓÇ¥ΓÇª
 TenacityΓÇª
 HatredΓÇª
 Everything!
 But, letΓÇÖs seeΓÇª
 I suppose just the fact that you survived
 might mean you have some valueΓÇª
 Say? Do you want to come with meΓÇª?
 I seeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll find a better-gifted child thenΓÇª
 It connectedΓÇª
 So brightΓÇª

 Whaddya mean?!
 What, you object?!
 UmΓÇª
 ReallyΓÇª Can I come with you?
 DonΓÇÖt worry!
 ThereΓÇÖs a very scary,
 but awesome Medical Ninja in Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Yes, because Lady Tsunade is a medical specialist.
 ThatΓÇÖs right, Lady Tsunade is amazing!
 Surely sheΓÇÖll do something for you!
 Relax and let us take care of it.
 Thank you.
 Hey, all of you!
 What are you doing?! The boat will leave!
 When did youΓÇª!
 What were you doing?!
 WeΓÇÖve been waiting for you this whole time, Sensei.
 Sorry, sorryΓÇª
 Wait! WeΓÇÖre getting on!
 Okay! WeΓÇÖre going home to the Leaf Village!
 No doubt, you are hyper from the start to the finishΓÇª
 Do you know what being tired is?
 Any problem?
 IΓÇÖm praising you! I appreciate it!
 Huh? Really? YouΓÇÖre embarrassing me.
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.

 It probably will not end

 But the doctor said he couldnΓÇÖt have it.
 So letΓÇÖs eat it together.
 Choji? Is he that sick?
 No, no, donΓÇÖt be fooled.
 He got sick from eating too much BBQ.
 ThatΓÇÖs just like him!
 Yeah well, and neither of you are the type to have female visitors.
 So hereΓÇª
 Looks good.
 W-What is it?
 Since Choji canΓÇÖt have any, letΓÇÖs eat in front of him.
 What a drag this guy is!
 Huh?
 No oneΓÇÖs here.
 Out to lunch?
 Oh wellΓÇª
 Okay!
 Hmm?
 Lee, IΓÇÖm putting the flowers here, okay?
 IΓÇÖm still hungry!
 Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?
 Oh yeah.
 WhyΓÇªsave him?
 HeΓÇÖs an important subordinate whom I care for.
 My bodyΓÇªisnΓÇÖt moving.
 You jerk!
 What the hell do you think youΓÇÖre doing?!
 Hey NarutoΓÇª
 During Shadow Possession Jutsu, itΓÇÖs moving me too! Okay?!
 Sorry! Shikamaru.
 What the hell were you trying to do?
 Choji, are you better?
 Oh, Ino!
 All right! The age of the chubby has arrived!
 What were you trying to do to Bushy Brow here?!
 I was trying to kill him.
 What?!
 How can he be so calm?
 Especially when he is not able to move with my Shadow Possession JutsuΓÇª
 WhyΓÇÖd you have to do something like that?
 You beat him in the match, right?
 Do you have a personal grudge against him or something?
 I don't have anything like that.
 I just wanted to kill him, thatΓÇÖs it.
 How can you say something so selfish, you bastard?!
 YouΓÇªyou had a lousy upbringing, didnΓÇÖt you?
 All you care about is yourself.
 Or thereΓÇÖs something weird about him. lt gives me the chills!
 If he tries anything, itΓÇÖll be too much of a burden for me and NarutoΓÇª
 What the heck should we do?
 If you get in my way, IΓÇÖll kill you both too.
 What?! Go ahead, if you can!
 Hey Naruto, hold on!
 Should I try to scare him with a bluff?
 I know youΓÇÖre strong from seeing you in the competition with himΓÇª
 ButΓÇªwe can keep up with you.
 We didnΓÇÖt show you our best skills in the preliminaries.
 And itΓÇÖs two against one!
 YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs at a disadvantage.
 If youΓÇÖre smart, youΓÇÖll do what I tell you and just get lost.
 IΓÇÖll say it againΓÇª if you get in my wayΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll kill you.
 Where the heck do you get offΓÇª?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way in hell IΓÇÖll let you do that!
 IΓÇÖve been telling you to back off, havenΓÇÖt I?
 This guy has the strength of a monster. You get it, donΓÇÖt you?
 I have a real monster in me! IΓÇÖm not going to lose to this guy!
 Huh?
 I heard Naruto was here too, so I came to see, butΓÇª
 What a messΓÇª
 Well, I guess this means heΓÇÖs okay.
 Huh?
 WhatΓÇÖs worth making him mad, you idiot!
 A monster, huhΓÇª?
 Me too, actually.
 ItΓÇÖs just like you said. I had a terrible upbringing.
 When I came into this world,
 I took the life of the woman some might call my mother.
 So that I could become the strongest ShinobiΓÇª
 my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
 and so I became possessed by a Sand Spirit.
 I was born a monster.
 A Sand Spirit?
 It's called Shukaku, the living wraith of an old monk
 from Village Hidden in the Sand who was sealed inside the tea caldron.
 It must be a type of cacodemon possession Jutsu,
 performed to a baby before it is born.
 To go that farΓÇª they must have been totally nuts.
 Is it possibleΓÇªthat there could be something inside him too?
 What a thing for a parent to be doing! Such a twisted kind of love.
 Love?
 DonΓÇÖt measure me by your standards.
 Family, huhΓÇª
 Let me tell you what kind of ties I have to my family.
 TheyΓÇÖre ties of hatred, ties of murderous intentΓÇª
 My familyΓÇÖs just lumps of flesh.
 Nourished with the life of my mother,
 I was crafted as the ultimate masterpiece of the villageΓÇª
 The KazekageΓÇÖs child.
 I was taught by my father the innermost secrets of the ShinobiΓÇª
 spoiled, over-protected, and left on my own.
 And I thought that was loveΓÇª
 Until that incident happened.
 That incidentΓÇª?!
 What are you talking about?
 Just what happened?!
 In the six years since the time when I was 6 years oldΓÇª
 My real father has tried to assassinate me more times than I can count!
 But I thought you just said that your father spoiled youΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs going on here?
 Those who are too strong are apt to become feared.
 Born through the Jutsu, my mind was unstableΓÇª
 I guess the idiots in my village
 finally realized that I had emotional problemsΓÇª
 For my father, Kazekage,
 at the same time I was the ultimate weapon for the village,
 I was also a dangerous, fearsome presence.
 It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure as soon as I turned six.
 And I was treated politely simply because I was feared.
 To them, now IΓÇÖm just a relic of the past that they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 When I asked myself that, I couldnΓÇÖt find the answer.
 But, as long as youΓÇÖre alive, you need a reasonΓÇª
 If you donΓÇÖt have one, itΓÇÖs just the same as being dead.
 WhatΓÇÖs this guy saying?
 IΓÇªcan understand thatΓÇª
 HeΓÇªis the same as me.
 So this is the answer I came toΓÇª
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowing when I might be murdered,
 finally I became calm.
 By killing assassins, I finally comprehended the reason why I liveΓÇª
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myselfΓÇª
 And if I see that all other people in this world exist
 only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.
 And as long as there are others to kill
 who can make me feel this happiness to be alive,
 I will never disappear.
 W-WhatΓÇÖs this freak talking aboutΓÇª?
 HeΓÇÖs real gone!
 I was also aloneΓÇª
 And suffered ΓÇÿcause I didnΓÇÖt know why I was aliveΓÇª
 But Iruka Sensei recognized me for who I wasΓÇª
 and that was the first time I realized why I livedΓÇª
 But this guyΓÇª this guy grew up alone.
 And he ony feels alive when he kills other people.
 H-How can there be someone like this?
 The worlds we live in are too differentΓÇª!
 ThereΓÇÖs no wayΓÇª that I can beat a guy like this!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs wrong, Naruto?
 What? Shadow Possession Jutsu should have stopped him from moving, butΓÇª
 Naruto!
 Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!
 What a drag this guy is!
 Naruto!
 Now, let me feel itΓÇª!
 Oh no!
 Stop right there!
 TomorrowΓÇÖs the final round!
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to rush like this!
 Or do you just want to stay here starting today?
 DonΓÇÖt leave me alone!
 IΓÇÖm not bleeding, but it hurts a lot right here.
 WhatΓÇªam I?!
 I willΓÇªkill you all without a fail.

 TodorokiΓÇª I said, calm down! IΓÇÖm telling you, IΓÇÖm watching!
 No, nobodyΓÇÖs watchingΓÇª
 Todoroki!
 As long as you keep your mouth shutΓÇª
 NoΓÇª Better yet, if you werenΓÇÖt aroundΓÇª
 Wait a second!
 What the heck are you thinking? Calm down!
 I'm extremely calm.
 You too mustΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 If things come to this, I guess I have no choice but to fight!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 Why donΓÇÖt you just come right out and fight?!
 You guys, too! Why donΓÇÖt you stop hiding? Come out and show yourselves!
 Huh?
 Y-You guys areΓÇª
 Stop bullying Gantetsu!
 Give Gantetsu back!
 What is this?
 I have no ideaΓÇª Who the heck are they?
 Everybody!
 W-Wait a minuteΓÇª
 How are you connected to GantetsuΓÇª?
 Stop that!
 LetΓÇÖs get out of here!
 Calm down.
 We should be able to understand each other
 if we just try to talk things over.
 You guys arenΓÇÖt Shinobi, are you?!
 ItΓÇÖs dangerous for amateurs to hold blades!
 Lee, what are we gonna do?
 This is a problemΓÇª
 ΓÇÿCause if our opponents are amateurs, we canΓÇÖt go all outΓÇª
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Damn it! Let go of me!
 I need to avenge the deaths of my familyΓÇªand my little brother!
 Calm down!
 Calm down and think about this whole thing again!
 YourΓÇªlittle brother?
 DonΓÇÖt be stupid, GantetsuΓÇª DonΓÇÖt come over here right now!
 Gantetsu!
 What's going on?!
 Damn it, I canΓÇÖt move!
 ItΓÇÖs futile.
 That string is stronger than steel.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way youΓÇÖll be able to cut through it
 with human strength alone.
 Who the heck are you?
 IΓÇÖm Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Ninja Dropout you said?
 I, Monju will take Gantetsu.
 As long as I have him, I have no more business with you guys.
 Those nets will shrink as the temperature rises.
 So youΓÇÖll suffer till the end.
 In half an hour or soΓÇª
 It will cut you into pieces.
 Farewell!
 Todoroki!
 Gantetsu!
 Damn itΓÇª IΓÇÖm not about to die in a place like this.
 Our mission is to deliver Gantetsu to the capitalΓÇª
 Are you an idiot ? Take a good look at this situation!
 WeΓÇÖll be goners before that happens.
 I donΓÇÖt believe that those Ninja Dropouts are GantetsuΓÇÖs comrades.
 Gantetsu was telling the truth. Those guys might kill Gantetsu.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I should have killed him with my own hands!
 But remember, that guy was calling out your name to the very end!
 So whatΓÇÖs up with that?!
 There must be something he wanted to tell you!
 I donΓÇÖt want to hear any excuses from a thug!
 I find it hard to believe that GantetsuΓÇÖs that evil a guy.
 What was that?!
 IΓÇÖm telling you, IΓÇÖm not about to kick the bucket
 until IΓÇÖve heard what Gantetsu wanted to say!
 Stop it!
 Hey, IΓÇÖm positive we can work things out if we just talk.
 Shut up!
 Wait. 					LetΓÇÖs stop this.
 I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout, because youΓÇÖre a Ninja.
 WeΓÇÖre Shinobi from the Leaf Village.
 We were called here to be part of the police escort
 taking Gantetsu to the capital.
 Please spare Gantetsu.
 That canΓÇÖt happen.
 Gantetsu saved us from the Ninja Dropouts.
 Saved you?
 Who in the world are you guys?
 WeΓÇÖre all kids whose families were killed by the Ninja Dropouts.
 But Gantetsu secretly rescued us
 because he wanted to save at least the childrenΓÇª
 What was that?!
 Gantetsu took care of all of us kids who had become orphansΓÇª
 Gantetsu.
 Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Where am I?
 So you woke up.
 MotherΓÇª? FatherΓÇª?
 WhereΓÇÖs Mother?
 You poor thingΓÇª But weΓÇÖre all in the same boat.
 YouΓÇÖre not aloneΓÇª WeΓÇÖre here for youΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre your new family.
 IΓÇÖm leaving the Ninja Dropouts!
 I canΓÇÖt stand this any longer.
 I canΓÇÖt commit robberies with those guys anymore.
 But if you donΓÇÖt, theyΓÇÖll kill you, Gantetsu.
 IΓÇÖll steal their money.
 Huh?
 And IΓÇÖll get myself captured by the police.
 Come onΓÇª
 If I do that,
 theyΓÇÖll show up in front of the prison to try to get me back.
 ThatΓÇÖs the only way they can be captured.
 Are you saying youΓÇÖre gonna be a decoyΓÇª?
 It's so that there wonΓÇÖt be any more victims.
 This is my only choice.
 Gantetsu really did steal their money and was captured by the police.
 We came to this forest
 because we were worried about GantetsuΓÇÖs safety.
 We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts would get caught. HoweverΓÇª
 So Gantetsu reformed himself
 and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?
 We have to do something about the real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!
 I donΓÇÖt really care about the Ninja Dropouts right now.
 WhatΓÇÖs important is that we rescue Gantetsu.
 IΓÇÖm guessing that Gantetsu is with Naruto.
 DonΓÇÖt worry because he wonΓÇÖt have been captured by the Ninja Dropouts.
 Okay, letΓÇÖs believe that.
 DamnΓÇª
 If things continue like this, weΓÇÖll turn into dried fish.
 Huh?
 H-HeyΓÇª It loosens up a little when sweat soaks into it.
 What?
 Are you serious?
 Oh, youΓÇÖre right.
 Yeah, I knowΓÇª
 What?!
 IΓÇÖm used to its venom. ltΓÇÖs nothing.
 I find it hard to believe that GantetsuΓÇÖs that evil a guy.
 IΓÇÖm gonna meet up with Gantetsu one more time
 and find out for myself, no matter what it takesΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª I need to see Gantetsu again, too.
 I will then avenge the deaths of my familyΓÇªand of my little brother.
 We did it!
 That was a narrow escape!
 All rightΓÇª LetΓÇÖs hurry up and rescue Gantetsu!
 YeahΓÇª I will find him no matter what and I'll cut him down!
 Huh?
 ΓÇôGantetsu. 					ΓÇôHuh?
 ThatΓÇÖs definitely Gantetsu.
 Those guys areΓÇª
 I-IdiotΓÇª
 ΓÇôGantetsu! 					ΓÇôGantetsu!
 Gantetsu!
 ThatΓÇÖs as far as youΓÇÖll go, kid.
 That guy isΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt tell me heΓÇÖs a Ninja Dropout?!
 Good answer.
 IΓÇÖm Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Give Gantetsu back!
 IΓÇÖm not forgiving you for this!
 Hey, heyΓÇª
 Who are these little brats?
 Perhaps theyΓÇÖre inexperienced in the ways of the world, butΓÇª
 to tell me to give Gantetsu backΓÇª
 Give us back what we want. ThatΓÇÖs our line, right?
 Who the heck are you guys?
 You Ninja Dropout jerksΓÇª
 We are avenging our familiesΓÇÖ deaths!
 What?!
 You brats just stay quiet.
 Damn it!
 Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!
 It looks like you donΓÇÖt quite comprehend the position youΓÇÖre in right now, huh?!
 And moreover, what do they mean by avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!
 Stop!
 Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!
 ItΓÇÖs my turn!
 It doesnΓÇÖt even budge.
 ItΓÇÖs uselessΓÇª You wonΓÇÖt be able to tear through this net.
 Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.
 I refuse.
 HuhΓÇª I see.
 Then how about this?
 Akio!
 Stop it! I get it. IΓÇÖll talk, so please stop!
 You should have done that from the start.
 These children are the children from the homes
 that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.
 I rescued them and gave them shelter.
 What? You betrayed us?
 I seeΓÇª You jerkΓÇª
 You took our treasures and gave them to these guys.
 They belonged to their families in the first place.
 DonΓÇÖt mess around with meΓÇª You traitor!
 Stop that!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting!
 Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
 Naruto!
 Naruto, you were safe!
 Of course I was!
 IΓÇÖm not handing Gantetsu over to you no matter what!
 Gantetsu.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª!
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Is that the Ninja DropoutΓÇÖs hideout?
 Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.
 Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards. I can never forgive them.
 How dare they interfere with the happy reunion of the siblings!
 This is outrageous.
 All right, letΓÇÖs go, Bushy-Brows!
 IΓÇÖm always okay to go. Even if the enemy is an ex-ShinobiΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre going to beat them one and all,
 and definitely going to get TodorokiΓÇÖs brother back!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 Tenten vs. Temari
 The fifth battleΓÇª
 Tenten, TemariΓÇªcome forward!
 Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
 NowΓÇªThe second one from the Land of Sand, huhΓÇª
 Do your best!
 ΓÇô Tenten! ΓÇô It looks like it's going to be interesting.
 Begin!
 Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru
 Go for it, Tenten!
 Believe in your own strength, Tenten!
 WeΓÇÖre behind you, Tenten!
 Knock her with all your strength!
 ThatΓÇÖs good!
 Cheer her on more, more, more with passion, Lee!
 Yeah!
 These guys are noisy!
 That spacing is just what IΓÇÖd expect from Tenten,
 not too close, not too far.
 Attacks or defense, she can respond to either one.
 What happened?
 Please begin.
 Are you planning to wait out and see how I make my move?
 Let me just tell you,
 once I start my attack youΓÇÖll be over in a second.
 YouΓÇÖre trying to be cool and see what I do firstΓÇª
 A hundred years too early!
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter to me, come first.
 You said itΓÇª
 Well, I wonΓÇÖt hold back.
 They missed?
 ThatΓÇÖs impossible!
 What happened? ls that a warm-up?
 Or are you scared and your aim is off?
 I thought I would enjoy it a little bit more,
 but evidently itΓÇÖs not promising.
 No way!
 I canΓÇÖt believe TentenΓÇÖs attack missed!
 ItΓÇÖs unbelievable indeed.
 TentenΓÇÖs weapons...
 always hits the mark ten out of ten times.
 There no reason for them to miss.
 ThatΓÇÖs right... She didnΓÇÖt miss.
 She was made to miss.
 As always, sheΓÇÖs being disagreeable.
 How foolishΓÇª
 How disgraceful!
 Huh?
 Sand wins again.
 We donΓÇÖt know that yet.
 We know.
 How? 					How do we know?
 Explain it so I understand!
 Stupid... As if I'd do such a bothersome thing.
 Shikamaru said it so, surely thatΓÇÖs how it is.
 These guys are hard to understand.
 Calm downΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt let her get to youΓÇª
 One.
 Two.
 ThreeΓÇª
 If itΓÇÖs gonna get dodged,
 I just have to make it impossible to!
 So sheΓÇÖs measuring the spacing, next one is going to be the big attack.
 I get itΓÇª
 So, that fan is the secret.
 If soΓÇª
 How aboutΓÇªthis?!
 No way!
 My flying weapons!
 Is there a secret mechanism in the fanΓÇª?
 This isΓÇª
 the first star.
 There are two more.
 When the third star appears,
 you will lose.
 Tenten!
 DonΓÇÖt be taken in by your opponent, be calm!
 Be calm!
 I knowΓÇª
 Lee, I really intended to use this in the main battle,
 not the preliminary round--
 but it looks like I canΓÇÖt do it that way.
 SheΓÇÖs already going to use it?
 Pulling out two scrolls?
 What does she intend to do?
 Hah! No matter what you do, it wonΓÇÖt work.
 Rising Twin Dragons!
 Even if you increase the amount, itΓÇÖs still the same!
 Second star!
 IΓÇÖm not done yet!
 Did I do it?
 Third star.
 She disappeared!
 Where is she?
 IΓÇÖm over here!
 Darn--!
 Ninja Art!
 Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 Tenten!
 Chakra is enfolded in that wind.
 Huh?!
 Tenten fought wellΓÇª
 But she wonΓÇÖt be able to escape from that twister.
 T-ThatΓÇÖs awful.
 TentenΓÇª!
 How boring... really.
 To think she completely intercepted TentenΓÇÖs weapon attacks.
 This is ridiculous!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on with herΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs just like Shikamaru said, itΓÇÖs the SandΓÇÖs win.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I said it.
 ThereΓÇÖs no reason for us to lose here.
 The Land of Sand is to be fearedΓÇª
 Temari wins the fifth battle.
 Oh no!
 Nice catch.
 What are you doing?!
 Is that something you do to an opponent who fought to the utmost?!
 YouΓÇÖre annoying!
 Take that trash away already!
 Stop! Lee!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 What?!
 YouΓÇÖre just like you lookΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre dull too.
 What did you say?!
 Stop! Lee!
 Guy Sensei!
 Temari.
 Come up quick, youΓÇÖve been declared the winner.
 DonΓÇÖt keep company with that awful-looking guy and his chaperone forever.
 WhatΓÇª?!
 ThatΓÇÖs enough, Lee.
 Gentlemen of SandΓÇª
 I wonder if I may give you a word of warning.
 This kid is strong.
 You should prepare yourselves.
 Picking a fight with the SandΓÇª
 I absolutely wouldn't want to do it with those guys.
 T-TheyΓÇÖre all awesome guysΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt lose to those guys!
 Naruto!
 S-Sakura.
 SakuraΓÇª Are you okay already?
 Never mind that, you should worry about yourself!
 Huh? Me? I donΓÇÖt have an injury or anything.
 ThatΓÇÖs not what I mean.
 If you lose here, itΓÇÖs a point of dishonor.
 YouΓÇÖd be ashamed to face Sasuke!
 Y- Yeah.
 AndΓÇª
 Thanks for earlierΓÇª
 No!
 Sakura!
 You did your hardest to get here!
 YouΓÇÖll disgrace women if you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
 If it werenΓÇÖt for your stupid cheering at that timeΓÇª
 I would have been soundly beaten by Ino.
 Yeah, that's right.
 Y-You!
 Okay, hurry hurry! 					Me next!
 Next! 					Next is my turn!
 Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin
 Darn!
 ItΓÇÖs me.
 Shikamaru, donΓÇÖt lose!
 ΓÇô Show us that youΓÇÖre a real man! ΓÇô All right, all right.
 Get her with the 16 combo, go!
 ΓÇô Win Shikamaru! ΓÇô InoΓÇÖs become super energetic.
 You go for it!
 That guy manipulates shadows.
 Be careful of the shadowsΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt be beaten by a stupid technique like that.
 Shikamaru!
 Bash that one around! And while you're at it...
 Man, what a pain.
 Furthermore, my opponent is a womanΓÇª lt's hard to get to it.
 If thatΓÇÖs what you think, IΓÇÖll end this quickly.
 Go, go! Shikamaru!
 Well, you could say that I know these guysΓÇÖ raw power
 from that incident from the second testΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know anything about this oneΓÇÖs Jutsu.
 On top of that, sheΓÇÖs seen my JutsuΓÇª
 ΓÇô The sixth battle. ΓÇô That being said, for meΓÇª
 Shikamaru versus Kin!
 Begin!
 I can only do this.
 One trick pony, huhΓÇª?
 Shut up!
 Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 That Jutsu!
 ItΓÇÖs nothing if I just pay attention to the movement of your shadow!
 BellsΓÇª?
 Heh, thatΓÇÖs a classic.
 Next, youΓÇÖll throw Senbons with bells
 and Senbons without bells at the same time, right?
 IΓÇÖll respond to the sound of the bells, intending to dodge them.
 But I won't notice the quiet Senbons, and, ouch.
 Is that right?
 YouΓÇÖre a chatty guy!
 So in order to not get caught by the shadow SenbonsΓÇª
 I'm alert to the trick and look closelyΓÇª
 What?!
 Behind?!
 String?
 Darn it!
 Too late!
 Shikamaru!
 He took that pretty bad.
 It wasnΓÇÖt tat bad, look closely.
 Huh?
 F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.
 Now itΓÇÖs my turn!
 ThatΓÇÖs not going to happen.
 W-WhatΓÇÖs this?
 That happens to anyone who hears my bell.
 The sound vibration of this special bell
 reaches the brain directly from the ear drum.
 And then it will make you hallucinate.
 ItΓÇÖs useless!
 You canΓÇÖt avoid the sound of my bell by doing...
 that... that... that... that... that...
 Shoot! Which one? Which is the real one?
 You canΓÇÖt do anything, can you?
 Your shadow, which was your faint hope, doesnΓÇÖt even know where to stretch toΓÇª
 WellΓÇª IΓÇÖll cook you slowly.
 Taking me lightlyΓÇª!
 This time itΓÇÖs five, next time sevenΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll continue until you become a hedgehog.
 Y-YouΓÇÖre lying, you brat!
 Huh?!
 YouΓÇÖd end it soonΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what you said in the beginning, isnΓÇÖt it?
 I see, you canΓÇÖt endure the pain and want to be eased.
 Well, IΓÇÖll finish it here.
 ItΓÇÖs your death warrant.
 W-What?!
 M-My bodyΓÇª
 At last, Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success.
 W-What are you saying?
 No way! Your shadow isnΓÇÖt anywhere...
 You donΓÇÖt realize it yet?
 I-It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 It's just that, you fool!
 A thread at this height canΓÇÖt have a shadow.
 I can stretch and shrink my own shadow.
 The shadow is gradually getting thicker.
 This wasnΓÇÖt the shadow of the threadΓÇª
 That's right. I stretched my shadow and made it narrow,
 so it looked like the shadow of a thread and stuck it on you.
 ButΓÇª How do you win with that?
 IΓÇÖm just gonna move the same way as you.
 Annoying.
 Be quiet and watch.
 Stupid!
 If you continue like this and attackΓÇª
 You, too, 					will be wounded!
 I know that.
 No way! You're...!
 WeΓÇÖre gonna throw shuriken at each other.
 How far will we goΓÇª?
 Fool, stop it!
 You're only talk...
 And that one's a goner.
 If youΓÇÖre a shinobi,
 you have to grasp the situation and the layout when you battle.
 Even though we made the same movementsΓÇª
 the distance of the walls behind each of us was different.
 I just used the shuriken and
 called attention away from the wall behind us.
 Winner! Shikamaru Nara.
 Good job Shikamaru!
 Cool!
 Me nextΓÇª
 Me nextΓÇª Me nextΓÇª!
 That guyΓÇÖs dull and plain, but that was kinda cool.
 Shoot!
 IΓÇÖm the only one left.
 And the next match.
 The people left are one Sound ninja,
 me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.
 And that Sand guyΓÇª
 Just please spare me from that guy.
 This yearΓÇÖs rookie looks quite challengingΓÇª
 Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
 ItΓÇÖs here, itΓÇÖs here, itΓÇÖs here!
 What weΓÇÖve been waiting for!
 ItΓÇÖs finally my turn!
 Yeah! Lucky us!
 If itΓÇÖs this guy weΓÇÖll absolutely win, Akamaru!
 Yahoo!
 ΓÇô If IΓÇÖm not next, Sakura will despise me... ΓÇô I'm gonna do it!
 ΓÇô and call me Bushy Brow. ΓÇô I'm gonna go for it!
 ΓÇô If IΓÇÖm not next. Sakura will... ΓÇô Just watch me! Yay!
 This Lee kid, heΓÇÖs just like Guy was in the pastΓÇª
 Do your best, Naruto.
 Leave it to me.
 Well Naruto, show usΓÇª
 how much youΓÇÖve grown.
 IΓÇÖm going to do it!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Darn that Kiba!
 I hold back a little bit and he rides my brain.
 Yap, yap, yap, yap, itΓÇÖs annoying! Believe it!
 Just quit talking tough, and use your dog or whatever, and come at me!
 I donΓÇÖt know what kind of training youΓÇÖve done,
 but IΓÇÖm the man whoΓÇÖs going to become Hokage.
 YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs going to get his butt kicked.

 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...

 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love

 Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!
 Good morning!
 Here.
 Thank you.
 Naruto didn't come back last night, either?
 He's such a fool,
 he's been out every night, climbing trees.
 He might be dead already from using up too much Chakra.
 I wonder if Naruto's okay.
 To think a child's out in the middle of the night.
 Well, you don't need to worry.
 Although he may not seem to be, he's a full-fledged Ninja.
 I wonderΓÇª
 That idiot's probably all pooped out right about now.
 Sasuke?
 I'm going for a walk.
 But we're about to eatΓÇª
 That was fast!
 You'll catch a cold if you keep sleeping here.
 Who're you?
 Uh... Did you wake me up, sis? I mean, what're you doing here?
 I'm gathering medicinal herbs.
 Herbs?
 Yes. For healing injuries, sickness and the like.
 You got a lot to do early in the morning, sis...
 You, too.
 What've you been doing in a place like this so early?
 Training!
 Could it be thatΓÇª you're a Ninja or something?
 What with that headband andΓÇª
 Is that what I look like? Is it?
 Yup! I'm a Ninja!
 No kidding. You're great, aren't you.
 ButΓÇªwhy are you training?
 As for me, I want to get stronger!
 But, you already look strong enough.
 No, no! I want to get even stronger!
 What for?
 To become the best Ninja in my village!
 I'm going to get everyone to recognize my strength!
 And I have to prove something to a certain person!
 Is that for the sake of somebody? Or is it for your own sake?
 Huh?
 What's so funny?!
 Do you have somebody precious in your life?
 PreciousΓÇª?
 What is it you want to say, sis?
 What is it?
 When a person has something precious they want to protectΓÇª
 that's when they can truly become strong.
 Your dad loves the town you're from, soΓÇª
 I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed!
 Get your hands off Iruka Sensei!
 I'll kill you!!
 Yeah! I know that well, too!
 You'll get strong.
 Yeah!
 I hope we meet again somewhere.

 I'm a man!
 That can't be! He's cuter than Sakura.
 Why? That's strange.
 This world is full of mysteryΓÇª
 Ouch. Hey! What're you doing?!
 Did you forget about mealtime, you idiot?
 Naruto?
 What in the world is Naruto doing?
 And Sasuke hasn't come back from his walk eitherΓÇª
 No wayΓÇª Naruto can climb that high now?
 Wow!
 How 'bout that, how 'bout that?!
 As for me, I can climb this high now!
 Whoa!
 Oh, you idiot!
 This is bad!
 Gotcha!
 You fell for it, you fell for it!
 Don't scare us like that!
 I'll kill him later! Cha!
 He's grown a little, eh.
 Oh! You idiot, Naruto!
 It's cuz you went overboard!
 You fool.
 SasukeΓÇª?
 Nice, Sasuke. You're awesome !
 These kids are really growing.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Uzumaki, eh.
 You've recovered considerably.
 All rightΓÇª
 Just a little more, Haku.
 Yes.
 Shall we go back?
 Okay!
 They're late.
 And not just Naruto, but even Sasuke too.
 What happened to you guys?
 You're really muddy and really wiped out.
 We bothΓÇªclimbed up to the top.
 Good.
 Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guarding Tazuna next time!
 Got it! Whoa!
 You idiot!
 In just a teeny little bit, the bridge will be complete.
 It's thanks to you guys.
 Even so, don't let your guard downΓÇª
 I've really wanted to ask  you for a long time nowΓÇª
 But why are you still here even though I lied about the mission?
 To see what is right without doing it bespeaks an absence of courage.
 Like master, like man.
 It's a teaching of the late Hokage.
 The things I truly hold dear to myselfΓÇª
 I'll protect until the very end with both these arms.
 Don't cryΓÇªlnari.
 WhyΓÇª?
 What is it?
 Why do you desperately work so hard until you get like that?!
 There's no way you'd be a match for Gato's men even if you train!
 No matter what cool things you say or how much effort you makeΓÇª
 the weak always lose outΓÇª
 against the truly strong!
 Shut up. I'm not like you.
 Shut up! Looking at you makes me sick!
 Sticking your nose in even though you know nothing of this land!
 I'm not like you who's always acting frivolous
 not knowing one thing about pain!
 So you're just gonna cry all day like the lead in a tragedy?
 An idiot like you can just cry forever! You crybaby!
 Naruto! That's a bit harsh!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Got a minute?
 Naruto didn't mean any harm with what he saidΓÇª
 He's just uncouth, soΓÇª
 We heard the story about your father from Tazuna.
 Like you, Naruto never had a father as a young childΓÇª
 Actually he doesn't know either of his parents.
 Not only that. He didn't have a single friend.
 What?
 HoweverΓÇª
 I've never seen him sulk, be timid, or cry.
 He's always eager, wanting to be acknowledged by someone.
 If it's for the sake of that ""dream,"" he always risks his life.
 He's probably tired of crying.
 So, he knows the true meaning of the word strong.
 Like your father.
 Naruto might understand your feelings the most.
 What Naruto said earlierΓÇª
 There's no mistaking that he's told himself that over and over again.
 Okay, then! I leave Naruto in your hands.
 Because he's used his body to the limitΓÇª
 I don't think he'll be able to move today.
 Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right?
 Yes, somehow.
 We'll be going!
 What're you doing?
 I didn't hire you guys for charity workΓÇª
 Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?! Hey!!
 Shall we goΓÇªHaku?
 Yes.
 I overslept!
 Hey hey!! Where is everyone?
 Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you to rest and relaxΓÇªtoday
 I knew it.
 They left me behind.
 I'll be back.
 Darn it! They could've woken me up!
 W-What the heck is this?!
 What is going on? What's happened?
 It couldn't beΓÇª
 Inari! Give me a hand.
 Inari!?
 I'll be right there.
 This mistΓÇª
 Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!
 I knew he was still alive.
 Making an appearance so soon, ehΓÇª
 Say, Kakashi Sensei.
 This is hisΓÇªHidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
 I see you've got those brats with you as always.
 He's still trembling. Poor thing.
 I'm trembling withΓÇªexcitement.
 Do it, Sasuke.
 I can see it!
 Well-well. So he could see the Water Clones, eh.
 That brat's grown quite a bit.
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 Phew, that was a close shave.
 Sorry I was late. But Inari, you were great.
 I was able to save your mom thanks to your courage.
 Hey, wait a minute.
 Doesn't the fact that we were attacked mean
 that Kakashi Sensei and the others are in danger too?!
 Next episode:  ""Haku's Secret Jutsu: Crystal Ice Mirrors""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

189,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 YouΓÇÖve come back, Choji!
 Yay!
 Are you okay, Naruto!
 IΓÇÖm okay, but IΓÇÖm not okay with your heavy weight!
 IΓÇÖll get him right away!
 Stop it Choji! lt doesnΓÇÖt work on him!
 What?
 This water absorbs all the shocks and it gives me an iron-wall defense.
 Oh, really?
 Shoot!
 Flower Ninja Art: Bloom! Myriad of Flowers!
 IΓÇÖm saved.
 WhereΓÇÖd that guy go?!
 After a bonfire, you should put it out.
 There is a limit to your Kunai Knife,
 but my water that the earth gives me is infinite.
 His Ninjutsu is endless. So for nowΓÇª
 Wanna run away?
 Say that youΓÇÖll withdraw!
 You canΓÇÖt get away.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 After them!
 This way!
 If you get caught by that water, itΓÇÖs over for sure!
 ItΓÇÖs coming around from this side too.
 ItΓÇÖs trying to trap us!
 Run! Run! YouΓÇÖre all going to get eaten if you get caught!
 At this rate, weΓÇÖre eventually going to be defeated.
 Looks like weΓÇÖve gotta beat him up, after all.
 But how are we going to beat him
 if the attack doesnΓÇÖt work on him?
 Damn!
 Huh?
 Don't you think there's something weird about him?
 Wh-What is?
 HmmΓÇª I wonder?
 DonΓÇÖt be joking at a time like this!
 Perhaps, is Naruto talking about his tonfa?
 Oh yeah, heΓÇÖs holding his tonfa like a dowsing rod.
 ThatΓÇÖs it!
 ItΓÇÖs called dousing.
 If you concentrate on the item youΓÇÖre looking for,
 it will react to that item and inform you when you get near it.
 Dowsing?
 I see! Naruto, Choji!
 We might have a chance to win!
 Huh?
 If that tonfa is the secret of this Jutsu thenΓÇª
 Naruto!
 LetΓÇÖs rap up the chase!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Idiot.
 IΓÇÖm not going to let you get away!
 I've got you!
 Seems like you tried to get close to me, but too bad
 Damn it!
 IΓÇÖm going to prepare a special one for you.
 Wh-What Naruto?
 Hurry up and run, Choji!
 Yurinojou!
 Yurinojou! Choji!
 Choji!
 Behind you! Look behind you!
 I said look behind you!
 Choji!
 Choji!
 The fight is over.
 First, the big one, IΓÇÖll eat you first.
 Certainly the fight is over.
 A fight where youΓÇÖre going to lose.
 What?!
 Right now Choji! Drink up the water!
 Useless, useless.
 Water will gush out from the ground with no limits.
 Why isnΓÇÖt the water coming out?
 Like I said, itΓÇÖs useless.
 What happened?!
 The water that will protect you will not come out of here.
 Look carefully at the surroundings..
 Yes, water does not come out of this craggy place.
 IΓÇÖm full!
 Yurinojou has realized your secret.
 I also thought something was strange.
 When I went to check the trap,
 I decided to take the shortest route through the craggy area.
 It wouldnΓÇÖt have been strange to run into you thereΓÇª
 but that didnΓÇÖt happen.
 The answer to that is easy!
 You made a detour because you avoided craggy areas
 where the water wouldnΓÇÖt come out.
 The tonfa you hold is a weapon
 and was a way to find the water through dowsing.
 You lost them and you went away from your advantageous places.
 You meanΓÇª The reason why you cracked my tonfa wasΓÇª
 Of course, it wasnΓÇÖt a coincidence.
 It was planned by Yurinojou who calculated your actions.
 Damn itΓÇª!
 This one will be heavy because of the water!
 Human Boulder!
 You did it! Choji!
 Yurinojou!
 My ribs are injured, butΓÇª IΓÇÖm okay.
 But there should be three of them, so hurry and get the princess!
 I got it!
 Choji, please take care of Yurinojou.
 Okay!
 IΓÇÖll catch up to Hinata!
 Let me rest a little.
 I got it.
 LetΓÇÖs wait for everyone here.
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to wait.
 After we rest a little, you are going to take me to a safe place.
 But Naruto and the others are not yetΓÇª
 That doesnΓÇÖt matter!
 In the first place, everything became like this because of you guys.
 Instead of taking the long way,
 if we had used the merchant people as decoys,
 then we would have escaped by now!
 DecoysΓÇª? But Kikusuke has alreadyΓÇª
 What about it?
 If your mission as Ninja is to risk your life in the line of duty,
 then Kikunojou should be satisfied.
 Even though Kikunojou is dead,
 if I am still alive, then itΓÇÖs possible to revive the Land of the Green.
 Princess.
 Hinata, you wonΓÇÖt understand how I was separated from my parents
 to be held as hostage in a foreign country
 and how much I was bullied.
 I realized then that only fools would expect to live off of human compassion.
 Especially someone like Naruto
 who is easily influenced by peopleΓÇÖs emotions
 should be disqualified as a Ninja.
 He loses his rationality in his goal.
 Princess, what do you know about Naruto?
 Naruto has lived without his parents since he was a child.
 He has always lived alone.
 To be accepted by everyone, to become the next HokageΓÇª
 he has worked hardΓÇªreally hardΓÇª
 Despite all that, he didnΓÇÖt give up
 and he would never think of living at the expense of others.
 He tried and tried.
 Naruto and I are in different positions.
 IΓÇÖm sorry. YouΓÇÖre right, Princess.
 HinataΓÇª Do you like Naruto?
 I understand.
 LetΓÇÖs wait for everyone here.
 PrincessΓÇª
 That bag must be heavy.
 I will relieve you of some of the burden.
 Oh, thanks.
 I cannot die in a place like this.
 DonΓÇÖt you look nice, Ruiga.
 JigaΓÇª Help meΓÇª BrotherΓÇª
 Whatever.
 If you die, Brother Renga and I could split the Land of GreenΓÇÖs profits.
 JigaΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt blame me.
 W-Wait!
 S-Stop JigaΓÇª!
 Hinata!
 Hinata.
 N-NarutoΓÇª
 Where is the Princess?
 ThatΓÇÖs what I was going to ask!
 I said letΓÇÖs wait here and the minute I turned aroundΓÇª
 Why does a Ninja like you get beaten by an amateur?
 S-Sorry.
 Then right now she should be aloneΓÇª
 Naruto, we should first go back to the village
 and get advice from the Hokage.
 No! ThereΓÇÖs no time for that.
 There are still two Janin left.
 SheΓÇÖll get killed if she gets caught.
 But this really isnΓÇÖt an official mission.
 We might not be able to handle the other twoΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre rightΓÇª
 As you say, this may not be an official mission butΓÇª
 sheΓÇÖs trying really hard to escape by herself right now.
 The things she says and does may be wrong,
 but somehow, I canΓÇÖt leave her alone.
 Naruto, IΓÇÖll alsoΓÇª
 Hinata!
 Yurinojou got hurt.
 You and Choji, please take care of Yurinojou!
 See you later!
 Oh!
 Be careful, NarutoΓÇª
 Right there!
 I see, you have good instincts.
 IΓÇÖll praise you for getting Ruiga.
 Are you the second Janin?
 Oh, I feel honored that you know about me.
 Then you should brag about it in the other world.
 That Mr. Jiga killed you, so it couldnΓÇÖt be helped.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 What?
 That wouldnΓÇÖt work.
 This guyΓÇª
 What kind of Ninjutsu is he using?
 A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh? How interesting.
 IΓÇÖll put them down as one of my next targets.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do that!
 How didΓÇª?
 Yup.
 My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet.
 ItΓÇÖs like this!
 I will live, no matter whatΓÇª
 This is your graveyard.
 I will return those words right back at you.
 You!
 Then.
 There!
 Damn! 					WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 What should I do? I can't find Choji.
 I'm sure that he's somewhere hiding his presence, butΓÇª
 This isΓÇª NarutoΓÇÖs forehead band.
 NarutoΓÇª
 I grew up drinking iron.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I can use the iron
 that has accumulated in my body and turn myself into a magnet.
 This rocky mountain contains lots of iron,
 making it my invincible battle-field.
 Change yourself into magnetΓÇª?
 By the way, I could also change the things I touch into magnets.
 IΓÇÖve already changed the rocks behind you into powerful magnets.
 So what are you trying to do?!
 I mean this! Ninja Art Magnet: Infinite Meteors!
 Second hit! Third hit!
 Naruto!
 Your friendΓÇª IΓÇÖll take good care of her.
 Hinata! DonΓÇÖt come!
 He isΓÇª
 He isΓÇªa dangerousΓÇªopponentΓÇª
 Naruto!
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 What should I do?
 My Gentle Fist wonΓÇÖt work against his Ninja Art.
 ItΓÇÖs frustrating, but I canΓÇÖt win against him if I fight him head on.
 At this rate, Naruto willΓÇª
 No, no, I wonΓÇÖt let that happen.
 I will discover the weakness of his Jutsu.
 I wonΓÇÖt give up! IΓÇÖll stop him, no matter what!
 Next time: ΓÇ£The Byakugan Sees the Blind Spot!ΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖm going to risk everything in this single attack!

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so donΓÇÖt hide your fists
 YouΓÇÖre not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 DonΓÇÖt forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off

 Because they want to change something
 A Battle of Bugs!               The Deceivers and the Deceived!
 What the heck is happeningΓÇª?
 Why does Hinata have to be kidnapped?!
 Why are there guys who know that weΓÇÖre searching for Bikochu?!
 We were being watched all this time. Ever since we arrivedΓÇª
 You were aware of that?!
 YouΓÇÖre the only one who didnΓÇÖt know.
 Why didnΓÇÖt you tell me?!
 Because if we told you, youΓÇÖd have raised a big fuss!
 And the insects would flee! All the insectsΓÇª!
 Including the Bikochu!
 If they tried to steal the Bikochu from us through force,
 the insects would be in danger of getting hurt.
 So they captured Hinata and decided to go with a hostage exchange.
 ThatΓÇÖs very smart of them.
 Something smells sweetΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the smell of honey.
 BeeΓÇÖs honeyΓÇª
 BeesΓÇª?
 HinataΓÇÖs scent ends hereΓÇª
 In that caseΓÇª
 Those guys waited for a moment when Hinata was alone
 and attacked her using bees.
 IΓÇÖve heard that in the Hidden Stone Village in the Land of Earth,
 thereΓÇÖs a clan of insect handlers who primarily use bees.
 The name of that clan isΓÇª the Kamizuru Clan.
 KamizuruΓÇª? ThatΓÇÖs a name that isnΓÇÖt heard very often.
 Seems they were once hailed as being at a level equal to the Aburame ClanΓÇª
 But they arenΓÇÖt anymore?
 This is a story from the times of my grandfatherΓÇª
 There was a time when the Shinobi of the Hidden Stone Village
 were going to invade the Leaf VillageΓÇª
 The Kamizuru Clan was designated to spearhead the operationΓÇª
 The plan was to create a disruption by releasing
 a large swarm of bees into the village followed by an invading main unitΓÇª
 However, the Aburame Clan wised up to that
 and prepared to engage the enemy in the forest to the west!
 This battle between insect handlers which had no precedent in historyΓÇª
 ended in the AburameΓÇÖs victoryΓÇª
 With this battle as the turning point,
 the Aburame Clan rose to unchallenged status
 in the Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clan was subjected to cold treatment
 even in their own village.
 IΓÇÖve heard that only a few of them remain nowΓÇª
 So those people came here to capture Bikochu, huh?
 What the heck are those guys planning to do with the Bikochu?
 If my insects come back we might be able to learn somethingΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª I've been capturedΓÇª
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves is in a difficult situation right nowΓÇª
 Because of that incident at the recent Chunin exam?
 The Hokage was assassinated, and I hear they lost many Shinobi too.
 Times are about to change dramaticallyΓÇª
 This is a chance for us, the Kamizuru Clan,
 to distinguish ourselves.
 But to do thatΓÇª
 The founderΓÇÖs Book of Secrets, huh?
 A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu for Insect Handlers
 are apparently inscribed therein among other thingsΓÇª
 If we possessed that at the time of the battle with the Aburame Clan,
 we wouldnΓÇÖt have lostΓÇª
 However, Clan members have continued to search for it for many years,
 but couldnΓÇÖt find it.
 Do you really think we can find it after all this time?
 ThatΓÇÖs why we need the Bikochu ΓÇª
 I brought the keepsakes of the founder, my grandfather, with meΓÇª
 When the Bikochu emerges, it will pursue the scent it recognizes.
 And we should be able to locate the Book of Secrets
 that Grandfather hid just as he was dying.
 This strand of his hair will surely lead us to it.
 If we get our hands on the Book of Secrets
 and if we engage in some big actionΓÇª
 I am certain thatΓÇª the people of the village will also acknowledge us.
 Those people are also desperately seeking recognition.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Did you find out anything? How about HinataΓÇÖs whereabouts?
 NoΓÇª The other insects were probably also done in by those guys.
 Damn! Then our only choice is to do what they want?
 When I went to all that trouble of finding itΓÇª
 So you want to desert Hinata?
 H-How could anyone possibly do that?!
 I wonΓÇÖt desert her no matter what might happen!
 Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!
 Exactly.
 But then weΓÇÖd be able to locate Sasuke if we have this guy hereΓÇª
 Well, I guess weΓÇÖll have to think of some other method of finding Sasuke.
 YeahΓÇª Right now, the first thing we need to do is rescue Hinata.
 But, do you think Hinata would be satisfied with that?
 The person who originally thought up this plan was Hinata.
 Huh? ButΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs true that I told her about the existence of BikochuΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 The odds of finding a Bikochu are extremely lowΓÇª
 We thought that she should aspire to an important mission
 with an assured outcome for the village, rather than a mission with such low odds.
 But Hinata didnΓÇÖt give up.
 She argued persistently that if there was even a small possibility,
 one should take on the challenge.
 Th-That Hinata didΓÇª?
 She was extremely forceful and Shino and I had no choice but to agree.
 ItΓÇÖs the first time Hinata ever volunteered for a mission.
 For that reason too, I want to make this a success.
 Yeah.
 But when we donΓÇÖt know where Hinata is, how are weΓÇª?
 There is one place where Hinata will definitely make an appearance.
 I see! The place whereΓÇª
 ΓÇªthe exchange with the Bikochu takes place!
 We will definitely have a chance at that time.
 All right! We will recover Hinata without failΓÇª
 and we will also protect the Bikochu to the very end!
 We brought the Bikochu! Return Hinata!
 Place the insect cage on that rock over there!
 Hinata!
 Release Hinata!
 I must verify it first!
 WhatΓÇÖsΓÇªthe meaning of this?!
 Are you trying to make a mockery of our Clan? Of insect handlers?!
 A goliath beetleΓÇª You gotta be kidding!
 Now, Shino!
 What?!
 Parasitic Insects!
 Heh! Recovery successful!
 All right!
 Damn!
 Naruto!
 All right, resign yourselves!
 Your timeΓÇÖs up!
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 This one doesnΓÇÖt smell like Hinata!
 Huh?!
 Just as I thoughtΓÇª
 BeeswaxΓÇª?
 There they come!
 Damn! You jerk! You jerk!
 Damn! All these things are honeyΓÇª?!
 Sorry, NarutoΓÇª But these damn bees!
 ThereΓÇÖs no end to them!
 Do we need to slash them if theyΓÇÖre honey?!
 You two donΓÇÖt move from there!
 Huh?
 This is the genuine thing! And furthermore, it contains deadly poison.
 It appears that genuine ones are mixed inΓÇª
 But theyΓÇÖre indistinguishable from each other!
 Back me up for a little!
 Wall of Insects Jutsu!
 A-AwesomeΓÇª
 Amazing power for a GeninΓÇª
 As might be expected from the Aburame ClanΓÇªI guess.
 The Kamizuru ClanΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª? So you were aware of that fact.
 Return Hinata!
 Of course, our intention was to return herΓÇª
 But only if you calmly hand over the Bikochu.
 HoweverΓÇª
 It looks like you have no intention of doing that!
 In that case, what do you plan on doing?
 If youΓÇÖre an insect handler,
 you wouldnΓÇÖt bring a delicate insect like the Bikochu
 to a dangerous place like a battlegroundΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll finish you off right hereΓÇª
 and take our time afterwards to search for the Bikochu!
 Wall of Insects Jutsu!
 That one doesnΓÇÖt have any other tricks, huh!
 Shino! Paper Bombs!
 Take this!
 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
 Insect ClonesΓÇª?
 Up to your annoying tricks, huhΓÇª
 Shino! What are we gonna do now?!
 DonΓÇÖt you think we should go back there for a moment?
 Those guys might find the Bikochu!
 NoΓÇªthat location will definitely be safe.
 More importantly, the first thing we need to do is search for Hinata!
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 Inside here.
 Hinata! Where are you?!
 Hey! Be careful!
 ThereΓÇÖs no sign of those guys, but it might be a trapΓÇª
 Is she there?!
 HinataΓÇª?
 Hinata!
 Are you all right, Hinata?
 IΓÇÖll rescue you in a moment!
 Just a little more!
 All rightΓÇª I got it off!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Thank you!
 H-HinataΓÇª?!
 H-HinataΓÇªstop that!
 What do you think youΓÇÖre doing, out of the blue like that?!
 WhoΓÇªare you?
 What are you talking about, Shino? ThatΓÇÖs Hinata.
 If youΓÇÖre really Hinata,
 youΓÇÖd get red in the face and faint if you hugged Naruto.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Oh!
 I seeΓÇª But AkamaruΓÇÖs nose wouldnΓÇÖt failΓÇª
 What? The smell of two people is mingled?
 YouΓÇÖre not Hinata?
 NarutoΓÇª ItΓÇÖs meΓÇª IΓÇÖm Hinata, believe me.
 In that caseΓÇª
 show us what you tried to stick on NarutoΓÇÖs back right now!
 A Paper Bomb?
 So you were intending to blow up Naruto!
 I thought that would workΓÇª
 You areΓÇª
 I see, the one on the hill was a clone, huhΓÇª
 Wearing HinataΓÇÖs clothesΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs how she was able to compromise the smell.
 Where is the real Hinata?!
 I wonder where she could be?
 I seeΓÇª
 Suzumebachi lured the Aburame Clan, huh?
 Well, it appears that your comradesΓÇª
 place more value on the Bikochu than on you.
 ThereΓÇÖs nobody else coming to rescue you.
 Jibachi, LetΓÇÖs search for the Bikochu that those guys hid!
 ThereΓÇÖs not much time until sunrise!
 Right!
 DonΓÇÖt even try to escape.
 If you make even the smallest movement out of the ordinary,
 those bees will cut the string.
 Up ahead is the entrance to a labyrinthine underground water veinΓÇª
 If you fall in, youΓÇÖll pass into the other world in an instant.
 We donΓÇÖt wish to kill anyone unnecessarily.
 If you want to live, I suggest you just stay quiet.
 How mortifyingΓÇª I ended up being a burden to everyone, after all.
 You guys are just like summer insects who fly right into the fire!
 If youΓÇÖre lucky, weΓÇÖll meet againΓÇª
 That place isnΓÇÖt just an ordinary cave.
 Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing else to grab on to.
 Be patient until IΓÇÖve checked the surroundings!
 No!
 A huge number of bee larvae!
 Bee larvae, huhΓÇª?
 But whatΓÇÖs with their unusual huge size?
 If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu, IΓÇÖll spare your life.
 I refuse!
 Searching for the Bikochu is the mission that we were given!
 Then die!
 Paper Bombs!
 Damn! LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru!
 Fang Over Fang!
 That sound isΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª TheyΓÇÖre still continuing to fight without giving up.
 This is not the time to be cryingΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way that I can give up. I suggested this whole thing!
 Byakugan!
 There are 13 beesΓÇª attached to the string.
 If I can take them all down at onceΓÇª IΓÇÖll be saved.
 But, to take down bees that smallΓÇª
 Impossible! This guyΓÇª
 I told you beforeΓÇª I don't knowΓÇªwhen to give up.
 NarutoΓÇª
 YesΓÇª I wonΓÇÖt give up either!
 I need to concentrate and control my ChakraΓÇª
 Fang Over Fang!
 How many of them are thereΓÇª?!
 Kiba!
 I-I canΓÇÖt muster any strengthΓÇª Somehow my body isΓÇª
 No way!
 The larvae in this hiveΓÇÖs favorite food is Chakra!
 What?!
 As long as youΓÇÖre in there,
 theyΓÇÖll go through the wall to suck up the ChakraΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the matterΓÇª?
 So have you decided to tell me the location?
 Now!
 FourΓÇª
 Five, sixΓÇªtenΓÇª
 Eleven, twelve, thirteenΓÇª
 Damn!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Would you like to be the feed for the larvaeΓÇª
 or would you like to get out of here and become the prey of this girl here?
 Choose whichever you like!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 What should I do? My body wonΓÇÖt move.
 I proposed this mission myself wanting to help Naruto, and yetΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt want to end up as a burden to everyone anymore,
 thatΓÇÖs what I aimed for, but ΓÇª
 No, calm down.
 I need to concentrate my Chakra and remember that training!
 I have no choice but to do it now! That is the best I can do right now!
 Next time: ΓÇ£Blaze Away, Byakugan! This is My Ninja Way!!ΓÇ¥

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so donΓÇÖt hide your fists
 YouΓÇÖre not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 DonΓÇÖt forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Pure Betrayal,                                 and a Fleeting Plea!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Grab on!
 Okay, pull him up!
 There, eh?!
 Damn! Was it a clone?!
 Over here!
 Counterattack, here it comes!
 Rasengan, go!
 What--?!
 You littleΓÇª!
 Yes!
 Be careful, Naruto! There are two others hiding!
 Hey, there they are!
 Kagero!
 LetΓÇÖs retreat for now!
 Hold it!
 Th-TheyΓÇÖre totally quick at running away!
 Naruto, whyΓÇÖre you spacing out?!
 WhereΓÇÖs Sakura?
 Oh! Oh, no!
 Sakura!
 Oh! NarutoΓÇª
 Thank goodness! YouΓÇÖre okay, Sasame.
 YesΓÇª SasameΓÇÖs okay.
 Sasame's totally okay.
 WhatΓÇÖre you mad about?
 LetΓÇÖs take a break here.
 SakuraΓÇªWhoΓÇÖs the cute girl?
 Okay! ThatΓÇÖs close enoughΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the dealΓÇªSakura?
 Okay, donΓÇÖt come any closer!
 Wh-WhatΓÇª IΓÇÖm only interested in adult women!
 You must not misunderstandΓÇª!
 DonΓÇÖt misunderstand!
 ItΓÇÖs not a misunderstanding.
 It seems SakuraΓÇÖs finally figured out Pervy SageΓÇÖs true nature!
 I told you to stop calling me a ΓÇ£Pervy SageΓÇ¥!
 Then youΓÇÖre the Lewd Sage!
 Both of you stop it! SasameΓÇÖs scared!
 ΓÇô Okay. 					ΓÇô Okay.
 JeezΓÇª
 This girl is SasameΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs a Ninja from the Land of Rice PaddiesΓÇª
 A member of the Fuma Clan.
 She had her cousin taken away by Orochimaru
 and was looking for his hideout.
 Right. And the Ninja just now were after Sasame
 in order to protect the secret of the hideout!
 OhΓÇªWith the Fuma Clan, huh?
 Huh?! You know?
 I had contact with Ninja in the town whoΓÇÖd left the Fuma Clan.
 What! So you were actually doing some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!
 I-I canΓÇÖt believe itΓÇª!
 Well you see, when I went to this nice-looking bar,
 it just turned out to be their hideout.
 What! So after all, you were just hanging out with some girls, right?
 You mustnΓÇÖt talk in a way thatΓÇÖll lead to a misunderstanding!
 Even Sakura who respects me willΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve long since stopped respecting you!
 IΓÇªI seeΓÇª
 Members of the Fuma ClanΓÇª?
 Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki or somethingΓÇª
 Hanzaki and the others are traitors who abandoned the clan.
 OhΓÇª
 Did those people do something?
 They were after my travel money, so I taught them a lesson.
 While at it, I attempted to ask them about OrochimaruΓÇÖs hideoutΓÇª
 but they didnΓÇÖt know anything.
 I can show you the way to OrochimaruΓÇÖs hideout.
 For real?!
 YesΓÇª
 All right!
 Your wound hasnΓÇÖt healed yet. DonΓÇÖt push yourself.
 YesΓÇªbutΓÇª
 This is the entrance to the Village Hidden in Sound.
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs hideout is deep in those mountainsΓÇª
 I bet Sasuke is somewhere in those mountainsΓÇª
 Okay, at last!
 LetΓÇÖs hurry!
 Well, hold onΓÇª
 Why?!
 If we donΓÇÖt hurry, night will fall before we arrive at OrochimaruΓÇÖs hideoutΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 Sasuke is just a stoneΓÇÖs throw away! Pervy Sage!
 If weΓÇÖre going to save him, we should do it as soon as possible!
 Why do we have to wait?!
 HuhΓÇª?
 What?
 GeeΓÇª
 WellΓÇªIΓÇÖm hungry, you seeΓÇª
 You knowΓÇª All Shinobi must ΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt fight if IΓÇÖm hungry!
 Up ahead will become full-blown enemy territory.
 We wonΓÇÖt have time to have relaxed meals, soΓÇª
 Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!
 Mm, this is goodΓÇª
 You prepared this especially for us?
 No. It seems the prettiest girl in the bar fell to my charm, you see.
 She made these with tender loving care.
 IΓÇÖll go make some tea.
 OhΓÇªthanksΓÇª
 Tastes pretty good.
 Tea is ready.
 Here you go!
 Here you go.
 ThanksΓÇª
 Here you go.
 Thank you, SasameΓÇª
 Sasame, you should come here and eat with us, too.
 OkayΓÇª
 Pervy SageΓÇªWhatΓÇÖs wrongΓÇª?!
 NarutoΓÇª!
 Sasame did itΓÇª
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, theyΓÇÖre ours.
 Your wound still hasnΓÇÖt healed.
 Kagero, you wait here.
 No mistakeΓÇªTheyΓÇÖre Leaf Ninja.
 If we take care of the Leaf pursuersΓÇª
 Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge the power of the Fuma Clan.
 YeahΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs come back with good news.
 And with the heads of the Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!
 I finally found it!
 At first, I thought it was someone from the Hidden Leaf Village.
 But itΓÇÖs Sasame, believe it or notΓÇª
 Kamikiri, Jigumo, KageroΓÇª
 This is an odd reunion.
 WhereΓÇÖs Arashi?! He wasnΓÇÖt with all you guys?!
 Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru and is spending his days training.
 Can I see Arashi?!
 If youΓÇÖre also going to work together with us for Lord Orochimaru,
 IΓÇÖm sure youΓÇÖll be able to see him.
 HowΓÇÖd it go?
 YouΓÇÖve done well.
 With this, IΓÇÖll be able to see Arashi, right?
 After weΓÇÖve finished them off!
 Why?! WerenΓÇÖt we just supposed to take them to Lord Orochimaru
 for examination after capturing them?!
 We only need the heads for the examination.
 No!
 These peopleΓÇª For my sakeΓÇª!
 Move it!
 ΓÇô Wha--?! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 What?!
 The Fuma numbing medicine didnΓÇÖt work!
 We knew about it all along from the beginning!
 Sakura!
 SubstitutionΓÇª?!
 I leave Sasame to you!
 Leave her to me!
 SasameΓÇª Hang in there!
 WhyΓÇª? Why does Sasame have to do something like this?!
 No, itΓÇÖs not that sheΓÇÖs doing it against her willΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs something she wanted to do!
 Liar!
 ItΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª
 What should I do to be able to see Arashi again?
 ItΓÇÖs not a difficult thing.
 You just have to put the lights out of those who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.
 We have to kill themΓÇª?!
 WeΓÇÖll take them back to Lord Orochimaru for examination.
 So weΓÇÖre not going to kill, right?
 If we carry out that work, Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.
 Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone are being tricked by Orochimaru.
 He says that youΓÇÖll just be used and thrown awayΓÇª
 HanzakiΓÇÖs just a traitor who abandoned the village.
 Will you believe what we say?
 Or will you believe what a traitor says?
 Lord Orochimaru will surely restore our Fuma ClanΓÇª
 Sasame, although youΓÇÖre still young, youΓÇÖre also one of the Fuma.
 Assist in the restoration of our Fuma ClanΓÇª
 So you guys did trick Sasame!
 ItΓÇÖs all for the restoration of the Fuma Clan!
 You little!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here I go!
 Wha--!
 U-zu-ma-kiΓÇª!
 Naruto Barrage!
 This is badΓÇª!
 Rasengan!
 This is for Sasame. Prepare yourselves!
 Naruto!
 YouΓÇÖreΓÇªfrom before?!
 The Earth Style Jutsu user in question, huh?
 However, thereΓÇÖs no point to using that Art in this rocky area.
 Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from inside the ground
 and the spreading of its wings under the sunlight is
 but a momentary gleam.
 ThatΓÇÖs when I die as Kagero!
 Be careful!
 WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?
 Look! NarutoΓÇª
 Wha--?!
 U-Unbelievable!
 You were a womanΓÇª?!
 The clan will once again be in a place lit by the sunlightΓÇª
 Lord Orochimaru promised thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll use this once-in-a-lifetime Art if itΓÇÖs for the sake of that.
 Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!
 Naruto! Come with me!
 Naruto!
 I-I feel likeΓÇªIΓÇÖve seen this beforeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.
 I summoned the extraordinarily sturdy stomach of
 the Mount MyobokuΓÇÖs lwajuku Giant Toad.
 StomachΓÇª?
 Yikes!
 ItΓÇÖs meltingΓÇª
 If I didnΓÇÖt do this,
 we wouldnΓÇÖt have been able to defend ourselves from her Chakra.
 I believedΓÇªthat the clan would somedayΓÇª
 I believed in that.
 Sh-She vanished.
 IΓÇÖve got to hand it to her.
 She probably put all of her life on the line
 and attempted to save her comradesΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs unforgivable!
 Those guysΓÇª 					the Fuma NinjaΓÇª
 Their feelings toward the clan is the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the FumaΓÇÖs desire to restore their clanΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll kick OrochimaruΓÇÖs butt, no matter what!
 Wh-Where are we?
 KageroΓÇª!
 You risked your life to save us?
 You idiotΓÇª
 PleaseΓÇª
 Please use your Medical Ninjutsu to save her.
 Our comrade doesnΓÇÖt have long to live!
 Put your hands to your chests and think.
 Think about what you werenΓÇÖt able to accomplishΓÇªokay?
 We risked our lives working for youΓÇª to help you, Lord Orochimaru.
 In order to restore the Fuma Clan!
 Please recognize our work!
 YouΓÇÖll just have to atone for your failure with your bodies.
 Lord Orochimaru!
 IΓÇÖm sorry for the betrayal!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs OrochimaruΓÇÖs residence!
 It really is just like him to construct his residence underground.
 Sasuke is somewhere inside that residence, right?
 Sakura, letΓÇÖs hurry!
 Right!
 Be careful! First Avenue of hell is up ahead!
 Will a devil appear, or will a snake appear?
 Heh! IΓÇÖm looking forward to it!
 IΓÇÖll kick the butts of the devil and the snake.
 And IΓÇÖll save Sasuke and Arashi!

 ItΓÇÖs the chiefΓÇÖs tongueΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt take me for a fool!

 What kind of strength does this guy possess?
 This doesnΓÇÖt look goodΓÇª!

 You will be killed by me! I will not cease to exist!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 Besides just the Sound Ninja, I wouldnΓÇÖt have imagined that
 this many of the Sand Jonin would enter into the village, too!
 Well, itΓÇÖs understandable. This is what is called war.
 ItΓÇÖs taking much too long.
 ItΓÇÖs impossible for a battle between Shinobi to last this long.
 What the heck is happening inside?
 YouΓÇÖre still grabbing my armΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt use my Jutsu this wayΓÇª
 Come on, let go of me once and for all.
 IΓÇÖm not letting your ambitions interfere with the villageΓÇªany longerΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no stopping my ambitions! You will die here!
 You old dotardΓÇª
 As the Third Hokage,
 are you saying you still have the power to save this village?
 Do you understandΓÇª the current situation?!
 Many Hidden Sand Shinobi and my subordinates
 have infiltrated this village.
 Your sideΓÇªthe Leaf ShinobiΓÇª
 will be annihilated down to every last woman and child!
 I will accomplish the destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village!
 ItΓÇÖs empty inside!
 ThereΓÇÖs nobody there!
 ThatΓÇÖs very strangeΓÇª
 Huh?
 Why is there so little resistance when weΓÇÖve closed in
 all the way to the center of the Hidden Leaf Village?
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 And alsoΓÇªthereΓÇÖs not one woman or child in sight.
 What is the reason for that?
 Huh?!
 KonohamaruΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Konohamaru?
 I gotta use the toilet.
 M-Me tooΓÇª
 I do tooΓÇª
 K-KonohamaruΓÇª!
 This is an emergency situation!
 If the enemy finds us, it will cost us!
 Go back to the other room and stay quiet!
 I-ItΓÇÖs not thatΓÇª I gotta pee!
 Hold it!
 I donΓÇÖt think I can hold itΓÇª
 Gimme a break. ln that case, come along with meΓÇª
 Can't hold it!
 Can't! Can't holdΓÇª!

 Hayate.
 ThatΓÇÖs the signal. LetΓÇÖs go!

 You donΓÇÖt get it, do you, Orochimaru?
 DonΓÇÖt underestimate the Shinobi of this Village!
 Are you all right?
 YeahΓÇª
 Is thatΓÇªthe last?
 Yes, the evacuation is complete!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs happening?
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves has an instruction manual
 outlining what to do in case of a sneak attack by the enemy.
 Step One: Eliminate the enemyΓÇÖs sneak attack force.
 In case one is unable to eliminate them,
 proceed immediately to Step Two.
 The immediate evacuation of noncombatants!
 Evacuate the women and children to shelters around the village!
 When that has been completed, proceed to Step Three!
 Step ThreeΓÇª?
 Through the collective strength and efforts of the Village,
 eliminate the enemy!
 In that caseΓÇª!
 The counteroffensiveΓÇªstarts now!
 We will not allow you to take even one step beyond this point!
 Sakura!
 Rescue Sakura, if itΓÇÖs the last thing you do!
 IΓÇÖll protect Sakura no matter what!
 You will be killed by me. I will not cease to exist.

 I will protect everyone!

 D-Did he winΓÇª?
 A simple head blowΓÇª
 His manner of fighting is incredibly clumsy,
 but to think that he could squeeze out Chakra at that critical stage.
 IΓÇÖve never seen a knucklehead Ninja like him before, butΓÇª
 he sure is the first phenomenal kid IΓÇÖve seen in a long time.
 ItΓÇÖs too bad that I canΓÇÖt see this through to the end,
 but IΓÇÖve reached my limit.
 Gamakichi, letΓÇÖs head home!
 Okay! Pop!
 As might be expected, even IΓÇª am empty nowΓÇª
 You are too, arenΓÇÖt you?
 WeΓÇÖre much alikeΓÇª letΓÇÖs make this time the last!
 It appears thatΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt have the strength left to yank out your entire soul.
 However, your ambition ends here!
 Not yet!
 ThereΓÇÖs no stopping my ambition!
 I have a suitable punishment for you
 who have become addicted to the Jutsu and who have overindulged in the Jutsu!
 I will take all your Jutsu away with me!
 What did you say?!
 There!
 DonΓÇÖt tell me that..?
 Stop that!
 Seal!
 MyΓÇªMy armsΓÇª
 NowΓÇªyou can no longer use either of your arms.
 And since you canΓÇÖt use your arms, you canΓÇÖt weave Signs.
 You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
 Your ambition of crushing the Hidden LeafΓÇªdies right here!

 Orochimaru, you foolΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunate that we canΓÇÖt leave together,
 but, my discipleΓÇª

 a role in the shadows

 Lord Third HokageΓÇª

 to the young Shinobi in the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 But thank goodness your injury wasnΓÇÖt serious.
 Naruto was relieved, tooΓÇª
 The rumors were trueΓÇª
 That the survivor of the VillageΓÇÖs honorable Uchiha Clan
 was the most good-for-nothing kidΓÇª
 Sasuke, you must be hungry. ls there something you want to eat?
 IΓÇÖll go buy something for you.
 The Battle Begins: Naruto vs. Sasuke
 To be honest, I really donΓÇÖt understand.
 It seems there were opinions that,
 with the final exam being suspended,
 no one should pass this time around.
 But I hear the late Third Hokage highly praised your match.
 It seems he intended to recommend you for Chunin.
 The lords of other lands who observed the fight
 and the proctors were of the same opinion as wellΓÇª
 In that case, itΓÇÖs not in my place to say this or that about it.
 From now on,
 strive to perform in a manner that is worthy of that headbandΓÇª
 Congratulations! As of today, youΓÇÖre a Chunin!
 ΓÇô WowΓÇª 					ΓÇô Wow!
 Even you whoΓÇÖs never motivated look respectable.
 It doesnΓÇÖt suit you.
 DonΓÇÖt laugh, I sayΓÇª
 For the time being,
 letΓÇÖs have a toast to celebrate ShikamaruΓÇÖs promotion to Chunin!
 LetΓÇÖs eat!
 Oh! Choji!
 DonΓÇÖt eat the meat before the toast!
 But, itΓÇÖd be a waste if it got burned, soΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a lot of meat. Eat up!
 All right!
 Right now, I have no interest in youΓÇª
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 YouΓÇÖll end up in the hospital again, Choji.
 DonΓÇÖt you know how to savor the taste?
 Never mind!
 Even if I eat a lot, I know how to savor properly.
 Hey! Choji, thatΓÇÖs the last piece of meat that IΓÇÖve been grilling!
 The last bite!
 This is the conclusion and
 will become the meat with the greatest value that should be savored!
 I wonΓÇÖt hand over this last bite to anyone!
 WhatΓÇÖre you acting cool for, you idiot?!
 Everyone makes fun of you because youΓÇÖre like this!
 ΓÇô YouΓÇÖre just a fa-- ΓÇô Ino!
 ThatΓÇÖs a taboo word!
 But really, ChojiΓÇª
 A meal isnΓÇÖt a battle.
 Relax at a time like this at least. What a pain.
 Vulgar... Dirty-mouthedΓÇª Too lazyΓÇª
 I wonder if these guys will be okay from here.
 In particularΓÇª
 Choji. With you itΓÇÖs nothing but food.
 Do a little training sometime!
 ChojiΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre lucky that your mind doesnΓÇÖt restrict what you eatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve got it rough with a diet.
 Why do you have to diet, Ino?
 Girls want to be seen as cute as possible by the one they like!
 But that person might not always like a thin person.
 In the first place, most boys donΓÇÖt like fa--
 Not thatΓÇª They like thin girls.
 And, vice-versa.
 You should be a little more conscious of your body, Choji.
 You wonΓÇÖt be popular.
 HehΓÇª She doesnΓÇÖt get it.
 Men donΓÇÖt like thin women as much as women think.
 More likely men who like chubby women are the most common.
 And, vice-versaΓÇªIΓÇÖd say.
 I bet sheΓÇÖd be twice as popular
 if she were to gain a little more weight instead of dieting.
 You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.
 And youΓÇÖre smart, too.
 Hmm?
 I know it in my heartΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre much more awesome than the likes of Sasuke or Neji.
 Well, IΓÇÖve never even thought about that. IΓÇÖm me, soΓÇª
 But youΓÇÖre the only one who became a Chunin
 in the Chunin Exam this timeΓÇª
 But you might be better at fighting, right?
 I mightΓÇÖve given up if IΓÇÖd gotten into one with you.
 But earlier, Sensei told me that all I do is eat
 and that IΓÇÖm not progressingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm me, I tell you. And youΓÇÖre you.

 Hmm?
 What?
 Good luck with your training.
 Yeah.
 YouΓÇÖre a good guyΓÇªChoji.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto!
 The time is rightΓÇª
 Head for the Leaf Village, now!
 I seeΓÇª YouΓÇÖve made up your mind, huh?
 Yes!
 IΓÇÖm carrying out fitness training to get ready for the surgery.
 I want to return as soon as I can after the surgery, soΓÇª
 Oww!
 Ow-owΓÇª
 LeeΓÇª
 Yes?! What is it?
 You wonΓÇÖt die if you give up being a Shinobi.
 Why are you so fixated on being a Shinobi?
 My everything is proving that even I can become a fine NinjaΓÇª
 You might die. Even if you succeedΓÇª
 Even soΓÇª
 I promise you!
 ThatΓÇÖs my dream, soΓÇª
 WhyΓÇªdo you snap this much at the mention of HokageΓÇÖs name?
 Unlike youΓÇª
 I will be the heir to the name of Hokage, no matter what!
 Because, Hokage is my dream!
 In this village, promising children are being brought up.
 Sarutobi SenseiΓÇª Sure enough, you were a wonderful Hokage.
 The surgery is in the afternoon. Get ready!
 LetΓÇÖs go, Lee! Are you prepared?!
 Yes!
 I got some applesΓÇª You like them, right?
 Here, doesnΓÇÖt it look good?
 HuhΓÇª? I wonder where I put the knifeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs right in front of you, believe it.
 ItΓÇÖs so lame, you getting all scatterbrained just because youΓÇÖre in front of Sasuke.

 SasukeΓÇª Thank you.
 You rescued me from the Sand Ninja, right?
 No...
 The person who rescued youΓÇª was Naruto.
 You are weak.
 Why are you weakΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs because you donΓÇÖt have enoughΓÇª
 ...hate.
 Good. I peeled it nicely.
 IΓÇÖll cut it to make it easy to eat, andΓÇª
 Here, Sasuke.
 Ow! What happened?
 S-Sasuke?
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 Wh-What?
 Y-You donΓÇÖt have to glare at me like that.
 Hey, NarutoΓÇª
 Wh-What is it?
 Fight meΓÇª Right now!
 What?! Here you are, just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 Just fight!
 SasukeΓÇª
 You think you saved me?
 I donΓÇÖt care if sheΓÇÖs the Fifth Hokage or whatever, butΓÇª
 she shouldΓÇÖve just minded her own business!
 What?!
 You said you wanted to fight me, right?
 IΓÇÖm saying letΓÇÖs do it now!
 Or have you chickened out?
 S-Sasuke. HeyΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 Naruto, you say something too!
 WhatΓÇÖs this all of a sudden?
 This is perfect, believe it!
 I was just thinking I wanted to fight you!
 S-Stop it, the both of youΓÇª Okay?
 Come with me!
 WhatΓÇÖsΓÇªthis feeling? My lower belly feels tightΓÇª
 I want to fight you, too.
 AndΓÇª I feel a thrill.
 WhatΓÇÖs so funny?
 NothingΓÇÖs funny, believe it! IΓÇÖm happy!
 When I think I can finally beat you here!
 Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priority of our organization, Akatsuki.
 What did you say? DonΓÇÖt talk foolish, you failure!
 IΓÇÖm not going to be a failure forever!
 Right now, I have no interest in youΓÇª
 YouΓÇª A loser like you better not act all high and mighty!
 Hah! ItΓÇÖs unlike you to lose your cool and raise a fuss.
 So uncharacteristic.
 It couldnΓÇÖt be that you picked a fight and then got scared, could it, Sasuke?
 Just bring it, now!
 Put on your headband before that! IΓÇÖll wait.
 I donΓÇÖt need such a thingΓÇª
 Just do it!
 You wouldnΓÇÖt even be ableΓÇª to put one knick on my forehead!
 YouΓÇÖre wrong!
 IΓÇÖm saying this is a testament to fighting on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!
 And IΓÇÖm saying stuff like that is acting high and mighty!
 Do you think that weΓÇÖre equal?!
 Yeah, I do! IΓÇÖve never once thought that IΓÇÖm inferior to you!
 YouΓÇÖre an eyesore!
 ThatΓÇÖs because you remain weak! Little Sasuke!

 So whatΓÇÖs up, Temari?
 HeΓÇÖs close. HeΓÇÖs just right there.
 Dang it! What should we do?
 Leave it to me.
 That was close.
 What was that noise?
 An explosionΓÇª Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.
 I wonder if heΓÇÖs okay.
 DonΓÇÖt worryΓÇª He wouldnΓÇÖt get bumped off so easily.
 I sure hope so.
 Now then, shall we get started?
 Before that, I must have you both return to your original forms.
 Please prepare yourself, Sarutobi Sensei.
 An Unrivaled Match: Hokage Battle Royale!
 With every moment, they are looking more livelyΓÇª
 What is thatΓÇªJutsu?
 Reanimation.
 ItΓÇÖs a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu that can bring the dead back to this world.
 The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu is that it uses the blood of the caster.
 But IΓÇÖve heard that with this Jutsu,
 in order to summon a dead soul to this worldΓÇª
 the body of a living person is sacrificed as a container for the soul.
 Then, the bodies of those two are of the sacrificedΓÇª
 RightΓÇª
 Perhaps dust and dirt cover the sacrificial body
 and take on the original form of the summoned soul.
 And by way of the charm embedded in the head,
 the personality of the soul is killed
 and it morphs into no more than a killing puppet.
 TheyΓÇÖre complete.
 They look like how they used to look more than ever.
 Do you know the joy and sense of accomplishment
 of hurting one whom you once called Sensei?
 I prepared this scenario so that you might know that joy.
 So please enjoy it.
 Lord Hokage!
 Even if the shape and form are the sameΓÇª
 theyΓÇÖre neither the First Hokage nor the Second!
 IΓÇªknow!
 Here I go!
 Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.
 Water Style: Water Wall.
 No way!
 To be able to set into motion that level of Water Style in a place with no water.
 I canΓÇÖt believe it.
 True to the title of the previous Hokage.
 Water Style: Water Shock Wave!
 Earth Style: Mud Wall.
 Same mighty strength as always.
 Having two of you is quite a challenge, as might be expectedΓÇª
 This is bad.
 This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.
 Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:
 Deep Forest Emergence.
 His Chakra became a source for life.
 WowΓÇª So this is the legendary Wood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage
 who brought turbulent times under control and built the Leaf Village.

 Okay. EveryoneΓÇÖs here, right?
 Okay everyone, letΓÇÖs evacuate quickly.

 Take care of him. DonΓÇÖt let him transform into that!
 OkayΓÇª Got it!
 Transform!
 All right.
 WowΓÇª What level of Ninjutsu battle!
 This is Hokage level!
 Oh wellΓÇª Things have finally gotten interesting.
 That's one of his Snake Swords.
 LetΓÇÖs do it, Enma!
 No matter how strong the body, the Snake Sword still hurts.
 YouΓÇÖre mine!
 Lord Hokage!
 So foolishΓÇª
 To think youΓÇÖd strike without even using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it.
 It's not that he didn't use it. He canΓÇÖt use it.
 The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage has differs from the past.
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu that evenly disperses Chakra,
 if things go wrong, would be like throwing away Chakra.
 Sure enough, is it age?!
 Are you okay, Sensei?
 Please hang in there.

 NowΓÇÖs the time to draw the line.

 This is the end.
 IΓÇÖll snap your neck.

 It looks like thereΓÇÖs no point if I donΓÇÖt do something about the soul itself

 If so, all I can do is to useΓÇª the Fourth HokageΓÇÖs Jutsu.

 Instead of just getting Rokusuke and Karashi back,
 letΓÇÖs finish the Kurosuki Family once and for all!
 DonΓÇÖt get carried away, Naruto.
 So, what are we gonna do then?
 IΓÇÖm kind of worried about what Guy Sensei told us.
 The boss of the Kurosuki Family may be
 one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 Who knows what theyΓÇÖll do to Rokusuke?
 Yeah, but how seriously can we take Guy SenseiΓÇÖs info?
 What are you talking about?! Guy Sensei is always right!
 Calm down, Lee. We should investigate first.
 Yeah!
 Sir Raiga, we were able to capture Rokusuke,
 one of the three that slipped out of the village.
 Well done.
 It seems that they went to ask for some help from a Ninja village.
 Where did you go?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 DonΓÇÖt bother, rookie.
 Yes sir!
 Rokusuke, I thought we had a good relationship
 with everybody in the Gold Mine.
 Well, thatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Why is it? IΓÇÖm so deeply sorry to hear that you left the village.
 I canΓÇÖt remember how things were in the past,
 when everything was going well.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, IΓÇÖm sorry. I wonΓÇÖt do it again!
 Yeah, I have a good idea.
 IΓÇÖm going to arrange for your funeral.
 Please donΓÇÖt! Please let me go!
 I wonΓÇÖt do it again, so please forgive me!
 Why? DonΓÇÖt you like funerals?
 No, I donΓÇÖt wanna die yet!
 You know, I really like funeralsΓÇª
 Think about it.
 When they are alive, humans speak ill of each other,
 they betray each other, and they hate each other.
 But at a funeral,
 they forget all the hatred they had for the other.
 They even remember the good times they had together.
 Right?
 You have to be kidding me! No! Please donΓÇÖt do it.
 Hey!
 Let me go!
 ItΓÇÖs a done deal then. LetΓÇÖs have a big funeral for Rokusuke.
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 Come on!
 Hurry up!
 Is that gold? ThereΓÇÖs nothing shiny about it.
 They have to melt that ore into mercury.
 After that they evaporate it and only then does it turn into pure gold.
 I donΓÇÖt get it.
 Well, there is no need for you to understand it.
 Oh!
 Huh? What are you doing?! Hurry up!
 If you donΓÇÖt hurry up,
 IΓÇÖm gonna ask the boss to let me hold your funeral!
 Please forgive me!
 IΓÇÖm getting really mad now. I won't forgive them!
 Calm down, NarutoΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt know anything about them yet.
 ThatΓÇÖs right. We should do what Neji is telling us.

 Hey, hey. Hurry up and pick them up!
 Yeah! Way to go, Lee!

 Oh my gosh! What have you done?!
 Here. Drink some water.
 What are you doing?!

 arranges a funeral for those who betray him.

 What? They bury them alive? ThatΓÇÖs so cruel!

 Raiga always cries sadly during the funeral.
 ThatΓÇÖs one weird guy.
 ButΓÇª
 That doesnΓÇÖt seem to be the sound of the bell for you.

 What?!

 YeahΓÇª When I told him we were taking over the mountain from the magistrate,
 he was so relieved to be freed from the high taxes that he was paying.
 He was laughing out of pure joyΓÇª He was a really nice guy.
 I like funerals. Makes me feel nostalgic.
 Would you put on a big funeral for me too?

 OopsΓÇª

 Karashi, did you know that
 Grandma Sansho worries about you everyday while cooking curry?
 Naruto, leave things to me here.
 Karashi, you saved my life with your curry of life.
 If you can make such a wonderful curry,
 how can you stay with the family of a man with no respect for life?!
 Why?
 Nobody cares to compliment me even if I can make that curry.
 As a man born in this world,
 I should gain more power and try to take over the world!
 Instead of sitting around in that store that no one patronizes anymore.
 What? I canΓÇÖt take this anymore!
 Lee!
 Karashi, not only did you and Grandma SanshoΓÇÖs curry save my lifeΓÇª
 But you also taught me that if you make it from the heart,
 just one serving of curry could save lives,
 and that even somebody like me could do anything just by trying hard.
 You looked much stronger and dignified then than you do now.
 Karashi!
 IΓÇÖve never seen anybody who tries this hard.
 I see. You want to save this boy too, huhΓÇª
 Please promise meΓÇª Please get out of the Kurosuki Family!
 You're rightΓÇª

 One of them can see through the Chakra Network.
 He probably has some sort of Kekkei Genkai power.

 So, what are you going to do?
 Everybody in the Katabami Gold Mine is depending on me.

 For the sake of that dream I will completely become a Shinobi,
 and kill you guys!
 Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters
 Sasuke! Naruto! Don't lose to a guy like that!
 Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!
 What?
 Even if there was a chance that we could break that technique,
 they won't be able to defeat that boy.
 W-What do you mean?
 They don't have the mentality to kill their feelingsΓÇª
 and kill another person!
 That boy really knows the agony of being a Shinobi.
 He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.
 ExactlyΓÇª
 No real Shinobi will come out of a peace-addicted village like yours.
 Because they are not able to learn
 the most important ""experience of killing""!
 ThenΓÇª
 ThenΓÇª
 What are we going to do, Sensei?!
 If I go over to Naruto and Sasuke,
 Tazuna will be in danger.
 Even if I try the Shadow Clones.
 He'll come to stop me with his Water Clones.
 I'll just be wasting Chakra.
 Then...
 I'm sorry but...
 I'm going to have to finish this in an instant.
 Sharingan?!
 The Sharingan again?
 Such an unimaginative guy!
 Sensei!
 You might call me ""an unimaginative guy,""
 but you are afraid of the Sharingan, after all... Zabuza!
 The secret technique of a ShinobiΓÇª
 isn't something that you show your opponent so many times.
 Be appreciative.
 You're the only who has had the chance to see it twiceΓÇª
 And there will be no third timeΓÇª
 Even if you were able to defeat me, you can't defeat HakuΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª?
 Kakashi Sensei can't win?
 That boy in the mask is that strong?
 Since he was a kid, I have been painstakingly teaching him
 the battle techniques of the Ninja!
 All of my techniques.
 On top of thatΓÇª
 he has been polishing up his own skills as well!
 As a result...
 He has...
 no matter how unbelievably difficult his predicament,
 been extremely successful.
 He has no ""heart"" and has abandoned the notion of ""life.""
 He is a fighting machine known as a Shinobi.
 Not only that, his Jutsu surpasses mine!
 The terrifying ability of the Kekkei Genkai.
 In other words, I have acquired a sophisticated tool.
 Unlike the scrap you're carrying around.
 I'm not one to be afraid just because I failed once!
 I'll do it as many times as it takes!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Stop!
 W-What the hell is itΓÇª?!
 I-It was just slight butΓÇª
 I could see the trails of his movementsΓÇª
 One more try!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't you understand that it's useless?
 Just because I see the trail,
 doesn't mean that I can keep up with his speed.
 The waterΓÇª is being repelled.
 But, what if that wasn't waterΓÇª?
 All rightΓÇª
 The next one is going to be my one shot!
 Just because a bunch of scrap got together
 doesn't mean that they can defeat Haku.
 He isΓÇª. He is the best tool!
 There's nothing boring than a stranger braggingΓÇª
 It's about timeΓÇª I make my move.
 Now wait. As long as we're talkingΓÇª
 Let me brag about another thingΓÇª
 Hmm?
 In the battle before,
 I didn't just let you defeat me like a fool.
 It's overΓÇª
 Haku, who was hiding in the corner,
 was observing part of the battle.
 Haku is quite smart.
 With his ability to analyze,
 he is able to plan a counterattack after observing a technique just once.
 I've been anxious to copy your line.
 ""I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.""
 Was that itΓÇª?
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 This is...?!
 What is thisΓÇª? This really thick fog?
 The visibility is close to zero...
 SenseiΓÇª!
 Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!
 That's right.
 I have to trust Sasuke, Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right nowΓÇª
 And I should do what I can do!
 Huh?
 Oh! Sakura!
 Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,  don't move away from me!
 YeahΓÇª I soo know it!
 I knowΓÇª 					ZabuzaΓÇª
 I'll finish them off soon enoughΓÇª
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You just don't learn, do you?!
 What? The Fire Style Jutsu!
 It takesΓÇªtoo long!
 This is good!
 Bit by bit, I'm figuring out the timing...
 I know it's called Hidden Mist, but the fog is way too thickΓÇª
 Even Zabuza himself shouldn't be able to see anything...
 Good job on dodging itΓÇª
 Just what I expect of Kakashi of the Sharingan...
 He'sΓÇª.
 closing his eyes!
 ButΓÇªthe next time you see me,
 that'll be the end of it allΓÇª
 You overrate the Sharingan too much.
 WhatΓÇª?
 You spoke as if you saw through everything, butΓÇª
 Why?
 Could it be possible that you can see the futureΓÇª?!
 You are going to die.
 Your foresight was wrong, after all.
 Kakashi...
 You can't read my mind or my future...
 The Sharingan is merely a diversion that makes you believe that!
 Those who have the Sharingan...
 possess both perceptive eyes and hypnotic eyesΓÇª
 Using these two powers and bringing out Jutsus one after the other..
 you were just acting as if you can read the future!
 First with the perceptive eyes, you copied my movement right away.
 And this is the Image Replication Method.
 You first got me in a ruffle with itΓÇª
 Once you make sure that I'm flustered,
 you nail the ""heart's voice.""
 ΓÇô This is the Mind Imitation Method. ΓÇô It's only an imitation, after all.
 ΓÇô You can't defeat me! You monkey! ΓÇô You can't defeat me! You monkey!
 That imitating monkey mouth...
 I'll make sure that you won't be able to open it any more!
 AndΓÇª
 You judged the right timing when my frustration was reaching its height
 W-What is that?
 You set a clever trap.
 Me...?
 You used the Genjutsu with your hypnotic eye and
 made me weave the signs first...
 This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...
 The Giant Vortex Jutsu!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Then that makes it easier.
 First vanish into the thick fog,
 and make your perceptive eyes uselessΓÇª.
 Huh?
 Darn! The guard is falling behind!
 I will close my eyes as well!
 I will shut off your ability to use your hypnotic eye
 in a close-distance battle.
 Why?
 That also means that you will lose your ability to see.
 Did you forget...?
 That I am a genius in Silent Killing,
 a technique to find the target just by sound.
 He read my movement... No way could he do that.
 Darn! We were so close!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spentΓÇª and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him, I found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah!  Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 What?
 Run out of here and attack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able to...!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limit to that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that, he's little by littleΓÇª
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while since I've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calmΓÇª Think... What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 Why? Why is it?
 Why did this happen?
 I never asked for your help! I hated you!
 But youΓÇª
 Darn! I won't forgive you!

4,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 He's late.
 Naruto!
 Stay still.
 Why's it that only our squad's teacher is late?
 The other squads have gone off somewhere with their new teachers,
 and Iruka Sensei's also left.
 Don't look at me.
 Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?!
 Hey!
 It'll be his fault because he's late.
 Man! You're asking for it!
 I like stuff like this!
 A Jonin wouldn't get caught in such a weak booby trap.
 That's right. You're such an idiot...!
 I got him, I got him...
 I-I'm sorry, sir.
 I tried to stop him, but Naruto did it on his own...
 It's all good.
 Get real. ls he really a Jonin?
 How can I put this?
 As for my first impression of you guys...?
 Well, I hate you.
 Pass or Fail: Survival Test
 Let's see.
 First off, let me have you guys introduce yourselves.
 Introduce ourselves...
 What should we say?
 Your likes, dislikes, your future dream, hobbies, things like that!
 Hey!  Before that, please tell us about yourself.
 Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.
 I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes.
 I've never really thought about my future dream...
 As for my hobbies, I have many.
 In the end, isn't all we know his name?
 Yeah.
 Next is you guys.
 Let's start with you.
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
 I like instant ramen,
 but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku
 that Iruka Sensei treats me to.
 What I dislike is the three minutes
 after pouring hot water in the instant ramen.
 My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!
 And my future dream...
 is to surpass the Hokage!
 And so I'm going to get the entire village
 to acknowledge my existence!
 I see...
 this kid's grown up in an interesting way.
 Okay, next.
 I'm Sakura Haruno.
 What I like... I mean, who I like is...
 And, my hobby is, 					I mean...
 My future dream is...
 And? What about your dislikes?
 Naruto!
 Girls at her age are probably more interested in love
 than the Ninja Arts.
 And lastly.
 My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.
 I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.
 Oh...
 And...
 I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream
 but I do have an ambition!
 The ambition to restore my clan and without fail...
 to kill a certain man!
 He doesn't...
 mean me, does he?
 Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.
 I knew it...
 Good!
 The three of you are very distinctive and interesting!
 We'll have a mission tomorrow!
 Yes, sir! What kind of mission?
 First, we'll do what we can do with just four people.
 What-what-what?!
 A survival exercise.
 Survival exercise?
 Why are we doing an exercise
 even though this is supposed to be a mission?
 We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy!
 This is no simple exercise.
 Then... then what kind of exercise is it?
 Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?
 Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted.
 What?
 Of the twenty-seven graduates,
 only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas.
 The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy.
 In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test
 with a failure rate of 66% or higher!
 See, see?
 You got disenchanted!
 That's crazy!
 To have suffered that much!
 T-Then, what was the graduation test for?
 Oh, that.
 It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin.
 Whaaaat?!
 Well, that's the way it is.
 I'll be determining whether you pass or fail.
 Bring your complete set of Ninja tools!
 We meet at five in the morning.
 N-No way am I going to be dropped now!
 I've got to have my strength recognized for real.
 I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test.
 This is an exercise of love!
 Okay! You're dismissed.
 Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.
 You'll throw up.
 Morning.
 Hi, folks. Good morning!
 You're late!
 Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see.
 Ahem! Oh well...
 Okay, it's set for 12:00!
 Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon.
 Those who can't do it won't get lunch.
 They'll be tied to that...
 and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes.
 So that was the point...
 for us not to eat breakfast...
 But, hold on.
 Why are there only two bells?
 There are only two, so at the very least,
 one will have to go to the logs.
 That person will be disqualified for failing the mission...
 and will return to the Academy.
 It might be one person at the very least,
 or it could be all three of you.
 You can use your Shuriken.
 You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me.
 But, that's dangerous, sir!
 Y-Yeah, that's right!
 You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser!
 In this world,
 those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more.
 Well, just ignore the loser...
 Begin when I give the ""ready-go"" signal.
 Loser, loser, loser.
 Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet.
 No way...!
 I didn't see him at all.
 So this is a Jonin.
 But, that's fine.
 At least you came with  the intent to kill me.
 How can I put this...?
 I feel like I'm finally starting...
 to like you guys.
 We're going to start.
 Ready... start!
 What do you want to know?
 I didn't think you just came here to drink tea.
 The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven...
 What kind of teacher is he? ls he strict?
 You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you?
 I heard a rumor that concerns me.
 What's this?
 It's a pass-fail list of the junior ninjas
 Kakashi has been in charge of up until now.
 Let me have a look.
 T-This is...!
 Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide.
 Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...
 Alright! Let's face off fair and square!
 Oh?
 That goof.
 Say, aren't you a bit off kilter?
 What's off kilter is your hairstyle!
 I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu...
 Taijutsu.
 Taijutsu...?
 That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...
 That being said... he's going to use weapons?
 Make-Out Paradise
 What's the matter?
 Why don't you come at me?
 But hey... what's with the book?
 Why do you ask...?
 It's because I was curious about what happens next.
 Don't worry.
 With you guys as opponents,
 it makes no difference if I'm reading or not.
 I'm going to rip you apart!
 Darn! This time a spin kick!
 Man!
 Wha--?!
 Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool.
 The way his hands are positioned...
 Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!
 No way!
 With Naruto as his opponent,
 that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it.
 That Sign... lt's a fire-style skill.
 That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around?
 Naruto, get out of there quick!
 You'll die!
 Too late.
 Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu!
 One Thousand Years of Death!
 Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.
 Those two are idiots.
 Alright...
 Even so, isn't that against the rules?
 What're we supposed to do about his strength?
 Darn it!
 It wasn't supposed to be like this.
 It... can't be!
 This is more than just a rumor.
 Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult...
 Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed...!
 That's right...
 Kakashi has never had someone pass.
 They have all...
 been annihilated...
 What's the matter?
 You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon.
 I know that, I say.
 You're not very energetic,
 considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage.
 Darn it! Darn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry.
 I didn't even have dinner last night.
 I shouldn't have gone on a diet.
 I just got a bit careless earlier!
 Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...
 But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what.
 No matter what...
 I'm... not...
 turning back now!
 I'm going to become a Ninja!
 Security is your greatest enemy!
 Now for my favorite Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Seven... Narutos?
 What? They're not just images?
 Are they all real? The real thing?
 Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!
 Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Those aren't just images but actual clones!
 That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki.
 Judging from your ability,
 that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit.
 Even if you talk trash,
 Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done...
 You still can't beat me with that skill.
 W-What?! Behind me?!
 Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind.
 Right, Kakashi Sensei?
 Using the Shadow Clone,
 I had one of them come up
 from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you!
 Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier!
 Naruto, not bad!
 So... a diversionary tactic, eh?
 Now... allow me to punch you!
 What?!
 The one who got punched was...
 Naruto?
 Ouch!
 You...!
 You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!
 You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?!
 It's you!
 You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.
 You smell like Kakashi Sensei!
 The smell of an old guy!
 Why you--!
 Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu.
 If we do that, only the two will remain... so...
 You should've realized that sooner, you idiot!
 You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu!
 Naruto...
 You're embarrassing to watch...
 That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool.
 Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body
 with an object or animal.
 This makes your enemy think you're being attacked,
 but then you strike during their unguarded moment.
 After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto,
 the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos.
 Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed...
 he used Naruto's own attack on him.
 A bell?!
 You really must have been in a hurry.
 You've dropped a bell!
 What the heck is this?!
 Of course it's a trap...
 H-H-Hey!
 That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto.
 The bell!
 You have to think when using Jutsu.
 They can be used against you.
 Also...
 ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.
 A Ninja must see through deception!
 I know that, I say!
 You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it.
 Listen up!
 Your movements are wasteful.
 Now!
 He finally dropped his guard!
 You're so...
 No way!
 You jerk Sasuke!
 You're overdoing it!
 Darn it!
 At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei.
 But if I don't take the bell...
 I won't get lunch...
 No... I'll fail the test!
 He says a Ninja must see through deception,
 but I have no idea what that means.
 How in the world can I take the bell back
 from Kakashi Sensei?!

 Rockin' my heart
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 You, from Hidden Sound Village!
 No doing as you please before the Exam!
 You want to be failed at the get go?!
 Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams, so we flipped out... despite ourselves.
 Hmph. This is a good opportunity,  so I'll say this.
 There will be no battles, competitions and the like
 without the permission of the proctors!
 And even if you get permission,
 actions that could lead to the death of an opponent will not be permitted.
 Any pig that screws with me will be disqualified immediately.
 Got it?!
 This Exam looks to be easy!
 Now then, we will start the first test of the Chunin Exam!
 Turn in your applications,
 take one of these number cards in exchange,
 and sit in the seat matching that number!
 After that, we will hand out the paper for the written test!
 Written...? Paper...?
 Paper...
 A paper test?!
 Start Your Engines: The Chunin Exam Begins!
 Everyone's seats are all scattered... What should I do?
 He's deflated, deflated...
 It's the worst type of test for Naruto...
 Naruto...
 Oh! You are Hinata...! Since when have you...?
 L-Let's both do our best.
 Y-Yeah.
 I didn't notice her at all.
 Hinata has no presence at all...
 There are several important rules to this first test.
 I will take no questions, so listen well accordingly!
 Rules? No questions will be taken...?
 First off is the first rule!
 You are given ten points each from the start!
 The written test has ten problems in all!
 Each problem is one point.
 And, this test is a point deduction system.
 You are deducted one point for each problem you get wrong!
 If you get three wrong, you'll have seven points!
 If I get ten wrong, I'll have zero points...
 The second rule.
 Pass or failure will be determined
 by the total points of the three-person teams.
 W-Wait a minute!
 What do you mean... total points of the teams?
 Shut up!
 There's a perfectly good reason for this!
 Shut up and listen!
 Reason...?
 If you've got it, here is the most important next rule!
 Those who are deemed by the sentinels
 as having committed an act of cheating or something similar to that...
 will have two points deducted  for each act.
 What...?
 Oh!
 In other words...
 there may be those who will be dismissed during this test
 without waiting for test grading.
 This means they're deducting points
 from things other than the written test problems.
 Know that those who commit awkward cheating...
 will bring ruin upon yourselves.
 I'll check you anytime.
 If you aspire to become a Chunin at all,
 know that Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
 Relax...! 					Yes... yes!
 Naruto aside, Sasuke and I are okay!
 Even if Naruto gets zero points... if we cover that...
 And, in the case of even one person on the team getting zero points...
 Everyone on that team will fail!
 Wha--?!
 What did he say...?!
 I feel two menacing stares...
 Naruto?
 By the way, the last problem will be given forty-five minutes
 after the start of the test!
 The time for the test is one hour.
 Begin!
 Could it...
 Could it be that, the fat is really on the fire now...?
 Naruto...! Just don't get zero points!
 Naruto isn't getting jitters from the get go, is he...?
 This is bad...
 As if!
 I know I've cleared many obstacles like this before...
 At times like this, one should look at all the problems
 without feeling pressed or making a fuss!
 And then with utmost effort
 I should tackle the problems that look easy to understand!
 Let's see, the first problem... is a code text, eh...
 Excellent, I say!
 Next! Next!
 Let's see... the second problem...
 The parabola B in the diagram illustrates the greatest possible distance
 Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shuriken from a tree seven meters high...
 Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja's character inferred
 from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,
 also answer the longest firing range in battle on flat ground
 and explain your basis.
 T-This is an... integrated problem based on predictions
 of uncertain conditions and dynamic energy analysis application...!
 There's no way Naruto can solve this!
 I mean...
 hardly anyone except me can solve this problem!
 Okay, next! 					Next!
 These other problems... are nothing but difficult ones.
 I see...
 I don't... understand even one of these problems.
 Oh, no, this is bad!
 For real! For real!
 What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
 If about ten of all fifty-one teams are able to pass,
 it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself and get a considerable amount of points.
 It's like a system inviting cheating...
 I hope Sasuke and Naruto won't panic and cheat.
 It's okay... Naruto's not that much of an idiot...
 I know that...
 Don't panic...
 For now, all there is to do is to be very, very cautious...
 and cheat without being found out!
 No! No! I can't, that's no good, no good!
 I can't tread on such thin ice!
 At any rate, this elaborate fuss...
 It's like a trick assuming that we're going to cheat.
 They probably check with that paper...
 Somebody got nailed.
 Cheating deducts two points.
 Two-point deduction, huh...
 Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment the cheating was discovered...
 Know that those who commit awkward cheating
 will bring ruin upon themselves.
 Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
 I see, so that's how it is, eh.
 This wasn't just an achievement test!
 The real aim was...
 a test to see the ability for intensive information collection
 with the full use of deception and concealment techniques.
 ""Shinobi should read  the double bluff,"" eh...
 In other words, the true intention of the proctor is...
 if you're going to cheat, not ""awkward cheating,""
 but ""like exemplary Shinobi"", don't get caught.
 Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness of the point deduction system,
 the lenience of only deducting two points for each discovery of cheating makes sense.
 In other words,
 what's being tested here is how we can gather the correct answers
 without having our cheating detected by the proctors or
 by the one being cheated on.
 Realize it quick, Naruto!
 It'll turn into a fatal mistake!
 Realize it!
 This is bad. Believe it...
 If the purpose of this test is seeing the ability to gather information...
 then there should be someone in this classroom somewhere...
 who knows the answers to the problems!
 So Gaara has also started, eh...
 Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow.
 Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru! Next is problem four!
 Judging from this rhythm...
 The stroke order... and the number of strokes...
 I see.
 Okay! Please tell me.
 Eight, huh.
 Lee, if you can see it, wear your headband!
 Time is rapidly going by!
 Oh, man! I'm afraid all there is to do is cheat...
 But, if I'm discovered,
 it'll be trouble for Sakura and Sasuke.
 On the other hand, if I get zero points...
 Sakura and Sasuke will be my companions in failure.
 Naruto...
 I'll show you... my test.
 Huh...?
 What is Hinata saying...?
 W-Why would she do such a thing for me?
 Could it be... some kind of trickery?
 But Hinata is not one to do something like that...
 No... But she might've been coaxed into attempting to trap me by Kiba and others...
 Hinata, let me ask you one thing!
 Huh?!
 Why would you show me?
 Uh... uh... actually...
 I...I...
 I don't want you, Naruto... to leave at this stage...
 Y-You see... the nine of us are the only rookies...
 and I have many anxieties about what's to come, so!
 I get it now! I was kind of strangely suspicious of you!
 Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!
 Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...
 W-What was that? I was about to turn...
 W-What was that for, sir?!
 You made five mistakes. You fail!
 N-No way...
 His two buddies, both of you get out of the classroom, right now.
 ΓÖ¬ 23 fails!
 ΓÖ¬ 43 and ΓÖ¬27 fail!
 Noooo!
 Hey, hey! Do you have proof that I cheated five whole times?!
 Really, are you guys properly checking this number of people...?
 Listen up...
 Even among us Chunin, we're elite who were selected for this Exam.
 We don't overlook you blinking once...
 In a matter of speaking, this strength is the proof.
 Naruto...?
 Hurry... Look...
 Hinata... You don't get it, do you?
 What...?
 An awesome ninja like me won't cheat. Believe it!
 N-Naruto.
 B-But...
 Also, if something went wrong,
 you'd be in a hot spot for helping me cheat, right?!
 \What?!
 Naruto...
 I'm... sorry... I-I did something uncalled for...
 Nah, it's okay.
 I...went and acted big.
 What should I do? I'm extremely stupid.
 Byakugan!
 Sharingan!
 I'll copy all his movements!
 My hand is moving fluently...
 I hit the jackpot straight away with this guy.
 Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh.
 I'm acknowledging that your smarts
 and the width of your forehead are exceptional.
 So you should thank me.
 Thank me for getting to be the target for this Jutsu.
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 So Ino... started using that Jutsu...
 There's no countering that spell of Ino's...
 Sakura, I let myself move into your mind for just a little bit.
 I have to memorize the answers quick.
 I've got to pass these answers to Shikamaru and Choji.
 ΓÖ¬ 59! Fails!
 ΓÖ¬ 33! ΓÖ¬9!
 This is the thirteenth group to fail.
 ΓÖ¬ 41 fails.
 ΓÖ¬ 35, ΓÖ¬62 fails!
 No way!
 That brat...
 He coolly proceeds through this ruckus without moving an eyelash.
 Very well done considering he's new.
 The optic nerves are connected...
 The third eye... open!
 Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...
 Dang it...!
 Excuse me.
 What is it?
 I need to go to the bathroom...
 We will accompany you to the bathroom.
 I see...
 Anyhow... the proctors are nothing so special!
 They don't realize that the proctors have increased by one...
 Eh, don't you think so...
 Crow...?
 Forty minutes have passed since the test started...
 Twenty minutes left... huh...
 Since it's come to this,
 it's the last problem to be given forty-five minutes after the start of the test.
 All there is to do is bet on this. Believe it!
 Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for life once I get it wrong?!
 Really? Really? Really?
 If I don't take it, I'll fail with my comrades immediately?
 No way, no way, no way.
 The hopeless rule for problem ten!
 Not good, not good, not good.
 No way can I choose which one!
 What to do, do, do, do.
 This is seriously, seriously bad!
 Bad, bad, bad, bad.

 WhyΓÇª

 Here! Good one!
 Good! Go! Go! Go!

 We donΓÇÖt know any wall-climbing techniques or anythingΓÇª
 Y-YouΓÇÖreΓÇª
 ThisΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs GaaraΓÇª
 Gaara of SandΓÇª
 R-Run!
 Wait!
 DonΓÇÖt leave me alone!
 Help me!
 I don'tΓÇª
 want to be alone anymore!
 ReallyΓÇª
 No!
 Gaara! Please calm down!
 YashamaruΓÇª
 No escape!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you escape! Sasuke Uchiha!
 YouΓÇÖve gotta be kidding! WhatΓÇÖs with that outrageous strengthΓÇª?
 Are you afraid of me?
 ItΓÇÖs too overwhelmingΓÇª
 Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid? Are you afraid of my existence?!
 DonΓÇÖt forgetΓÇª You are my prey.
 Wait!
 Why are you fixated on me so much?
 Those eyes that know true lonelinessΓÇª
 And eyes that know that it is the worldΓÇÖs greatest sufferingΓÇª
 I think I told you.
 That you have the same eyes as me.
 Eyes that lust for power,
 overflowing with hatred and murderous intentΓÇª
 The same as meΓÇª
 Eyes that burn to kill those who drove youΓÇª
 into a hell called loneliness!
 Such are your eyes.
 Okay. Just a minute.
 So youΓÇÖre called GaaraΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know what you know about Sasuke, butΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not good for you to speak as though
 you perceive everything about Sasuke!
 What is it that you want to say to him before the final round,
 by pursuing him so far?
 A battle is whereΓÇª
 anotherΓÇÖs existence and oneΓÇÖs own existence are put on the lineΓÇª
 and each tries to kill the other!
 Only the winner can actually feel the value of his own existence.
 In other words, what you want to say isΓÇª
 letΓÇÖs have a killing bout and not a match?
 UchihaΓÇª You really should be wanting it, tooΓÇª
 in the depths of your soulΓÇª
 You want to confirm the value of your existence.
 Am I really, truly powerful?
 Is my existence more powerful than my opponent
 who faces me with eyes filled with intent to kill?
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?!
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 Are you afraid of me?!
 Your hatred and intent to killΓÇª
 have they given way to fear?
 Is that the extent of your existence?!
 Fight meΓÇªand confirm it!
 Your value! Your existence!
 Experience it!
 If you want an answerΓÇª
 Come at me!
 I was allowed to liveΓÇª
 OnlyΓÇªmyself.
 Expressly for what reason?!
 NoΓÇª I know the reason.
 The reason that man left me alive was so he wouldnΓÇÖt be tormented
 by a sense of guilt for having killed an entire clanΓÇª
 Itachi chose me as the avengerΓÇª in order to have me kill him!
 Now, let me have some funΓÇª Sasuke Uchiha!
 IΓÇÖll finish it with one blow!
 Hurry up and die, release yourself from your misery.
 You silly old foolΓÇª
 I believe I told youΓÇª that you would die too!
 Bastard!
 Let go, you old fool!
 I will not let go! I refuse to let goΓÇª
 until I have pulled out your soul!
 At this rateΓÇª
 Gaara!
 Looks like it workedΓÇª
 I see! ThatΓÇÖs what it was!
 ThatΓÇÖs not possibleΓÇª
 He countered GaaraΓÇÖs attack in that condition?!
 I just realized the reasonΓÇª why itΓÇÖs so fun!
 This painΓÇª
 To take down an opponent who wounded meΓÇª
 and thoroughly destroy himΓÇª!
 That will make me truly feel alive!
 GaaraΓÇÖs never had a single wound, but he got Gaara twice.
 Is heΓÇªa freak?!
 NoΓÇªa true freak isΓÇª
 After all, the only thing Gaara is transforming is still just his right arm.
 More, more!
 What?!
 What the heck is this guy?!
 One after anotherΓÇª
 Here goes!
 HeΓÇÖs even faster!
 I canΓÇÖt dodge unless I read ahead of his movements.
 If I didnΓÇÖt have these eyes IΓÇÖd have died long ago.
 I can no longer use ChidoriΓÇª
 Fire StyleΓÇª Fire Ball Jutsu!
 So the Fire Style doesnΓÇÖt work against sandΓÇª
 Not only that, this level of Jutsu wonΓÇÖtΓÇª
 Die!
 ApparentlyΓÇªit needs to be Chidori!
 Well! Your limit is two shots. ThatΓÇÖs about itΓÇª
 This is as many Chidori you can shoot in one day
 with your present Chakra.
 After all, this Chidori is a technique that can only be used
 in conjunction with Sharingan during actual battles.
 But using Sharingan and another Jutsu simultaneously means
 exploding and using up the Chakra in your body all at once.
 Well! But you really are one of the more impressive ones.
 Even with my ChidoriΓÇª
 If I use the Lightning Blade four times in a day,
 IΓÇÖd completely use up my Chakra.
 What would happen if I tried to use more than two shots?
 The third shot wonΓÇÖt be activatedΓÇª
 Remember this well!
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activateΓÇª
 not only will the Jutsu not properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zeroΓÇª
 And in the worst case, youΓÇÖll die!
 Even if you were to survive, absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your case.
 What's the matter?
 Does the value of your existence amount to only this much?
 IΓÇÖll be bluntΓÇª
 You areΓÇªweak!
 YouΓÇÖre too optimistic.
 And itΓÇÖs because your hatred is weak!
 The power of hatred is the power of the intent to kill!
 The power of the intent to kill is the power of revenge!
 Your hatred is weaker than mine!
 Shut upΓÇª
 Do you understand the meaning of this?!
 Shut up!
 That means that youΓÇª You are weaker than me!
 Itachi chose me to be the avengerΓÇª to have me kill him!
 I am an avenger!
 The Curse Mark againΓÇª
 DarnΓÇª! My bodyΓÇª

 Hey Yashamaru, what does pain feel like?
 I donΓÇÖt know because IΓÇÖve never been injuredΓÇª

 Multiple Traps! Countdown to Destruction
 This many Paper BombsΓÇª is a diversion?
 Y-Yes!
 No wayΓÇª
 No. HeΓÇÖs a man who would go that farΓÇª
 After all, he is Genno the Trapper!
 Remember. Think. His actions thus farΓÇª
 His intent hidden in there.
 First he steals the blueprints for key facilities in the village
 and pretends to blow himself up in front of the Anbu Black Ops.
 Because of the incident,
 an S-Level Emergency Security Alert is givenΓÇª
 The village becomes poorly mannedΓÇª
 and Genno is able to move around as he pleasesΓÇª
 Then why did he scatter the blueprints he stole?
 With this incident, it becomes evident that Genno might still be alive
 so the guys on watch outside end up returning
 to the village as quickly possibleΓÇª
 Could that have been his objective?
 He directed everyoneΓÇÖs attention to the Paper Bombs
 and reassembled the village Shinobi.
 If his aim is to set up something thereΓÇª
 Could it beΓÇª?
 The Paper Bombs in the village were a decoy?
 You canΓÇÖt see the Paper Bombs in this room?
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 WhatΓÇÖs up with these Paper Bombs?
 Do you know the geological conditions
 of the Great Stone Faces?
 G-Geological conditionsΓÇª?
 To be precise, the geological condition of this plateau
 which the Great Stone Faces are carved into.
 The plateau towering behind the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 is made of extremely hard rock.
 But this rock has narrow lines running through it, you seeΓÇª
 It can be easily broken if power is applied along those lines.
 The Great Stone Faces were created using thisΓÇª
 This time and thirty years ago
 arenΓÇÖt the only times IΓÇÖve come to the LeafΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve visited the Leaf several times and checked things outΓÇª
 And then I finally determined itΓÇª
 I determined how to set Paper Bombs to destroy this plateau!
 Wha--?!
 IΓÇÖm fairly certain no one would imagine
 the destruction of the Great Stone FacesΓÇª
 Especially when
 weΓÇÖre in the middle of Paper Bomb removal operations.
 We wouldn't even think about the Great Stone FacesΓÇª
 But if that entire plateau were to slide down and crumbleΓÇª
 The Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 would be completely buried in earth and sand!
 The Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 It would be destroyed!
 Choji, contact the Fifth Hokage immediately!
 Make sure the guys who return donΓÇÖt enter the villageΓÇª
 Shikamaru, be happy!
 Guy Sensei and the others have come back!
 Hurry, hurry! Now that Might Guy has returned,
 we wonΓÇÖt let the enemy do as he pleases!
 Too late, huhΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs the matterΓÇª?
 Shikamaru!
 Naruto hasΓÇª!
 WhyΓÇª? Why destroy the whole villageΓÇª?
 If you do that, many innocent people will die.
 And all the buildings you built will be destroyed.
 Is that what you want?!
 You may think revenge is your last job or whatever,
 but something like this is absolutely mistaken.
 If youΓÇÖre going to go through with this no matter whatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll stop you!
 ThatΓÇÖs impossible.
 No way will I let you detonate the Paper Bombs!
 Nope. I won from the moment you set foot in here.
 Even if you defeat me,
 the triggering device will activate the instant you leave this place.
 It seems everyone has returnedΓÇª
 I guess IΓÇÖll be activating the triggring deviceΓÇª
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves shall meet
 the same fate as Heat Devil Village!
 I wonΓÇÖt let that happen!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ItΓÇÖs over!
 ItΓÇÖs useless to resistΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs impossible for you alone to disarm all of my traps.
 No doubt, it might be impossible for me aloneΓÇª
 but IΓÇÖve got friends!
 But didnΓÇÖt you do nothing but badmouth them at Ichiraku?
 Yeah. I get in fights with them a lot and they tick me off sometimesΓÇª
 But theyΓÇÖre my friends!
 TheyΓÇÖre Shinobi who will protect the Leaf with me!
 No matter what traps you setΓÇª
 theyΓÇÖll manage somehow, no matter what!
 Then, IΓÇÖll finish everything before that.
 You won't be able to stop them this time!
 Fang Over FangΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖd say that was a close shave, huh?
 Kiba! Akamaru! HowΓÇÖd you know I was hereΓÇª?
 Thank Hinata!
 She thought it was strange that youΓÇÖd leave for no reason,
 so she frantically searched for you with her Byakugan.
 But the Byakugan shouldnΓÇÖt be that versatileΓÇª
 I'm surprised you found usΓÇª
 Well, we had a pretty good idea of where you wereΓÇª
 Shikamaru said that the final trap would be in the Great Stone Faces.
 Shikamaru didΓÇª?
 I seeΓÇª
 This means I shouldnΓÇÖt take young opponents lightly, huhΓÇª?
 Right. You misjudged our powerΓÇª
 Th-These areΓÇªinsects?!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª YouΓÇÖre finished now.
 Get down, you two!
 Old manΓÇª
 He blew himself up!
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it!
 ItΓÇÖs a SubstitutionΓÇª
 It seems he switched just before being covered with the insectsΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs over nowΓÇª
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs the Shadow Strangle JutsuΓÇª
 You anticipated my actionsΓÇª?
 Yup. Checkmate, old man. Come on right over hereΓÇª
 Choji, restrain him.
 Got itΓÇª
 Oh, shoot! His shadowΓÇª!
 ShikamaruΓÇª What did he doΓÇª?
 He had set it so a smoke screen would activate
 if he were touched by an enemy.
 Choji, to the right!
 Human Boulder!
 The Leaf is now finished!
 A strike?
 Why won'tΓÇª the Paper Bomb explode?
 Tough luckΓÇª
 We already disarmed that Paper Bomb.
 And we disarmed all the triggering devices
 set inside the Great Stone Faces.
 This is as far as you go old manΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª Prepare yourself!
 ItΓÇÖs useless to run!
 I donΓÇÖt know how incredible of a Trapper you are.
 But my friendsΓÇÖ teamwork is better than you are!
 I must not give up hereΓÇª
 Give up, already!
 No matter what you set up, weΓÇÖll stop it!
 I wouldnΓÇÖt be ableΓÇª to show my face to my sonΓÇª
 WhereΓÇÖd heΓÇª?
 Over there!
 It seems you havenΓÇÖt disarmed all of the triggering devicesΓÇª
 IΓÇªwin!
 The village!
 DonΓÇÖt be fooled, guys! This is a Genjutsu!
 Release!
 Naruto!
 Huh? Wh-What?
 Summoning Jutsu!
 He's planning to get on that bird and escape!
 Leave it to me!
 Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 All right! ItΓÇÖs a successΓÇª
 ΓÇô InoΓÇª! 					ΓÇô Hey!
 WhyΓÇÖd you break the Jutsu?!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 His bodyΓÇª It really hurtΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs fighting while enduring a lot of pain in his body!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you escape!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Sure enoughΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm no match for a young person at Taijutsu, huhΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs not like thatΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre a quite the practitioner of TaijutsuΓÇª
 Now itΓÇÖs finally over!
 ItΓÇÖs not over yetΓÇª
 What?
 What do you meanΓÇª itΓÇÖs not over yet?
 WhereΓÇÖs the bird he summoned earlier?
 Oh! Over there!
 There are Paper Bombs on its feet!
 What?!
 The Mountainside Image of the Third Hokage is the spot
 where I restored a crackΓÇª
 I used a device different from the othersΓÇª
 That cracked section is slightly more fragile than the other areasΓÇª
 I set an triggering device that takes advantage of thatΓÇª
 If there an explosion occurs there,
 the other Paper Bombs will explode at once.
 Going so far as to set a device in such a placeΓÇª
 To think we overlooked thatΓÇª!
 That means he summoned that bird to activate the device?!
 At lastΓÇªmy wish will come trueΓÇª
 Here it comes!
 I'll use thisΓÇª
 It dodged them!
 We canΓÇÖt bring it down with a long-range attack?!
 IΓÇÖll defend the Leaf, no matter what!
 IΓÇÖll blow him away with the Rasengan before he slams into this place!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What?!
 What?!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu! Both arms!
 Naruto, use my hands!
 Thanks, Choji!
 H-Hinata?!
 U-UmmΓÇªShikamaru told me to read that birdΓÇÖs movements
 with my Byakugan and to give you directionsΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª?
 I leave the rest to you!
 All right, letΓÇÖs go, Hinata!
 R-Right!
 Byakugan!
 Not yetΓÇª Draw it closerΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be okay.
 No matter what,
 IΓÇÖll protect the village the Third Hokage risked his life to protect!
 NarutoΓÇª Now!

 What? Did something happenΓÇª?
 All right!
 Yes! We did it, Hinata!
 N-NarutoΓÇª
 The inside of his body is in terrible shapeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs amazing that he lived until today.
 Old manΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs too badΓÇª I failed to leave my name in historyΓÇª
 ButΓÇªI hadΓÇªfunΓÇª
 What?
 What do you mean, old man?!
 What do you mean you had fun?!
 Old Man Genno!
 Naruto? 					No, itΓÇÖs notΓÇª
 ΓÇ£My son proud as a peacock having beaten me at treasure huntingΓÇªΓÇ¥
 Treasure huntingΓÇª?
 Did you noticeΓÇª?
 Huh?
 The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualty in this incidentΓÇª
 Old Man Genno! Open your eyes!
 Old Man Genno!!
 I figured it out, ShikamaruΓÇª
 It seems the person in this picture is GennoΓÇÖs real sonΓÇª
 SonΓÇª?
 It seems he became a Shinobi like his fatherΓÇª
 but lost his life right after that when the Leaf invaded Heat Devil Village.
 I bet he wanted to avenge his own sonΓÇª
 So he did something like thisΓÇª
 No doubt, at first he may have infiltrated the village for revengeΓÇª
 At firstΓÇª?
 Something was kind of bugging me,
 so I checked out the triggering device that was set in the Academy
 one more time.
 There was a loose connection in one spot.
 It was set up so it wouldnΓÇÖt activate even if the target were hitΓÇª
 WasnΓÇÖt that just GennoΓÇÖs mistakeΓÇª?
 Genno was a first-rate Trapper.
 ItΓÇÖs unlikely heΓÇÖd make such a simple mistakeΓÇª
 No doubt about itΓÇª
 The same goes for the traps in the Great Stone FacesΓÇª
 There were some defective bombs mixed in with the Paper Bombs.
 Even if the traps were activated,
 there's a strong possibility that
 they'd only make a few cracks in the Great Stone Faces.
 Then he had no serious intention of smashing the Leaf?
 ThenΓÇªfor what purposeΓÇª?
 Treasure huntingΓÇª
 What do you mean treasure hunting?
 It makes more sense to think of it like that.
 In other words, he infiltrated the village for the sake of revenge,
 but he changed his mind after meeting Naruto
 who was a spitting image of his sonΓÇª
 He probably knew that he didnΓÇÖt have long to live.
 If he was going to do something before dying,
 he wanted it to be the thing he found most funΓÇª
 He probably wanted to re-enact his treasure-hunts with his sonΓÇª
 using the traps he set to smash the Leaf.
 So thatΓÇÖs what it was.
 Well, itΓÇÖs just conjecture, though.
 So that old manΓÇª wasnΓÇÖt a bad personΓÇª
 I told you from the start.
 Those who like Ichiraku's ramen can't be bad people!
 What? But in actuality, didnΓÇÖt he hate ramen?
 Ichiraku ramen is different!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you can keep eating something you hate every day.
 Exactly!
 Old manΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª?
 The enemies who come to the Leaf wonΓÇÖt always be like this.
 Someone like Orochimaru might attack again!
 That means we must always be prepared!
 Right!
 ItΓÇÖs a pain, thoughΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll eat in preparation for that!
 WeΓÇÖll protect the Leaf Village!
 With all of us working togetherΓÇª
 On a checkerboard night

 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three from my village are also under your careΓÇª
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happens to deprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 WeΓÇÖve secured food and water after spending half a day.
 And now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned, this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into three and go scouting.
 However, whether we find other teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay. Scatter!
 Bushy-BrowΓÇÖs Pledge: Undying Love and Protection!
 I canΓÇÖt fall asleep...
 I need to protect these two.
 I slept great!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Did you take care of us?
 Thank you, Sakura!
 WeΓÇÖre totally better because of you!
 ThatΓÇÖs good...
 A prey must always stay tense and flee desperately
 in front of the predator!
 My voice is gone!
 It was just a dream...
 Is it daybreak already?!
 No, no way!
 A squirrel?
 DonΓÇÖt surprise me like that!
 Oh!
 That was too close.
 Do you think she noticed?
 The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it.
 Huh? Then what? What was it?
 WeΓÇÖll probably find out if we go closer.
 So... we should get going now.
 If I can catch all twenty of these leaves before they hit the ground
 Sakura will start to like me.
 If... if I canΓÇÖt catch even one of the leaves...!
 ItΓÇÖll be an unanswered love forever. Or ratherΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre too Bushy!
 ThatΓÇÖs what sheΓÇÖll say.
 One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight...
 nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,  fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
 nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen...
 One more!
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Phew... just in time.
 This is called a Paper Bomb and it explodes after some time.
 Who did such an awful thing?
 Stop hiding and come out.
 Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!
 Man, heΓÇÖs a damn pain and we've been discovered!
 Strategy One, ΓÇ£hide and let it pass,ΓÇ¥ was a failure!
 So now we carry out Strategy Two!
 Huh? Are you serious?
 What? You have a problem with that?
 ThereΓÇÖs no question of success.
 Well, I guess itΓÇÖs all right but...
 Wow! To meet last yearΓÇÖs Number One rookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!
 C-Can I have your autograph?
 So itΓÇÖs just you guys?
 Take that! Strategy Two, ΓÇ£head over heals infatuation with my sex appealΓÇ¥!
 IΓÇÖd been wanting to meet you for some time, you know?
 Get lost!
 Why? Why doesnΓÇÖt my sexiness work?!
 Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!
 Did you just raise your fists to me, and does that mean you want to fight?
 N-No... 					Of course not.
 Then get lost.
 Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps  like you
 would only make me the laughing stock of the village.
 Y-Yes!
 Huh... Really just like cockroaches.
 Just as I thought.
 A fellow like that wouldnΓÇÖt take a scroll away from wimps like us
 unless we were to turn on him.
 All right! LetΓÇÖs go find some wimps!
 Like IΓÇÖve been saying thereΓÇÖs no one wimpier than us...
 So a no-sleep lookout?
 But itΓÇÖs not necessary anymore.
 Wake Sasuke up. We want to battle with him.
 Y-You bastardsΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 What is it youΓÇÖre after?
 I know the one called Orochimaru is calling the shots from the shadows!
 Huh?!
 WhatΓÇÖs that strange bruise on the back of SasukeΓÇÖs neck?
 You did this to Sasuke.
 How can you say you want to fight him?!
 I wonderΓÇªwhat he has on his mind?
 However, I canΓÇÖt stay quiet after hearing that.
 I will kill this girl, IΓÇÖll also kill this Sasuke character.
 Wait, Zaku.
 Huh? What is it?
 ItΓÇÖs so clich├⌐.
 ItΓÇÖs the color of dirt  thatΓÇÖs just been dug up.
 This grass, it doesnΓÇÖt grow in a place like this, does it?
 Darn!
 You know, with a trap...
 thereΓÇÖs no point unless you make it so itΓÇÖs not discovered.
 Huh, how ridiculous!
 So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel wouldnΓÇÖt be caught in the trap ?
 We kill her now!
 A log?!
 A trap above too? Watch out!
 Just kidding.
 What?!
 Clearly you have no talent.
 Someone like you needs to make more of an effort or else!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 What?! This guy...
 Then you also should... make an effort!
 Who are you?
 IΓÇÖm the beautiful blue beast of Leaf Village, Rock Lee!
 Why are you here?
 I will always appear...
 whenever youΓÇÖre in trouble!
 Or should I say...
 It was really because of you, now run along.
 But right now, IΓÇÖm also your enemy!
 I did say this once before, didnΓÇÖt I?
 That IΓÇÖll protect you until I die.
 Please go out with me!
 IΓÇÖll protect you until I die!
 Oh...
 T-Thanks.
 Yes!
 Perfect! I did it! Gu Sensei, that was perfect!
 I guess it canΓÇÖt be helped...
 Zaku. IΓÇÖll give you Sasuke.
 I will kill them!
 As far as I can tell,  Sakura is in no condition to fight.
 That Bushy-Brow guy is  pretty proficient with Taijutsu...
 Looks like I can have some fun!
 There is a trick to your attack, isnΓÇÖt there?
 I wonΓÇÖt just simply avoid it.
 You showed me your Jutsu before.
 This guyΓÇªheΓÇÖs strong.
 Having said that,
 the odds arenΓÇÖt good since itΓÇÖs one versus three.
 IΓÇÖm gonna have to take a chance.
 One person at a time...
 IΓÇÖll give it my all and take each down!
 ThereΓÇÖs no one at all that seems wimpy!
 Well, the only team thatΓÇÖs weaker than us is the Naruto team.
 Idiot! You know what youΓÇÖre saying?
 What?!
 No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!
 But that team has the super genius Sasuke!
 Hah! I wonder...
 In actual battle that genius might easily be beaten.
 What?!
 All right, all right, I apologize for irritating you.
 What a pain...
 I say one negative thing about Sasuke and I get the evil eye, every timeΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way Sasuke could be taken down!
 SakuraΓÇÖs a different matter though!
 Huh?!
 Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...
 Huh?!
 ...and Sakura is fighting.
 What did you say?
 Hey!
 HeΓÇÖs late.
 That Lee...
 SomethingΓÇÖs not right.
 HeΓÇÖs always precise about time.
 Perhaps he ran into the enemy...
 Could it be...?
 Huh, that wouldnΓÇÖt have happened.
 In any case, letΓÇÖs find Lee!
 Right!
 Yes! IΓÇÖve finally mastered it! Yes! Yes!
 My friends, thereΓÇÖs no reason to give up on your youth!
 This Jutsu...
 In the end, only Lee  could make it his own.
 Yahoo!
 ΓÇô Hey Lee... ΓÇô I did it! I will do it!
 ΓÇô Lee! 					ΓÇô When I try! I try!
 Hey, Lee!
 Hey!
 Listen to this passionate message from your teacher!
 Oh... what is it?!
 Please tell me using hip words.
 This Jutsu, the ΓÇ£LotusΓÇ¥...
 it will be dealt with henceforth as a forbidden Jutsu.
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 W-What do you mean?
 This Jutsu poses a great burden on the cells of the muscles,
 itΓÇÖs a kind of ΓÇ£Self-sacrificing Technique.ΓÇ¥
 Humans normally utilize, at most, 20 percent...
 of the ΓÇ£powerΓÇ¥ that the muscles have.
 Do you understand? Only 20 percent!
 And if nearly 100 percent of the ΓÇ£powerΓÇ¥ is used
 the muscles themselves will disintegrate.
 So, the brain usually controls the ΓÇ£power.ΓÇ¥
 However, this Jutsu forces the brainΓÇÖs limiter to go off by using Chakra,
 allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...
 In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu which relies on a secret technique
 that brings forth ΓÇ£powerΓÇ¥ almost  to the limit of oneΓÇÖs body.
 So the only time it is all right to use this Jutsu
 is when a certain condition is met...
 So... when is that?
 Take this to heart...
 The condition is
 Guy Sensei...
 I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.
 Because this is the time you said...
 ""When protecting a previous person!""
 He disappeared?!
 Oh, oh no!
 There's no way he can break his fall!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 This feeling...
 Well well...
 Just in time.
 T-That's impossible!
 That is a frightening Jutsu...
 It did this much even though I fell on the spongy dirt.
 It's now my turn.
 Oh no!
 With what I just did...
 Lee!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that
 and is the speed of sound!
 I'll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm so frustrated!
 I'm just pulling feet again.
 I'm always just being protected.
 I always just watch them from behind.
 This time, I need to protect everyone!
 Naruto, Sasuke, Lee!
 I want to be like you too!

220,"So this is the Shukaku?
 ItΓÇÖs the first time IΓÇÖve seen the real thingΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs dangerous here! We have to get away!
 But! Gaara SenseiΓÇª
 Shut up.
 Gaara is tryingΓÇªto protect you!
 So hurry!
 R-Right.
 Hey! Could that beΓÇª?!
 YeahΓÇª
 The Shukaku transformation is starting.
 GaaraΓÇª
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Hinata, Sakura.
 Matsuri, you okay?
 Y-Yes. But Gaara SenseiΓÇª
 I leave her to youΓÇª
 Hold it! You are badly hurt!
 ButΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖll just become unable to move right away!
 IΓÇÖll give you some first-aid treatment!
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, ΓÇ£See youΓÇªΓÇ¥
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if IΓÇÖm not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Departure
 This is badΓÇª ItΓÇÖs a matter of time.
 I knew it.
 Sakura! Hurry! lt looks like we donΓÇÖt have much time!
 Got it! First, put your hands out.
 R-RightΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this?
 What is it, Neji?
 That guy wearing the armor is releasing Chakra stronger than GaaraΓÇª
 whoΓÇÖs half transformed into a beast.
 That person called himself Seimei, the creator of the Village of Artisans.
 He said something about being reborn as the ultimate Ninja tool.
 That jerk! HeΓÇÖs taken away GaaraΓÇÖs Chakra!
 Come to think of it, the enemy we fought wore similar armorΓÇª
 and took away a great deal of my Chakra.
 Armor that sucks up ChakraΓÇª
 And that alarming formΓÇª
 It doesnΓÇÖt look like we can just carelessly get close.
 NowΓÇª What do we do?
 I didnΓÇÖt figure on fighting against the ShukakuΓÇª
 However, this is fun, too.
 As great as the Shukaku may be, this way, I can prove that
 itΓÇÖs no match for the ultimate Ninja tool of the Village of Artisans.
 Why is this guy so strong?
 I wonΓÇÖt allow my important peopleΓÇª
 to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you,
 even if that means that I have to kill you!
 WhyΓÇª?
 How is it that you can fight so much for other peopleΓÇª?
 They saved me from the hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I wasΓÇª
 thatΓÇÖs whyΓÇª they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 and to love and watch over that personΓÇª
 LoveΓÇª
 That is why he is so strong?
 Gaara!
 WhatΓÇÖs that? Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?
 What happened to him?!
 Gaara might be suppressing Shukaku of his own volition.
 Why? WouldnΓÇÖt he end up weakening his own battle strength?
 Even so, he chose to fight with his own strength and will,
 not Shukaku's power, which he canΓÇÖt control.
 So you couldnΓÇÖt maintain the Shukaku body with that Chakra?
 IΓÇÖllΓÇªhelp the friends important to me with my own powerΓÇª
 How absurd.
 A Shinobi doesnΓÇÖt need emotion.
 It is those who suppress their emotions who can obtain great power.
 Great power. That power is the only justice.
 YouΓÇÖre finished now.
 Eat this!
 ThatΓÇÖs as far as you go, monster of the Sand Village.
 Acting tough, huhΓÇª?
 You shouldnΓÇÖt have any Chakra left to fight with.
 Indeed,  I only have a little bit of Chakra leftΓÇª
 But do you think I just sat around in the cage doing nothing at all?
 What?!
 Sand Tsunami!
 You shouldnΓÇÖt have any sand you can control!
 IΓÇÖm Gaara of the desert!
 ItΓÇÖs simple for me to crush rocks and turn them into sand.
 Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!
 So you still had that much power left, huh?
 Then IΓÇÖll just suck up all of that power!
 GaaraΓÇÖs Chakra is being sucked out!
 ΓÇô Wha--?! 					ΓÇô Gaara Sensei!
 ΓÇô Damn it! 					ΓÇô Wait! Naruto!
 What, Shikamaru? DonΓÇÖt stop me!
 YouΓÇÖll just get in the way if you go!
 Besides, our Gaara is strong!
 GaaraΓÇª
 Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:
 Shukaku's Pike!
 Wh-WhyΓÇª? Why could youΓÇª?
 Someone who gave up on being human and was reborn as a Ninja tool
 could never understand anyway.
 I donΓÇÖt understand. Why?
 Why?!
 Giant Sand Burial!
 He did it!
 Gaara Sensei won!
 Yeah! Gaara!
 ΓÇô Gaara! 					ΓÇô Gaara!
 HeΓÇÖs okayΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs just extremely fatigued
 on account of using his Chakra all at once.
 Gaara completely suppressed the Shukaku on his own volition.
 YeahΓÇª
 I want to work hard
 and become an existence acknowledged by other peopleΓÇª
 I thought that looking at Naruto Uzumaki.
 Ties with other peopleΓÇª
 For me, until now, that was just hate and murderous intent.
 However, thereΓÇÖs something IΓÇÖve understood just a littleΓÇª
 about the ties he goes so far for and talks about.
 Suffering, sorrow and happiness can be shared with someone.
 YouΓÇÖve also made someone you can share with at lastΓÇª
 Did you say something?
 No, nothingΓÇª
 We came to the trouble of rushing here.
 To think itΓÇÖd be overΓÇª
 It seems the inexperienced knuckleheads
 have grown a teeny weeny bitΓÇª
 You are very strict.
 Pervy Sage!
 Oh, long time no see, Naruto.
 DonΓÇÖt give me that ΓÇ£long time no seeΓÇ¥ garbage, you jerk Sage!
 You were talking all big about watching my training,
 making me into your prot├⌐g├⌐ and stuff!
 Where were you traipsing around until now?!
 Well, how can I put this? I was gathering information.
 It was probably just information on naked ladies anyway, right?
 You idiot!
 Even I come through when it countsΓÇª
 I was mainly after information on the Akatsuki.
 Akatsuki!
 With this IΓÇÖve been able to verify their actions.
 And now as promised,
 two years later when theyΓÇÖll move into high gear,
 I will thoroughly train you.
 I wonder if youΓÇÖre prepared?
 IΓÇÖve been tired of waiting!
 I owe you one.
 No. I just repaid the debt from last time.
 Next time, IΓÇÖll settle things more properly.
 Well, this time IΓÇÖll acknowledge that you didnΓÇÖt cry.
 Not again.
 Just like a womanΓÇª
 What about him?
 Huh?
 Naruto?
 I hear heΓÇÖs leaving today on a training journey with Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?
 Yeah. 					ltΓÇÖs such a pain.
 HeΓÇÖs going to come back having gotten stronger again.
 See you around.
 ΓÇô FarewellΓÇª 					ΓÇô See ya.
 Please tell NarutoΓÇª
 Thanks to him,
 I figured out what the words Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.
 IΓÇÖll dedicate myself under Gaara Sensei from now onΓÇª
 What did he do?
 Well, I guess thatΓÇÖs about it.
 I read the Village of Artisans report from the other day.
 Although it didnΓÇÖt go as far as a perfect 100,
 IΓÇÖll give you a passing grade.
 No! IΓÇÖm still very much lacking in experience.
 Of course!
 IΓÇÖll have you carry out several missions
 and get you to build up lots of experience,
 so make sure to dedicate yourself!
 What?! Does that mean IΓÇÖm totally going to get overworked?
 Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?
 Ino?
 Sure. WhatΓÇÖs up?
 As, as it happens, I was thinking about it the whileΓÇª
 But it became totally clear to me on this mission!
 Clear that IΓÇÖd be no good at all at this rate!
 Ino.
 ItΓÇÖs frustrating, but I was envious of you.
 You, who everyone depended on.
 So, please. I also want to become a Medical Ninja.
 I know itΓÇÖll be hard.
 But IΓÇÖve got guts and IΓÇÖll manage the studying, no matter what.
 So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?
 ΓÇô Sure. 					ΓÇô Really?!
 But prepare yourself.
 Once that happens, youΓÇÖll be my little sister prot├⌐g├⌐.
 WhatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 Naturally!
 After all, IΓÇÖll be your Medical Ninja superior, you know.
 Man, I canΓÇÖt wait.
 YouΓÇÖll be my lovable little sister prot├⌐g├⌐.
 IΓÇÖll train you nice and hard.
 Just you watch! IΓÇÖll pass you up right away!
 Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!
 IΓÇÖll do it! Billboard Brow!
 Why?! Why is it?!
 What are you talking about?!
 Why was I the only one left out of the mission the other day?!
 But you were with a different team then, right?
 But everyone had taken part!
 SheΓÇÖs kind of in a rage.
 ItΓÇÖs hard being the only one left out of a mission.
 Come to think of it,
 it seems Naruto finally leaves for training.
 I heard. It seems that Jiraiya is going to be his mentor.
 Damn it! That guyΓÇÖs going to get strong again.
 It looks like the village will get quiet for a while.
 Viewed in that light, itΓÇÖs a little bit sad, isnΓÇÖt it?
 No! This isnΓÇÖt the time to be getting sad!
 I must work hard!
 Several times more, several times more.
 If I donΓÇÖt work hard hundreds of times more than Naruto,
 I wonΓÇÖt be able to face him the next time we meet.
 Your guard is off!
 We also must grow by that time.
 ItΓÇÖs because trying to improve by learning from others,
 that is whatΓÇÖs called friendship.
 Good grief, weΓÇÖd better not lose, Akamaru.
 Same here!
 Hey, you okay, Lee?!
 IΓÇÖm fine, IΓÇÖm fine.
 Lady Hinata, letΓÇÖs call it a day.
 What? IΓÇÖm stillΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs about time for his departure.
 Oh!
 You wonΓÇÖt be able to see him for a while.
 I seeΓÇª It looks like youΓÇÖll be on a long journeyΓÇª
 Yeah!
 Listen up. Be sure to train and donΓÇÖt goof off.
 Right! You can count on me!
 ItΓÇÖs about time to go, Naruto.
 Right!
 Okay! IΓÇÖm off, Iruka Sensei!
 IΓÇÖll pay you back for the ramen once IΓÇÖve become a success.
 JeezΓÇª
 Good luck, Naruto.
 Keep your eyes on me.
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?! IΓÇÖll leave you behind, Naruto.
 Hey. H-Hey, wait up!
 I also have to work hard in order to catch up with Naruto.
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 ItΓÇÖs been two years since his departure.
 Now the count down to the battle begins.
 Those who pursue and those who are pursued.
 Time will not wait for the boy.
 As Akatsuki Organization begins to take action,

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain

 Your next mission was commissioned by a certain Feudal LordΓÇÖs daughter.
 You are to act as her double.
 I donΓÇÖt know where she heard about you,
 but you apparently bear a striking resemblance to the princess.
 Therefore she requested that you be the one who carries it outΓÇª
 A doubleΓÇª?
 Is someone targeting the princess?
 Well, if anything, sheΓÇÖs the one whoΓÇÖs doing the targetingΓÇª
 Huh?
 Not to worry.
 YouΓÇÖre already an admirable Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
 Furthermore, IΓÇÖve arranged for you to have an assistant.
 Assistant?
 Grandma Tsunade! You have a mission for me?
 And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!
 Huh?! 					Lady Tsunade!
 Sorry, but all the other guys are too busy.
 Just me and this guy?
 Yup. Do your best to carry out the mission.
 The client is a Feudal LordΓÇÖs daughter, huhΓÇª
 WowΓÇª I guess that means that IΓÇÖve finally became good enough
 to handle amazing missions like this, huh?!
 Hey, donΓÇÖt get too excited.
 Terrible things happen when you're like that.
 I knowΓÇª Just leave things in my capable hands!
 YouΓÇÖre really a piece of workΓÇª
 Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!
 Thank you for coming from afar.
 ThatΓÇÖs the client?
 She and Ino really do look alike, butΓÇª
 I-ItΓÇÖs a bit of a stretchΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs all right. I have an idea of what you wish to say.
 My physique doesnΓÇÖt really resemble that of the double thereΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what youΓÇÖre thinking, right?
 ΓÇô OhΓÇªnot at allΓÇª UmmΓÇª ΓÇô To be honest,
 ΓÇô I donΓÇÖt think you resemble her at all. ΓÇô Hey!
 Well, I donΓÇÖt blame you for thinking that. But here, have a look at this!
 T-ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªlno!
 ThatΓÇÖs what I looked like a short time agoΓÇª
 Truth be told, I only got like this
 after it was decided that I was to have an arranged courtship.
 An arranged courtship?!
 The other party is Master Chikara from the neighboring Land of Udon.
 Ever since I saw his picture,
 my feelings for him have deepened day by day.
 And as the day of the arranged courtship grows closer,
 I have become increasingly nervous, my cheeks have been flushed,
 and my heart has been pounding.
 I canΓÇÖt even sleep at night.
 And because of that stress, IΓÇÖve started overeatingΓÇª
 It goes without saying that youΓÇÖll get fat if you pig out.
 Of course, IΓÇÖve taken appropriate countermeasures!
 IΓÇÖve been using something that cuts all the fats and carbohydrates that I ingestΓÇª
 ""Easy-Peasy Slim SpecialΓÇ¥
 It didnΓÇÖt work, did it?
 I placed too strong hopes in itΓÇª
 How can I possibly have an arranged courtship
 with the man IΓÇÖm infatuated with when I look like this?
 So thatΓÇÖs my situationΓÇª Now, letΓÇÖs get to the main issue.
 I want you to attend the arranged courtship in my place
 and make it a success at any cost.
 Huh?! 					So this double thing
 is just to act on you behalf at some arranged courtship?!
 What do you mean by ΓÇ£some arranged courtshipΓÇ¥?!
 I mean, when you talk about doubles, you thinks of situations
 where someoneΓÇÖs life is in danger and that sort of thing.
 What are you talking about?!
 The princessΓÇÖs entire life is at stake! This is major!
 Oh! So you understand a heart in loveΓÇª
 I sure doΓÇª A girl always wants to look cute
 for the guy she loves.
 Even if sheΓÇÖs a fakeΓÇª?
 It canΓÇÖt be helped. I mean, guys prefer slender girls.
 ThatΓÇÖs exactly right!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 Sure thing! Leave it to me!
 But even if the arranged courtship goes wellΓÇª
 The gap is just too big.
 IΓÇÖll just have to lose weight by the day of the wedding.
 I already have a plan in place for that.
 This supplemental type diet food, ΓÇ£Supplement SlenderΓÇ¥!
 If I supplement all three meals with thisΓÇª
 Why donΓÇÖt you draw on the lessons youΓÇÖre supposed to have learnedΓÇª?
 In any case, IΓÇÖll use my charms to make this arranged courtship a success!
 This annex is where I often played in my childhood.
 I plan to use this to listen in on the arranged courtship from here.
 HuhΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs pretty convenient.
 I would love to meet him in person if I could, butΓÇª
 Hey, is he that cool looking?
 Of course he is!
 HeΓÇÖs someone with something really special about him!
 Well then, just make sure he falls for you.
 Leave it to me!
 I thought you werenΓÇÖt motivatedΓÇª
 Well, this is a mission after all.
 So I think IΓÇÖll pull myself together and hustle!
 DonΓÇÖt do anything unnecessary, okay!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs up?
 The sound is getting closer!
 ΓÇô What? 					ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs so bright!
 There are many a handsome man in this world,
 but this man is renowned even among them!
 This man makes Land of Udon what it isΓÇª
 that sexy man with glistening sidelong glances!
 The oh-so-great young prince ChikaraΓÇª
 Kneel down and bow before him!
 Sorry.
 It appears that I have kept you waiting, princess
 You'reΓÇªMaster Chikara?
 HeΓÇÖs even more intense than lntense-Brow Sensei.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, pretty girl.
 I have constitutional low blood pressure.
 Dunno. He looks more like he has high blood pressure to meΓÇª
 What?
 D-Do you always scatter flower petals?
 Flowers are wonderful.
 They truly allay the fatigue of your mind and your body.
 DonΓÇÖt you find them relaxing?
 I-I guessΓÇª
 Okay then, nextΓÇª
 Hey, donΓÇÖt you think heΓÇÖs different from her descriptionΓÇª?
 I mean, heΓÇÖs faΓÇª
 FaΓÇª?!
 Stop!
 These sweets are really fabulous, aren't they?
 Do excuse us a little.
 What the heck are you doing, out of the blue like that?!
 ItΓÇÖs womenΓÇÖs intuition.
 I got the same vibe from him as Choji.
 That word is probably taboo.
 Oh, I see!
 Gimme a break!
 WhatΓÇÖs up with that uselessly intense chubby guy showing up
 when she told us heΓÇÖd be a handsome prince?!
 But wouldnΓÇÖt his physique be a perfect match for her?
 IΓÇÖm sure there must be some mistake.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way a girl would fall in love with a guy like that.
 But maybe thatΓÇÖs the princessΓÇÖ taste in menΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs impossible. I meanΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs flashyΓÇª!
 IntenseΓÇª!
 And a fatso!
 HeΓÇÖs a freak! A freak!
 ThereΓÇÖs gotta be a mistake! IΓÇÖm sure of it!
 Y-You think so?
 What are you saying?
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake that thatΓÇÖs Master Chikara, the man of my heart.
 I thought soΓÇª
 What an elegant manΓÇª
 I deeply regret that I cannot see him up close with my very own eyes.
 I guess one could say that everybody has their own set of woes.
 Listen, make sure that he takes a liking to me no matter what!
 Stop complaining and get the ball rolling with dogged persistence!
 I will convey that to her.
 Has you tension not eased? Music is good for relaxation.
 Please, you need not go to the troubleΓÇª
 ΓÇô What did she say? ΓÇô She said thereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!
 I canΓÇÖt believe it!
 ItΓÇÖs our mission, you know!
 I know thatΓÇª
 Princess FukuΓÇªdo you like roses?
 YesΓÇªvery much soΓÇª
 Great! 					I love roses too!
 In the language of flowers, they signify love!
 But don't their meanings differ depending on their color?
 For example, yellow roses are supposed to mean ΓÇ£LetΓÇÖs break upΓÇ¥ΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs nonsense to discriminate because of colorΓÇª
 I mean the flowers are not at fault, after all.
 For you.
 HeyΓÇªwait!
 Huh?
 I canΓÇÖt do it! I canΓÇÖt do it!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way! HeΓÇÖs too intense.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way I can act as a substitute for the princess!
 Calm down. Stop saying that and do your best.
 Nope. I just canΓÇÖt stand him physically.
 Oh, I got it.
 If you just think of him
 ΓÇô as a somewhat intense ChojiΓÇª ΓÇô Choji has fat on him
 for the sake of his NinjutsuΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt have the slightest idea what purpose that princeΓÇÖs fat serves.
 ThatΓÇÖs a pretty severe opinion, you knowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going off somewhere for a moment.
 Huh? Hey, where are you going?!
 Gimme a break, that girlΓÇÖs a handfulΓÇª
 Well, this is for the sake of a mission after all.
 I guess itΓÇÖs about time for Naruto to lend a helping hand!
 What is it?!
 IΓÇÖm not judging you, but I think you should pass on that young prince.
 ThereΓÇÖs something wrong with his head. IΓÇÖm positive!
 What are you saying? HeΓÇÖs a passionate and wonderful man!
 ButΓÇª
 I hired the Leaf to provide me with substitute for
 the arranged courtship and bring it to success.
 YouΓÇÖre a professional Shinobi, right?
 So I suggest you get on it and get the job done!
 The atmosphere in there hasnΓÇÖt been very congenial at all!
 You need to be aggressive in making yourself appealing to him!
 IΓÇÖm sorry to have kept you waiting, Chikara!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! Just like thatΓÇªhuh?
 That jerkΓÇª!
 H-Hey!
 P-P-Princess?
 Master ChikaraΓÇª Could you loosen my sash for me, please?
 ButΓÇªbutΓÇª
 Please.
 Oh my gosh!
 ThereΓÇÖs a creepy-crawler up here under the roof that looks like a sow bug!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 A creepy-crawler that looks like a sow bug?
 An insect?
 OhΓÇªshe vanishedΓÇª
 What the heck are you thinking?!
 Where is the princess?
 I donΓÇÖt know.
 She vanishedΓÇª
 What is going on anyway?
 This is starting to irritate meΓÇª I canΓÇÖt get whatΓÇÖs happening from here.
 Why are you meddling! I was just one step away!
 What do you think youΓÇÖre doing, dressed up like Princess Fuku?!
 IΓÇÖm telling you!
 In one of Pervy SageΓÇÖs books happened to glance at,
 this is the kind of thing that worked.
 I donΓÇÖt believe that anyone would use such a garish advance!
 ThatΓÇÖs dirty!
 ThereΓÇÖs absolutely no way a type of guy like you
 would ever be mistaken for the protagonist of a boyΓÇÖs comic!
 Huh! I was doing a way better job than you were!
 Gimme a breakΓÇª
 Now that things have come to this,
 I need to take care of business before another meddler gets in the way!
 HuhΓÇª You gotta be kiddingΓÇª
 It looks like my help is needed if this mission is going to be a success.
 PrincessΓÇª where in the world have you been?
 Please forgive me. I was so nervous I just flew into a panic earlier onΓÇª
 You really seemed like a totally different person.
 IΓÇÖm so sorry.
 You were such a wonderful person, that it became almost unbearableΓÇª
 Non. That is bad.
 We must change the air in here then.
 Oh, in that case, I willΓÇª
 HiΓÇª Chikara!
 Huh?
 That just now, outside the sliding paper doorΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 There was one moreΓÇªprincess!
 That canΓÇÖt beΓÇª Impossible.
 INNER INO 							NarutoΓÇª!
 But IΓÇÖm very moved that you have such deep feelings for me
 that you actually saw a visionΓÇª
 Vision? No, I definitely sawΓÇª
 You mustnΓÇÖt look!
 P-Princess?
 DamnΓÇªI did that without thinkingΓÇª
 Oh goodness meΓÇª
 In my ardent desire for you to look just at me, IΓÇª
 What intense passionΓÇª
 All rightΓÇª As you wish, princess.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Allow me to catch
 those hot feelings in fine style!
 Could this beΓÇª?
 Come, donΓÇÖt hold back.
 Huh?!
 You may not kiss him! No kisses!
 Oh!
 Goodness, you cannot be too careful these days!
 Who told you that you could go as far as kissing him?!
 Oh, itΓÇÖs not that I wanted toΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd have to say that you actually came to my rescue.
 DonΓÇÖt bandy words with me!
 Listen carefully, holding hands is as much as I can concede to youΓÇª!
 YouΓÇÖre too loud!
 The princess vanished again.
 ΓÇô Princess! 					ΓÇô Princess!
 This isnΓÇÖt good! I better hurry back.
 DonΓÇÖt try anything funny in there!
 I know that! In any case, we canΓÇÖt let him see the two of us together!
 Hurry back to your room, Princess!
 All right.
 Gimme a break that InoΓÇª
 Dumping me in the lake like that. Thanks to her IΓÇÖm freezing!
 This is bad! I gotta peeΓÇª Gotta go!
 I donΓÇÖt know where the toilet is around here.
 ThereΓÇÖs nobody aroundΓÇª Well, it is an emergency situation after all.
 Huh?!
 W-W-What the heck do you think youΓÇÖre doing over there looking like me?!
 NoΓÇªthis isΓÇªumΓÇª
 How shameless! Stop that immediately!
 I canΓÇÖt stop itΓÇª
 Do you not understand that IΓÇÖm telling you to stop!
 ItΓÇÖs impossible to stop so sudden!
 Hey!
 Wait up!
 I wasnΓÇÖt quite emotionally prepared earlier onΓÇª
 However, the feelings I have for you in my heart are true.
 PrincessΓÇª
 Master ChikaraΓÇª
 I have harbored a secret love for you for a long time.
 Please, take meΓÇª
 Huh?
 ΓÇô I wonder what that sound is? ΓÇô I have no ideaΓÇª
 Rain?
 What a beautiful rainbowΓÇª
 Stop, I say!
 I told you, itΓÇÖs impossible!
 Ouch!
 Princess?!
 Naruto!
 You idiot!
 Forgive me for this one, please!
 I wonΓÇÖt forgive you!
 Look what youΓÇÖve done!
 OuchΓÇª Stop!
 What in the world is going on?!
 Oh no!ΓÇª 					UmmΓÇªthis is, wellΓÇª
 All right, thatΓÇÖs enoughΓÇª We can't fake it any longer.
 I apologize for having hoodwinked you. I amΓÇªthe bona fide Fuku.
 You mean to say that the princess up to now was an imposter?
 That is correct.
 What is the meaning of all this?
 I wouldnΓÇÖt have imagined that things would come to such a finale!
 No, thatΓÇÖs not correct, Master Chikara!
 Out of my way!
 The super body I fantasized about in my dreams! My ideal personified!
 Bravo!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 My cute princess. Please marry me!
 IΓÇÖm delighted, Master Chikara!
 Hail the future wife!
 What is this anywayΓÇª?
 Somehow it seems like our mission turned out to be success in the endΓÇª
 I think?
 Could it be? I put all my efforts in making advances on a guy
 whoΓÇÖs not my type in the least and got rejected.
 Moreover, it was a totally wasted effortΓÇª
 Is that what happened?
 But, everything turned out well. So isnΓÇÖt it okay?
 And both of them look so happy togetherΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not the problem! A damselΓÇÖs heart has been woundedΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt believe that, of all things, I was brushed off by a guy like thatΓÇª
 He didnΓÇÖt even glance in your direction at the end there.
 Stop it! DonΓÇÖt remind me.
 You can never knows what a person likes, can you?
 NopeΓÇª thereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖll acknowledge that!
 A manΓÇÖs got to like a slender girl better!
 In order to become even more of a woman,
 IΓÇÖm going on a diet! On a diet!
 WaitΓÇªwait up!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardustΓÇÖs are rapidly dancing
 I just canΓÇÖt come out and say, ΓÇ£Ah, I donΓÇÖt want to go home yet.ΓÇ¥
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs from that coke I just drank?
 Naruto, letΓÇÖs make some bittersweet memories of youth together!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô No need to be shy.
 I am ready both in mind and body!
 What are you blabbing about all of a sudden?!
 It was longΓÇª
 To think how much IΓÇÖve waited for this moment!
 I have no idea what youΓÇÖre talking about!
 Here I come Naruto! Please become my first.
 Just a minute.

 The Final Rounds: Rush to the Battle Arena!
 WhatΓÇÖs up? ItΓÇÖs been a while.
 Heh-hehΓÇª I was kind of in the hospital.
 The hospital?
 IΓÇÖm totally fine, now.
 Nothing to it!
 I see.
 Ayame!
 Yes!
 Here you go.
 Pops?
 Just eat it.
 The final round is tomorrow, right?
 Okay, then.
 Thanks!
 YouΓÇÖve got a daughter at home, so itΓÇÖs not so bad, right?
 Most of my money vanishes with the food expenses.
 Moron. Your home is special, right?
 Huh?
 Girls are a drag.
 Yeah. There are times when I really donΓÇÖt get how to act with her.
 FatherΓÇÖs have it roughΓÇª
 Hah, am I the only bad guy?
 Hey, master.
 Let me have everything on these two pages, too!
 Welcome!
 Oh! Strong reinforcements!
 Come on. You order something, too!
 HeyΓÇªDad.
 Hmm?
 Hey! LetΓÇÖs go home, already!
 Excuse me?
 Shut up. YouΓÇÖre supposed to live it up at a festival!
 Festival, my buttΓÇª
 What a drag.
 You idiotΓÇª Since olden timesΓÇª
 the final roundΓÇÖs been like a festival!
 IΓÇÖm in that final round tomorrow.
 Jeez, donΓÇÖt make come to get you.
 YouΓÇÖreΓÇªin it?

 Tomorrow, ehΓÇª
 Yeah.
 TomorrowΓÇªis a full moonΓÇª

 Shall we get going?
 I was nervous and couldnΓÇÖt sleep.
 FirstΓÇªitΓÇÖs himΓÇª in the first match.

 The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!
 Yeah. HeΓÇÖs the number one rookie from last year, right?!

 Now I can summon a frogΓÇª ltΓÇÖll be okay.
 They allΓÇªlook nasty.
 Hinata!
 Yipes! N-N-Naruto.
 W-What are you doing here?
 Today is the final round, isnΓÇÖt it?
 IΓÇª Just somethingΓÇª
 I came to check out this training field.
 This is the place where I became Genin, soΓÇª
 Really? W-Why?
 N-NothingΓÇªThat doesnΓÇÖt matter!
 Y-YouΓÇÖre right. IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Say, HinataΓÇª
 NejiΓÇÖs a relative of yours, right?
 Y-Yes.
 Is he really strong ΓÇª?
 YesΓÇª
 I see.
 B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.
 Yeah. IΓÇÖm strong, after all!
 I bet you can win, Naruto.
 What?
 You knowΓÇª
 IΓÇªwhen you cheered for me,
 I felt like I was able to become stronger than before.
 Hinata! Hang tough!
 When the preliminaries ended,
 I became able to like myself just a little.
 I'llΓÇª
 standΓÇª
 by my ownΓÇª
 words.
 That is my way of Ninja.
 From someone else's standpoint, it might not look like anythingΓÇÖs changedΓÇª
 but I feel like I was able to change.
 IΓÇÖve been thinking that it wasΓÇª thanks to you, Naruto.
 Say, HinataΓÇª
 Did you really think so?
 What?
 I may look strong to you,
 but all I do is mess upΓÇª
 And I act tough because IΓÇÖm frustrated.
 ItΓÇÖs not like that!
 Even when you messed up,
 in my viewΓÇªyou were always a proud failure.
 W-When I look at you, it impacts my heart.
 YouΓÇÖre not perfect, soΓÇª
 SoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs because you mess upΓÇª
 that you have the strength to rise up from that.
 I think such strength is true strength.
 IΓÇªI think youΓÇÖre an incredibly strong person.
 Thanks, Hinata!
 Even though I was always the bottom oneΓÇª
 I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!
 I was depressed, which was totally not my character.
 But I feel better now!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Okay! IΓÇÖm off to the match!
 HinataΓÇª
 Huh?
 I kind ofΓÇªthought you wereΓÇª
 W-WhatΓÇª?
 ΓÇªgloomy, hesitant and weird.
 NarutoΓÇª
 But I quite likeΓÇªpeopleΓÇª
 like you!
 ΓÇªlike you!
 Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me kick that NejiΓÇÖs butt!
 Uh-oh. Time to run!
 I-IΓÇÖm late, late!
 See you later, Hinata!
 Sorry IΓÇÖm late, Hinata.
 Well, ShinoΓÇÖs match isnΓÇÖt until quite a bit later, soΓÇª
 Hm? Hey? Hinata?
 Hmm? W-What?
 Oh, itΓÇÖs starting!
 Move, move!
 C'mon, move!
 Dang it! ThereΓÇÖs quite a distance!
 I wonΓÇÖt make it!
 Brother Naruto!
 Konohamaru?!
 IΓÇÖve come to aid in brotherΓÇÖs crisis, here!
 KonohamaruΓÇª WhatΓÇÖre you doing here?!
 IΓÇÖll tell you later!
 This way, here!
 ThereΓÇÖs an ace shortcut where you can get straight to the arena, here!
 What?!
 All right! Well done, Konohamaru!
 Those who control the secret path control time.
 Oh, I see! YouΓÇÖre awesome, Konohamaru!
 As I recall, thereΓÇÖs a hole in the wall around hereΓÇª
 Oh!
 Here it is!
 Oh!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Konohamaru?
 The secret path has been repaired, here!
 WhaatΓÇª?
 Oh! ThereΓÇÖs no time!
 Brother!
 Next approach!
 Look! IΓÇÖm really out of time.
 ItΓÇÖs a secret, but thereΓÇÖs an awesome path
 that can get you inside the arena in an instant, here!
 What?! All right! Well done, Konohamaru!
 This hole is a shortcut?
 ItΓÇÖs a straight shot to the final round arena!
 No doubt, here!
 Straight shot, huh? 					Okay!
 LetΓÇÖs hurry!
 Yeah!
 Konohamaru! WhatΓÇÖs happening here?!
 ItΓÇÖs okay, here!
 WeΓÇÖre almost to the final round arena, here!
 See? ThereΓÇÖs the exit, here!
 Oh, oh.
 What?!
 Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!
 T-This isΓÇªsome kind of mistake!
 Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 WeΓÇÖve gotten further and further away!
 Until just recently,
 it was connected to the final round arena, here.
 Next approach, right awayΓÇª
 This is it!
 If you ride this, youΓÇÖll get to the final round arena just like that, here!
 Huh? A bull?
 Think again, brother.
 A feudal lord Bull is not at all in the same league as ordinary cows, here.
 Once they start running, even race horses grow deathly pale.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way they can beat a no-nonsense feudal lord cow!
 Anyway, itΓÇÖs an awesome cow!
 Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,
 itΓÇÖs just a short run to the final round arena, here!
 Then, IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 Okay, letΓÇÖs go!
 Huh? Wha--?!
 Ouch!
 What?
 Brother, go for it, here!
 Hey! Stop! Stop!
 Hey-hey, weΓÇÖre missing quite a few people.
 WhatΓÇÖs going on? ltΓÇÖs going to start.
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this? SasukeΓÇª?
 And even NarutoΓÇª
 Why is it?!
 This is bad!
 That's it!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong with you guys? Why are you back, hey?!

 Huh? What are you talking about?
 Jeez! IΓÇÖm serious. So many of themΓÇª!
 Huh? HeyΓÇª 					Where's Sasuke?

 Keep your eyes open and watch me defeat this unpleasant guy!

 People definitely can change.

25,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 I think we almost finished shaking off the losers.
 Then I guess I'll move onto the main issue.
 It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.
 All right!
 Here is the tenth question!
 Here it comes!
 I have to put everything on the line for this question!
 The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!
 Hmph! Making such a big deal.
 This is the final obstacle.
 Kankuro, come back already!
 If he starts the tenth question, your cheat sheet has no meaning!
 But before that,
 I'm going to add some rules for the last question.
 Aren't you lucky?
 It looks like playing with the dolls wasn't a waste, after all?
 This guy.
 He's figured Crow out!
 Anyway, sit down.
 Let me explain!
 These are
 the hopeless rules!
 Well, anyhow.
 There's nothing to do when the subordinates are gone, huh?
 Well, it'll get busy soon enough.
 Why?
 This year's first proctor...
 I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.
 Well then, passing the first exam already seems iffy.
 Of all the people, that sadist...
 Sadist?
 Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,  so you wouldn't know.
 Who is this person?
 He is a pro, a professional.
 Professional? Of what?
 Torture and interrogation.
 What?!
 Well, there maybe no physical torture in the exam itself,
 but he's sure to use his his skills as an interrogator
 to torment them psychologically.
 That is...
 Leaf Village Anbu's Torture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,
 Ibiki Morino!
 Hopeless rules...?!
 First, you guys will have to choose
 whether or not you will take this 10th question!
 Huh?!
 Choose whether or not to take the exam?
 What, choose?!
 What happens if you choose not to take the 10th exam?
 If you chose not to take the exam, then your score will be zero.
 In other words, you fail!
 And of course, the same goes for the two others in the same group!
 W-What does that mean!
 Of course, everybody is going to choose to take the exam!
 This is ridiculous! As if we have a choice!
 And... one more rule...
 Another one?!
 Finish with it already!
 If you chose to take it and are unable to answer it correctly,
 then you will have to...
 relinquish your right of taking the Chunin Exam forever.
 What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!
 Besides, there are plenty of people here
 who have taken the Chunin Exam many times!
 You're just unlucky.
 I make the rule this year.
 But I did give you the option to go back!
 For those of you who aren't confident, you can choose not to take it
 and take the exam next year or the year after that.
 Oh! How terrible!
 If one out of the three chooses not to take the exam,
 then all three will be failed.
 If you do choose to take it, but get the wrong answer...
 then that person will be a Genin for the rest of their life!
 No matter what, the odds are against us!
 It's an impossible choice for anyone with normal nerves!
 Then, let's begin...
 The 10th questionΓÇª
 Those who will not be taking it, raise your hands!
 Once I confirm your number, I'll ask you to leave!
 What kind of a question is it going to beΓÇª.?
 Darn!
 If I get it wrong, I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.
 I don't want that!
 But if I choose not take it...!
 then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too! I don't want that either!
 I won't raise my hand!
 I'm confident that I can answer it correctly.
 ButΓÇª
 But Naruto! You're different!
 You should retreat this time even if it means to ignore us
 and think of your next chance to take the Exam!
 I... I...
 I'm quitting! I'm not going to take it!
 #50 failed!
 # 130, #111 will be failed as well...
 I-I'm sorry... Gennai! Inaho!
 Darn...
 M-Me too!
 Me too!
 Naruto...
 Why don't you raise your hand?
 That guy...
 I am the super elite ninja
 who will be carrying the name of the Hokage!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki, remember that!
 Shut up!
 I'm prepared to do anything to become a Hokage!
 I will surpass the Hokage!
 And I will make all of the people in the village
 acknowledge my presence!
 He's always got such a one-track mind.
 Saying Hokage, Hokage all the time like a fool.
 I'm sorry, Naruto.
 It seems like...
 I don't want to...
 crush your unachievable dreams.
 That guy...
 Ibiki completely understands how the human psyche works.
 And the most horrifying part is...
 that by cornering people psychologically he controls their psyche and
 reveals the fundamental weakness of a human.
 Don't underestimate me! I won't run!
 I'll take it!
 But even if I'm stuck being a Genin forever,
 I will  become a Hokage no matter what it takes!
 I'm not scared!
 That guy, he wasn't even thinking of us at all.
 Such audacity!
 That's rightΓÇª
 That's exactly the kind of fool you are!
 I'll ask again.
 It's a choice that will alter your life.
 If you want to quit, now is your chance!
 I'm not going to take back my words!
 That is my Way of Ninja!
 Huh... What a funny kid.
 He completely brushed away those kids' anxieties.
 78, huh? Much more left than I expected.
 It's going to be the same. No matter how much more I push it.
 I like your determination!
 Then...
 For those who are still here...
 The first exam...
 You have passed it!
 Huh?
 H-Hey, what does that mean?
 All of a sudden you're telling us that we've passed!
 What about the 10th question?
 There wasn't such a thing to begin with!
 Well, you can look at the choice you just had to make as the 10th question!
 What?!
 Hey!
 Then, what were all those nine questions for!
 It was just a waste of time!
 Not a waste...
 The objective of the nine questions were already accomplished.
 To test your individual ability to gather information!
 Ability to gather information?
 FirstΓÇª
 The focus of this test was
 on the system of determining the pass or failure
 based on the three-person groups that was proposed in the first rule.
 By grading the exam on a group basis,
 I added the unimaginable pressure of dragging down your teammates.
 I see, I see.
 I kind of felt that was the point of this test!
 No , you didn't!
 However...
 The questions on these tests weren't things that
 you Genin Ninja would have been able to solve...
 So in that caseΓÇª
 I imagined that most of you here would have come to this conclusion:
 ""In order to score points, I'll have to cheat.""
 In other words,
 this exam was created under the premise that you all would cheat!
 That being said,
 I had two Chunin in the group who knew all of the answers
 from whom you could cheat.
 What?! That's what it was?
 I had a hard time figuring out the guy.
 Yeah. Really...
 It was so obvious!
 There's something wrong with you if you didn't notice!
 Right, Hinata?!
 He... didn't realize it...
 However...
 those who just foolishly cheated, naturally were disqualified.
 That's because...
 Information, depending on the time and situation,
 it will be more valuable than life.
 And in a mission or on a battlefield,
 you will always have to risk your life to fight for it!
 Horrible burn marks, nail punctures and scratches...
 Those are signs of physical torture!
 When information is gathered
 and the enemy or a third party finds out about it,
 that information is no longer guaranteed to be correct.
 Just remember this.
 To be given the wrong information
 can bring a catastrophic blow to your friends and town.
 So that is why, out of necessity, we forced you guys to cheat
 in order to test your ability to collect information.
 And we filtered out those who were clearly lacking in those abilities.
 But...
 The last question doesn't make any sense.
 However...
 this 10th question was the main issue of this first exam.
 Huh?
 What do you mean?
 I'll explain.
 The tenth question was to take on the question, or not.
 Needless to say, it is a painful decision to make.
 Those who chose not to take on the question,
 would be immediately failed along with their whole squad!
 Those who chose to answer the question and got it wrongΓÇª
 would be robbed of their chance to take the Exam forever.
 It really is an unfair question.
 Then, how about these two choices?
 Let's say that you guys did become a Chunin.
 The mission is to steal a secret document!
 You have no idea how many Ninjas the enemy has,
 their ability, and other armament they may have.
 On top of that, there maybe the pitfall of an enemy trap.
 Now this mission... Will you take it? Or not take it?
 Because you want your life spared...
 Because your partners will be put in danger...
 Can you get away from dangerous missions?
 The answer is...
 No!
 There are going to be missions you cannot avoid
 no matter how risky or dangerous it may be!
 Showing your courage to your teammates in a tight spot,
 and the ability to get through the hardships...
 This is the quality that is needed in a Chunin troop leader!
 In a pinch, there are those who cannot risk their own fate,
 and those who waver and give up their chances
 because they think they will have another chance.
 I believe that such fools who don't have strong determination
 have no right to become a Chunin!
 For those of you who chose to take on the question,
 you can say that you have successfully answered the difficult 10th question!
 You shall be able to take on the adversity that may lie in your way.
 You've passed through the gates!
 The fist exam for the Chunin Exam has been completed.
 I wish you well!
 All right! Wish us well!
 I did it! I did it! 					Yeaah!
 What a funny guy...
 W-What's going on?!
 Gosh, this one...
 You guys!
 This isn't the time to be celebrating!
 I'm the proctor for the second exam! Anko Mitarashi!
 Let's move onto the next stage! Next!
 Follow me!
 Read the atmosphere.
 This proctor... ls kind of like Naruto.
 78?! Ibiki! You let 26 teams slide by?
 I guess, the first exam this time around was too easy.
 It seems like this time, there are a lot of excellent candidates.
 Huh! Well, all right...
 I'll drop more than half of them in the second exam!
 M-More than half?
 I'm getting excited.
 I'll give you the details tomorrow.
 We'll be changing locations,
 so get information from your Jonin about the location and the time!
 That's it. You're dismissed.
 I didn't think that there would be a guy that would pass with a blank sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki... He really is a funny guy.
 W-What is this place?!
 NO TRESPASSING
 This is the location for the ""second exam"",
 the 44th Training Field.
 Also known as... the Forest of Death.
 The Forest of... Death?!
 I passed the first exam!
 I'm just going to hop, jump and take a big step and...
 Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?
 Hey, you guys!
 if you want to play a Ninja game...
 No? What? You came here for a mission?!
 Next episode: ""Special Report: 		Live from the Forest of Death!""
 As for me, I'm going to kick-butt again!

 Oh, long time no see.
 We donΓÇÖt have much time to get nostalgic.
 WeΓÇÖve got a mission.
 That I see over there is the Village of Artisans, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Yeah. ItΓÇÖs a village of professionals who develop Ninja tools.
 The exceptional Ninja tools they develop are also
 supplied to us in the Five Great NationsΓÇª
 But thereΓÇÖs been a strange rumor recently.
 A strange rumor?
 Something about them developing the ultimate weapon
 and attempting to antagonize the Five Great Nations.
 In other words, we should search the village andΓÇª
 verify whether or not there is that ultimate weapon, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs about the size of it.
 Piece of cake.
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, ΓÇ£See youΓÇªΓÇ¥
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if IΓÇÖm not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Hey! Something strange is going on.
 What is it?!
 ThereΓÇÖs not a soul in the village!
 I also found something terrible on top of that.
 What?!
 ItΓÇÖs that.
 The coffin of Seimei, the founder of the Village of Artisans.
 Even his body isΓÇª
 This is serious.
 The artisans abandoned their village. Where in the world did they go?
 The Targeted Shukaku
 IΓÇÖm hungry, IΓÇÖm hungry!
 Maybe IΓÇÖll treat myself and have two eggs in my ramen today.
 Huh?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on there?!
 Did I keep you waiting by any chance?
 Not really. I just got here a bit before.
 ThatΓÇÖs goodΓÇª Then, here.
 I made sure to hand it to you.
 Yeah, yeah. What a pain.
 Just a minute!
 WhatΓÇÖre you guys doingΓÇª
 all in secret in a place like this without even asking me?!
 ΓÇôNaruto? 					ΓÇôHuh?
 YouΓÇÖre terrible, just terrible, Sakura!
 Here you wonΓÇÖt even go out on a date with me at all!
 Why're you talking gibberish all of a sudden?
 Ouch-ouch-ouch-ouchΓÇª
 An errand for the Old Lady?
 Yes. It seems a new poison was discovered or something.
 I delivered a list of research medicinal substance
 for ShikamaruΓÇÖs father to prepare.
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs it?!
 Jeez, you jump to conclusions.
 Oh, come to think of it,
 an update report from Temari has been delivered to Lady Tsunade.
 An update report?
 So? What exactly?
 I heard that the Village Hidden in the Sand started Ninja education,
 imitating the curriculum program of the LeafΓÇÖs.
 It seems that Temari and her brothers are working as instructors.
 Instructors?!
 Is that harsh woman fit to be something like an instructorΓÇª?
 Really? That Gaara, huhΓÇª?
 This is hands-on training.
 Choose from among these a Ninja tool that suits you.
 What is it?
 Do we absolutely have to choose?!
 What do you mean?
 WeΓÇÖll end up hurting the other person if we use a weapon.
 We might kill them.
 A weapon isΓÇª
 No, never mindΓÇª
 A mission isnΓÇÖt a game.
 If you were to enter a field of battle with that frame of mind, you'd die.
 I-IΓÇÖm sorry.
 You got Gaara angry because you ask stupid questions.
 You are in trouble.
 The three of us will conduct hands-on training.
 Gather in the respective class of your choice.
 Gaara, put a smile on!
 They'll get scared and nobody will choose you with that sulky look.
 My dad said that Gaara was the SandΓÇÖs ultimate weapon.
 Yeah. He's so powerful that the village would be destroyed, if he got mad.
 HeΓÇÖs scary, so letΓÇÖs not bother.
 All right, IΓÇÖm with Temari.
 IΓÇÖll be with Kankuro!
 ΓÇô Me too! 					ΓÇô Me too!
 ΓÇô Me too! 					ΓÇô Me too!
 Please be my teacher.
 Earlier, he was trying to teach me somethingΓÇª
 Excuse meΓÇª Please be my teacher.
 Are you okay with me?
 Please teach me!
 This is cool.
 ThatΓÇÖs too big!
 IΓÇÖll take this.
 WhatΓÇÖs your name?
 IΓÇÖm Matsuri.
 Matsuri, choose a weapon.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 Come at me with that weapon with the intent to kill me.
 Yes, sirΓÇª
 They say an ogre with Iron Club is invincible. But you are no ogre.
 Yes, sir. Please tell me what I should choose.
 The weapon called the Rope Javelin.
 Rope JavelinΓÇª
 The sharp blade on the end of the rope
 is to keep an enemy out of one's reach, rather than for attack.
 And you seal off an enemyΓÇÖs movement with the rope.
 Practice until you can control it as a part of your body.
 Yes, sir!
 Damn. Who are you guys?!
 Is this all the Sand Village Shinobi have?
 Wait.
 Leave this guy alive. We can use him to draw that one out.
 Hang in there! What is it?! What happened?
 Take me to GaaraΓÇª Quickly.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 My mother and father were hit with countless weapons right in front of me.
 So IΓÇª
 For what purpose do you hold a weapon?
 HeΓÇª
 What areΓÇª
 ΓÇªthese two to you?!
 Th-These guys areΓÇª
 ΓÇªmy friends!
 Try laying so much as another finger on them!
 IΓÇÖll clobber you!
 He said that to me.
 ThatΓÇÖs what weΓÇÖre after: Gaara.
 Gaara, we were just coming to get you.
 The patrol Ninja was attacked by somebody.
 Guys calling themselves The Four Celestials
 brandishing strange weapons, said to tell Gaara thatΓÇª
 ""We declare a challenge to you, the ultimate weapon.
 ""If you donΓÇÖt accept the challenge,
 ""we will take away one person close to you every dayΓÇª
 ""and they shall pay the price for you.""
 You there.
 Are you GaaraΓÇÖs student?
 You shall be the first sacrifice.
 WhatΓÇÖs this Rope Javelin?!
 Wait!
 The enemy went northeastΓÇª
 Matsuri has become a first sacrificeΓÇª
 But the real target of the guys who call themselves the Four Celestials isΓÇª
 you, Gaara.
 YeahΓÇª
 This must be brought to a Jonin Council at onceΓÇª
 In the northeastern direction
 where the ones who call themselves the Four Celestials left,
 there is the Village Hidden in the Leaves of the Land of Fire,
 with the Land of Rivers sandwiched between.
 Therefore, we will be requesting the assistance of the LeafΓÇª
 Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.
 Form a unit and prepare for pursuit immediately.
 Hold it.
 The enemy is after Gaara.
 That would be like walking right into a trap they laid.
 ThatΓÇÖs right. Why wonΓÇÖt you send a party?!
 It might be a diversionary tactic by the enemy.
 The village will become shorthanded if we send out pursuers.
 Then you at least could come with us, right, Baki?!
 Most likely, the enemy is after Shukaku.
 Gaara is the SandΓÇÖs ultimate weapon.
 If we know thatΓÇª
 But it's also a dangerous double-edged sword to the village.
 If they would do us the favor facing each other and perishingΓÇª
 Then at least I should go with them.
 No. You have a different mission.
 Just send those three!
 Hey, how about it?!
 IΓÇÖve been given a different mission, you seeΓÇª
 Go. SheΓÇÖs your student, right?
 LetΓÇÖs go, Kankuro.
 Will it be okay with her?!
 SheΓÇÖs just a kid.
 Will he come?!
 If he doesnΓÇÖt come, weΓÇÖll just sacrifice those close to him one after another.
 That isΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs a message from the Sand Village!
 Gaara? Why?
 Who knows? The goal is a challenge to Gaara.
 The hostage is a Ninja school student.
 The enemy is escaping in the direction of the Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.
 Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are chasing after them.
 At this point, thatΓÇÖs all we know.
 You want me to set up an operation to stop the overconfident jerks
 who challenged Gaara just with that information?
 Yeah. WeΓÇÖre on friendly terms with the Sand Village, so.
 Just a minute.
 They came during the Sasuke incident with much less information than now.
 Things are more bothersome than that time!
 Our range would widen significantly if we ambushed them
 instead of pursuing them.
 ThereΓÇÖs also the incident in question in the Village of Artisans,
 and the Jonin and Chunin are all awayΓÇª
 ΓÇô ShizuneΓÇª 					ΓÇô Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 Those are the only Genin we can use now.
 Take the Genin you want to use
 and leave the village within thirty minutes!
 SakuraΓÇÖs name isnΓÇÖt on here.
 Yeah. SheΓÇÖs doing Medical Ninjutsu training now, so.
 IΓÇÖll accept the mission. But I have one condition.
 Please let me borrow Sakura.
 Sakura?
 ItΓÇÖs almost time! ls this everyone, Shikamaru?!
 One person still hasnΓÇÖt come.
 Could that beΓÇª?
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 I canΓÇÖt do a mission hungry. So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.
 What?! That's not fair just you getting to eat! I'll alsoΓÇª
 All right! Now weΓÇÖve got all our members together! WeΓÇÖre off!
 Huh? What? This is it?!
 I'd heard this was an operation with a mobilization
 of the Genin remaining in the village!
 This is everyone, I tell you!
 ThatΓÇÖs messed up!
 Setting aside Sakura whoΓÇÖs training,
 there should still be Shino, Neji and Hinata!
 No mistake. ItΓÇÖs weird Akamaru and I being the only Ninja
 with search ability.
 So is this team a go-for-it super attack-type?
 Yeah. I name us Team Return the Favor.
 What lame naming!
 The guys from the Sand Village helped us during the Sasuke incident!
 In a manner, this operation will be returning the favor from that time!
 All right! Guys, letΓÇÖs make sure to return the favor from that time.
 YouΓÇÖre not the leader!
 Shikamaru the Chunin is the leader of this platoon, right?!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 Jeez, then letΓÇÖs settle on a strategy and get going as soon as possible.
 Are we going in one line as we did for the Sasuke incident?
 ThereΓÇÖs no doubting the conditions are similar to the Sasuke incident.
 However, the strategies for pursuit and ambush are completely different!
 We canΓÇÖt follow them with Byakugan or by using AkamaruΓÇÖs nose.
 No mistake about that.
 ItΓÇÖs unconventional, but since these are all the people weΓÇÖve got,
 weΓÇÖll act in groups of two basis as Two-Man Cells.
 Solo action is prohibited no matter what the case!
 We owe a debt to the Ninja in the Sand Village.
 However, although this is to repay a debt, no way will we produce casualties!
 Yeah, I got it.
 ΓÇô Follow me, Ino. 					ΓÇô Right!
 Choji, you go with KibaΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.
 RightΓÇª
 Lee, youΓÇÖre with NarutoΓÇª
 Right. Please refrain from selfish actions.
 You donΓÇÖt need to remind me like that.
 Also, the four people Naruto mentioned earlier have left before us.
 Four people, do you mean Shino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?
 Yeah. The four will be going their separate ways
 and wonΓÇÖt take part in future battles!
 Why not?!
 IsnΓÇÖt that an incredible waste of battle strength?!
 In place of that, we get a wider range of search actionΓÇª
 And weΓÇÖll have them focus on medical action in the case of battle starting.
 I have been entrusted with your lives and this is my strategy!
 All right, just wait, Gaara!
 IΓÇÖll make sure to return the favor!
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 One of the enemies uses wind, huh? lnteresting. I will be her opponent!
 Then IΓÇÖll take on the guy who brandishes the sword that looks like a kidΓÇÖs toy.
 WeΓÇÖll take care of this. You go ahead, Gaara.
 But, will it be okay?
 We donΓÇÖt need your help to deal with these chumps.
 You hurry, Gaara. That girl is your student, isnΓÇÖt she?

 Naruto.
 Have you already resumed studies at the academy?
 N-No, not yet.

 Is that so?
 How about you, Naruto? YouΓÇÖre already training?
 Sort of.
 Wh-What?
 What is it?
 N-No, itΓÇÖs nothingΓÇª

 ThereΓÇÖs no time to be feeling lonely.
 Everyone is working really hard to rebuild the village right now.
 KonohamaruΓÇª
 Right now, I must work for the village even just a little bit.
 So Naruto, you work hard at your training too.
 If you donΓÇÖt, IΓÇÖll become Hokage before you.
 Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.
 BesidesΓÇªyou have to graduate from the Academy first.
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 Oh, here it is.
 Here, itΓÇÖs for you.

 Is it okay?
 I already have one, so IΓÇÖm giving one to you.
 Thank you, Naruto.

 Good morning.
 IΓÇÖm going to go.
 WeΓÇÖll work hard again today.
 ΓÇô Yep! 					ΓÇô Yep!
 Today weΓÇÖre fixing the blackboards.

 OrochimaruΓÇª or someone like Kabuto played KazekageΓÇª
 How thoughtless we wereΓÇª
 That darn SarutobiΓÇª
 Well, itΓÇÖs not that easy.
 The one who was your opponent was the renowned Hokage,
 deemed to be strongest of all five great nations.
 HoweverΓÇªyouΓÇÖve done well. Two out of the five KagesΓÇª
 StopΓÇª
 Stop giving me words of sympathy.
 I will kill you!
 Of course, I didnΓÇÖt mean toΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs true that we didnΓÇÖt succeed in bringing the village downΓÇª
 On the other hand, another objective of this plan, Sasuke UchihaΓÇª
 Your leash is now on him.
 In exchange for these arms and all of my JutsuΓÇª
 If we could have gotten our hands on that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,
 it wouldnΓÇÖt have been a problem.
 However thatΓÇÖs a dream that can no longer come true.
 He is stronger than I am.
 That is whyΓÇªI pulled myself out from that organizationΓÇª
 Kakashi, huh?
 What does he want?
 Breakfast, breakfast!
 Wait for me, my ramen.
 Do you already know his whereabouts?
 Yes.
 In that case, it will be easyΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 Here it comes, here it comes.
 Oh goodie, itΓÇÖs just like I thought.
 Hidden Leaf VillageΓÇª has a high average score.
 YouΓÇÖre still doing such a ridiculous thing?
 Well yes, this is my research.
 Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?
 I wonder what you advisers want from me.
 Surely, you knowΓÇª
 without our telling you, donΓÇÖt you?
 You donΓÇÖt have to make such scary faces.
 I heard that the talks with Sand Village have been settled without problems.
 The Hidden Village in the Sand announced that
 everything was OrochimaruΓÇÖs handiwork.
 In addition, at the moment of their complete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,
 that wasnΓÇÖt a very important issue any more.
 Leaf Village has no choice but to accept their surrender and proposition
 in order to restore national power.
 However, the current strength of Leaf Village has dropped drastically.
 Under these conditions,
 our top priority must be to prepare for any unpredicted crisis.
 We donΓÇÖt know when any of the neighboring nations
 will come out in a bold move.
 Therefore, weΓÇÖve decided that until the village gets its strength back,
 we should assemble the top few men from each troop,
 and form an emergency executive committee to handle this.
 But firstΓÇª
 we need a strong, trustworthy leader.
 You can find the seeds of trouble rolling around everywhere these days.
 ItΓÇÖs not just Orochimaru.
 You didnΓÇÖt have to go through the trouble of informing me that.
 WellΓÇª IΓÇÖll continue gathering materials.
 IΓÇÖm going to tell you the basic plan.
 We need the Fifth Hokage right away.
 And yesterday at an emergency meeting with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,
 we decided it would be you, Jiraiya.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, itΓÇÖs not my nature.
 It has been decided.
 Besides, if a Shinobi like you, renowned as a Sannin, is notΓÇª
 then who is?
 If you want a Sannin, there is one more leftΓÇª
 That Tsunade.
 Certainly that child probably has that capability, butΓÇª
 However, no one knows where she is.
 IΓÇÖll find and bring her back. lf I do that thereΓÇÖs no problem, right?
 ButΓÇª
 A wise one like Tsunade is meant to be Hokage more than I, with no motivation.
 What do you want to do?
 All right. WeΓÇÖll give it urgent consideration.
 However, weΓÇÖll have three members from Anbu Black Ops to accompany you
 as the search unit for Tsunade.
 DonΓÇÖt worry, I wonΓÇÖt escape from this. The guards are not necessary.
 HoweverΓÇª
 There is one guy that I want to take with me on my trip.
 IΓÇÖve found an interesting eggΓÇª
 What? That is absolutely strange.
 Sorry, but if you donΓÇÖt have a ticket, thereΓÇÖs no ramen.
 No, wait a minute! I absolutely had one more.
 Huh?
 The one that I gave Konohamaru, was it the last?
 Welcome!
 Hey, my ramen!
 ""Racy Violence""
 Yo, you two!
 You seem to be getting along well.
 Fool, Anko asked me to buy rice dumplings. ThatΓÇÖs all.
 What are you doing here?
 While IΓÇÖm here to buy offerings, IΓÇÖve made plans to meet hereΓÇª
 with Sasuke.
 Huh, itΓÇÖs rare that you wait for people.
 Is the offering to Obito?
 Obito?
 WellΓÇªthatΓÇÖs about right.
 Kakashi, itΓÇÖs strange for you to be here first.
 WellΓÇª once in a while.
 I donΓÇÖt do natto (fermented beans) and sweet things.
 OhΓÇª Is that so?
 What?!
 This is absolutely positively strange!
 You guys arenΓÇÖt from the villageΓÇª Why in the world did you come?
 I havenΓÇÖt seen you for a while Asuma, Kurenai.
 If you know about us, are you former Leaf Shinobi?
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 Y-You are?!
 Humph, without a doubtΓÇª
 ItachiΓÇª
 Uchiha.
 You are acquaintances of Itachi?
 If soΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll introduce myself as well.
 IΓÇÖm Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.
 Never mind later, IΓÇÖm going to beat you now!
 ItachiΓÇª
 It seems youΓÇÖre pretty unpopular in the village too.
 I know you, too.
 Kisame Hoshigake,
 originally a Shinobi of Hidden Village in the Mist.
 Suspected of national covert activities and of killing a feudal lord,
 a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water, on the wanted list in all nations.
 YouΓÇÖre a major S-rank criminal listed in the Bingo Book.
 Itachi, you have some nerve coming back to this village
 after causing that awful incident.
 AsumaΓÇª KurenaiΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt interfere with me.
 I donΓÇÖt intend to kill you.
 ThatΓÇÖs not a line for you, who killed your comrades.
 I know thereΓÇÖs no way youΓÇÖd come here
 without any clear purpose in those suspicious appearance.
 What are you after?
 This guy is pretty annoying. Should we kill him?
 It doesnΓÇÖt look like we are able to leave the village so smoothlyΓÇª
 But donΓÇÖt overdo it, your techniques tend to stand out.
 They're done for then.
 This isΓÇª
 Genjutsu.
 Pressing down with the tip of his swordΓÇª What strength.
 My large sword, Shark SkinΓÇª
 doesnΓÇÖt cut, but lops it off!
 KurenaiΓÇª YouΓÇÖre late.
 With thisΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs over!
 Genjutsu of that level doesnΓÇÖt work on me.
 This isΓÇªGenjutsu Reversal?
 Kurenai!
 ThereΓÇÖs no time to look away.
 ThatΓÇÖs whatΓÇÖs expected from you, Kurenai.
 ButΓÇª
 ΓÇ£ButΓÇ¥ this is as far as it goesΓÇª
 for you.
 What?!
 Water Style!
 ΓÇô Water Shark Bomb Jutsu! ΓÇô Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 WellΓÇªI asked you to take care of them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 Shadow clones.
 KakashiΓÇª
 Hatake.
 CripesΓÇª So much fuss for nothing.
 IΓÇª
 I put it under my headband
 in order not to drop the important ticket during morning training.
 Okay, thatΓÇÖs fineΓÇª Eat well and do your best.
 Hmm?
 YouΓÇÖre going to do it again after this, right? Training?
 Of course! IΓÇÖm full of motivation.
 Good! Here you go.
 Another serving for free! Go for it!
 Thank you, sir!
 Welcome.
 Just like I heardΓÇª I had to come and see it.
 It seems that you really are just eating ramen.
 Oh, Pervy Sage!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Itachi UchihaΓÇª
 who became a leader of Anbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen
 and who destroyed the Uchiha clan single-handedly.
 I donΓÇÖt know why he has suddenly appeared after all this timeΓÇª
 But I donΓÇÖt think we will allow him to leave so easily.
 What is your purpose?!

183,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Wait, Naruto!
 I wonΓÇÖt wait.
 I told you not to be acting on your own.
 Then youΓÇÖre saying to leave Sumaru be?!
 Sumaru just now seemed quite upsetΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs definitely intending to get revenge on Akahoshi.
 Now that heΓÇÖs been tarred with the reputation of Rogue Ninja,
 heΓÇÖll have no place to go throughout his life
 if he raises a hand against the village leader.
 Hokuto?
 Mother!
 I finallyΓÇª
 Here, I finally got to meet youΓÇª
 Mother.
 The Star's Radiance
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖre you doing?
 Shh! DonΓÇÖt be acting on your own anymore.
 But, somethingΓÇÖs strange.
 This number of Ninja is indeed something serious.
 It seems theyΓÇÖve mobilized all of the village Ninja.
 Anyway, we should see how things go for a little while.
 Byakugan!
 SumaruΓÇÖs inside the training roomΓÇª
 Hey, what about SumaruΓÇÖs mom?
 Damn it!
 SumaruΓÇª
 Do we really have to do away with him?
 HeΓÇÖs still a kid. WouldnΓÇÖt it be okay to let things slide?
 At this moment, heΓÇÖs a dangerous element.
 No good would come of letting him live.
 But SumaruΓÇÖs been the most effective Genin in the village.
 We have more than enough materialsΓÇª
 We can just train moreΓÇª
 MaterialsΓÇª?!
 I wonΓÇÖt stand for it anymore! Leave it to me!
 ΓÇô Forget about it. ΓÇô Let go of me!
 IΓÇÖm going to kick that Akahoshi jerkΓÇÖs butt.
 This is a Star Village issue.
 Village issues have to be resolved by those in the village.
 IsnΓÇÖt there something we can do for him?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 LetΓÇÖs charge on in and box AkahoshiΓÇÖs earsΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 ThatΓÇÖd be the same as Naruto!
 Are you saying we must remain idle spectators
 even when things have gone this far?!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 As long as thereΓÇÖs no commission from the village to kick AkahoshiΓÇÖs butt,
 thereΓÇÖs nothing we can do.
 Archer unit! Forward!
 Fire!
 Until now, I felt resentment towards you, Mother, for leaving me behind.
 ButΓÇªI understand clearly now.
 I understand why you had to do that.
 AkahoshiΓÇª I will never forgive him!
 SumaruΓÇª
 Wh-What a pitiful mother and son, eh?!
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking aboutΓÇª?
 I buried them both togetherΓÇª There is no greater happiness.
 Incredible Chakra!
 Wait!
 This jerkΓÇÖs an enemy... He suddenly attacked.
 YouΓÇÖre Leaf Shinobi, right?
 I can tell even if you give me the runaroundΓÇª
 The people from other lands are all after the star.
 If you have that power,
 you can stand above all of the Hidden Villages.
 Is your awesome Chakra also the power of the star?
 If they had that star,
 would everyone have the same Chakra as you?
 No! The more tremendous the power,
 the more hard work is required to control it!
 IΓÇÖll work hard, work hard, work hard!
 IΓÇÖll become the Hoshikage!
 Yeah! I look forward to working with you at that time!
 IΓÇÖm also going to become the Hokage someday, believe it!
 YouΓÇÖre a strange guy.
 Really?
 That red star sure is prettyΓÇª
 NatsuhiboshiΓÇª
 It watches over me all the timeΓÇª
 Are you still gonna say I should bear it after all this?
 Sumaru!
 SumaruΓÇª
 Listen, everyone.
 If you continue the star training, youΓÇÖll all die.
 SumaruΓÇÖs mother is the one who took away the star.
 She did that in order to protect everyoneΓÇÖs lives!
 Lord Akahoshi?
 Is it true that weΓÇÖll die?
 Are you going to believe such nonsense?!
 Being unable to withstand the star training
 is because the heart that loves the village is weak!
 Those who really love the village can become true Shinobi
 and can also surpass the Hidden Villages of the Five Great Nations!
 Hokuto or Lord AkahoshiΓÇª WhoΓÇÖs telling the truth?
 Mizura?!
 In that conditionΓÇª! ltΓÇÖs reckless!
 Wait, everyone!
 ThereΓÇÖsΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs something I want everyone to see.
 MizuraΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 Is that the effect of the training?
 How awful.
 Lord AkahoshiΓÇª I take pride in the Hidden Star Village.
 Even though it was painful,
 I endured it and continued the star trainingΓÇª
 Even so, were my feelings for the village still not enough?
 Mizura!
 I donΓÇÖt think there could be lies in that childΓÇÖs wordsΓÇªand body.
 Yes. So thatΓÇÖs why the Third Hoshikage prohibited
 the star training for a long while.
 We adults got carried away with our feelings for the village
 and may have made the wrong choiceΓÇª
 You loser!
 Do you intend to mislead everyone and crush the village?!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Akahoshi?!
 They arenΓÇÖt traitors.
 TheyΓÇÖre children of our village!
 Protect Hokuto and Mizura.
 Are you going to betray the village?!
 I canΓÇÖt go along with your way of doing things, Lord Akahoshi!
 Me, too.
 Me, too!
 Me, too.
 Me, too.
 Death to those who betray the village!
 Execute them all!
 Are you insane, Akahoshi?
 If we lost all the children, thereΓÇÖd be no future for the village!
 H-HeyΓÇª YouΓÇÖre taking things too far, Akahoshi.
 Take everyoneΓÇÖs feelings into consideration and yield for now.
 Shut up! WhatΓÇÖre you doing talking nice now?
 WeΓÇÖve long since dirtied our hands.
 S-Stop! WhatΓÇÖre you going to say?
 Akahoshi, what do you mean?
 ThereΓÇÖs a star in this village that no other villages possess.
 I just thought we didnΓÇÖt need a foolish village leader
 who wouldnΓÇÖt allow the star to be used.
 What?!
 Could it be that you are the ones who killed the Third Hoshikage?!
 Indeed, there were suspicious rumors concerning the Third HoshikageΓÇÖs death.
 Akahoshi, prepare yourself and answer!
 YouΓÇÖll pay depending on your answer.
 The three of us assassinated the Third Hoshikage!
 It was the quickest way to save the village.
 Say what?!
 You guys are the traitors!
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Right! Right!
 No, donΓÇÖt get the wrong idea.
 We just helped a little.
 Idiot. ThatΓÇÖll be an acknowledgement!
 Akahoshi!
 We will not acknowledge you as leader of the village.
 Justice is not with you anymore.
 It is the children who possess the hearts that truly care about the village.
 Everyone! Let us rise together with those children
 for the sake of the village.
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 WeΓÇÖre sorry, children.
 We were completely taken in by AkahoshiΓÇÖs fast-talk.
 As of now, weΓÇÖll fight with you!
 Give it up, Akahoshi.
 WeΓÇÖve lost!
 Shut up! I havenΓÇÖt lost.
 Mizura!
 HokutoΓÇª Live for meΓÇª
 Mizura!
 Akahoshi, we wonΓÇÖt let you do as you please anymore!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do something like go against me!
 Have you gone mad?!
 Akahoshi, youΓÇÖve lost!
 Give in to justice with good grace!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose!
 The star is nowΓÇªin my hands!
 The star?!
 I will now become the Fourth Hoshikage!
 PowerΓÇª IΓÇÖm starting to brim with power.
 I do not need any training.
 I could have become one with the star if IΓÇÖd done this from the start..
 WhatΓÇªWhatΓÇÖs this?
 WhatΓÇÖs that?!
 Byakugan.
 Massive Chakra from the star has poured into his Chakra Network
 and is causing it to go out of control.
 Hokuto!
 I canΓÇÖt take it anymore! Neji! Hey, Neji!
 DonΓÇÖtΓÇª NarutoΓÇª
 No matter what you say, IΓÇÖll kick that Akahoshi jerkΓÇÖs butt!

 Despite having been assigned a mission to protect the star,
 to think youΓÇÖd smash the all-important starΓÇª
 You didnΓÇÖt just fail to complete the mission!
 The compensation fee will be massive.
 But Grandma, I had no other choice!
 ItΓÇÖs my fault as the leader for not being able to stop him.
 IΓÇÖm responsible as well!
 Right. I alsoΓÇª
 Well, thatΓÇÖd be a matter under normal circumstances.
 We havenΓÇÖt received complaints from the Star Village
 with regard to the incident of the star being smashed.
 In fact, the culprit of this incident
 was the client Akahoshi, the deputy Hoshikage.
 So the mission itself is forgotten!
 Come to think of it, what happened to him?
 It seems the three,
 the main culprit Akahoshi and accomplices Yotaka and Shisou,
 will be punished severely by Hidden Star Village!
 ThatΓÇÖs good! Now the Star Village will be peaceful.
 Come in.
 Lady Tsunade, all the Genin from the Star Village have been examined.
 AndΓÇª?
 If they all receive proper treatment, they will return to good health.
 Hey, what about Mizura?
 Yes. That boy will also be fine.
 Yes! So, whereΓÇÖs everyone?
 TheyΓÇÖve completed their examinations and are heading for their quarters.
 Hey, Naruto! The lecture isnΓÇÖtΓÇª
 He never changes.
 Hey, guys.
 ThatΓÇÖs great! Get better, Mizura.
 Right!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose to you.
 Huh, what?!
 IΓÇÖll become Hoshikage before you!
 Even without the power of the star,
 IΓÇÖll make the Village Hidden in the Stars into a most powerful Ninja village!
 Say what?
 No way will I lose! IΓÇÖll become Hokage before you!
 Shut up. IΓÇÖll be first.
 IΓÇÖll be first, believe it!

 I can see him!
 Well, well.

 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

 I'm totally late!
 Well, wellΓÇª It seems my prediction was right on the money.
 Prediction?
 That little mask...
 Oh!

 Don't come out! Get out of here, quick!

 So you're just gonna cry all day like the lead in a tragedy?
 An idiot like you can just cry forever! You crybaby!
 He's probably tired of crying.
 So, he knows the true meaning of the word strong.
 Like your father.
 For the things I truly hold dear to myselfΓÇª
 I protect them until the end with both these arms,

 I don't want to have to kill youΓÇª
 I'd like for you to back down.
 NonsenseΓÇª
 I knew itΓÇª
 But you won't be able to keep up  with my speed.
 Also, I've already made two preemptive moves.
 Two preemptive moves?
 The first one is the scattered water.
 And the second one was blocking one of your handsΓÇª
 Therefore, you'll just be able to defend my attackΓÇª
 What?! With one hand he'sΓÇª?!

 I've never seen such a thing beforeΓÇª

 So he doesn't want to kill himΓÇªeh.
 I wonder if that's how he really feelsΓÇª

 In the forest, there was a boar that had been cut-up with a sword.
 Other than that, there were trees with lots of cuts.
 They headed in the direction of your houseΓÇª

 I see.

 You're surprisingly stupidΓÇª
 From here onΓÇª you'll only defend my attack!
 To think Haku would lose in speedΓÇª
 It seems that I'm faster than youΓÇª
 I can't have you mocking our team, calling them bratsΓÇª

 You're strong!

 Now you'll laugh at me again and call me a crybaby.

 Now then. I can leave the rest to you, right?

 If they find us, we'll be in deep trouble.
 Mr. Tazuna.
 I want to ask you something before we arrive at the pier.
 The identity of your assailants, and the reason why they are after you.
 If you don't tell usΓÇª
 our mission may end when you make landfall.
 The Assassin of the Mist
 It appears I have no choice but to tell you.
 Frankly, I'd like you to listen.
 Just as you said,
 this may be beyond the scope of your mission.
 Actually, I am being targeted by a terrifying man.
 A terrifying man?
 Who?
 You guys have probably heard at  least his name before.
 A shipping magnate by the name of Gato.
 What? GatoΓÇªof the Gato Company?
 One of the world's richest men?
 Who? What?
 YesΓÇª
 On the surface, he's the chief executive of a shipping companyΓÇª
 But underneath, he is into drug-trafficking
 and deals in contraband using gangs and Ninjas.
 Moreover, he runs a despicable business,
 ruthlessly taking over nations and enterprises.
 It was about one year agoΓÇª
 when that man first set his eyes on the Land of the WavesΓÇª
 He used his wealth and violence to enter this country,
 and before anyone knew it,
 he had taken complete control of the island's maritime transportation and shipping.
 Having a tight grip on the ocean, in an island nation like the Land of the Waves,
 means having control of finance, the government, the people... everything.
 The one thing Gato fears...
 is the completion of the bridge...
 that has been under construction for some time now.
 I see.
 Since you're the one building the bridge, you've become a hindrance.
 Then, those Ninjas from before were Gato's menΓÇª?
 But I don't understand.
 Your opponent is a dangerous one,  who will even use Ninja.
 Why did you hide that fact from us when you made your request?
 The Land of the WavesΓÇª
 is a very poor nation, and even feudal lords have no money.
 Of course, we ordinary citizens have no money either.
 We cannot afford to make requests of Rank B or higher...
 Well, if you pull out of the mission when I land ashore,
 I will, no doubt, be killed.
 Killed sometime before I make it home.
 But there's no need for concern!
 Should I die, my cute grandchild who will turn eight...
 will only cry his heart out!
 Oh!
 And... my daughter will only blame the Hidden Leaves Ninja
 for the rest of her life and grieve in solitude!
 Oh, it's not your fault at all!
 Well...
 I guess we have no choice.
 Let's continue as his bodyguards.
 Oh! I am most grateful!
 I won!
 We'll be arriving soon.
 Tazuna.
 It appears we haven't been noticed up until this pointΓÇª
 Thanks.
 This is as far as I go.
 See you around.
 Yeah. You've been a big help.
 Be careful.
 Okay!
 Get me home safely.
 Right.
 When they next attack, it won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin.
 Cripes!
 I won't let this guy do all the fun stuff anymore!
 There!
 HehΓÇª Just a mouse.
 Quit trying to show off!
 There was nothing there  in the first place!
 Please, Naruto.
 Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly.
 They're really dangerous.
 Hey brat! Don't be doing anything confusing!
 Huh? I sense a presence there!
 No, over here?!
 There!
 Stop it, already!
 S-Someone's really been targeting us  the whole time!
 Yeah right!
 Knock it off, you!
 Naruto! What have you done?!
 It's a bunny!
 I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean toΓÇª I'm sorry, bunny.
 It's just a rabbit, eh.
 That's a snow rabbit.
 But that doesn't explain its fur color...
 The coat turns white only during winter when there is little sunlight.
 Which means...
 that snow rabbit was raised indoors without sunlight to be used as a substitution.
 Guess they're already hereΓÇª
 I'm sorryΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª The Demon Brothers wouldn't be enough to take on these guys.
 The Copy Ninja from the Village of the Hidden Leaves.
 ""Sharingan"" Kakashi is with themΓÇª
 Everyone, get down!
 If I'm not mistaken, he'sΓÇª
 Here we go!
 Here we go, here we go, here we go!
 I'm going to do it this time.
 I won't lose to Sasuke!
 Well, well.
 If it isn't the Rogue Ninja of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi!
 Rogue Ninja? Whatever. What's important now isΓÇª
 ReadyΓÇª
 Go!
 You're in the way.
 Get back, you guys.
 Why?!
 He's on a totally different level from the guys from the other day.
 His being our opponent meansΓÇª
 Huh?
 Oh.
 that things might be tricky as I am now.
 I assume you are Kakashi, the Sharingan userΓÇª
 Sorry, butΓÇª
 I'll have you hand over the old man.
 Huh? Huh? Sharingan? What's that?
 What? What is he talking about?
 Is this guy strong?
 SharinganΓÇª
 Get in Manji battle formation, you guys.
 Protect TazunaΓÇª
 Don't involve yourselves in the fight.
 Huh?
 That's the teamwork in this situation.
 Huh?!
 Fight me.
 W-What's this eyeΓÇª?
 Well now...
 I never expected to see the rumored Sharingan this soonΓÇª
 This is an honor.
 Everyone's been saying Sharingan...
 What is it?!
 ΓÇªSharingan.
 Power that the light of the eye generates, and the pupil emanates.
 The user of the so-called Visual Jutsu (Art)
 is said to possess the vision to see through all Genjutsu (Illusionary Art),
 Taijutsu (Physical Art), and Ninjutsu (Ninja Art),
 and is able to deflect them.
 The Sharingan is a type of eye that is unique
 to the user of the Visual Art.
 However, that is not the only power of the Sharingan.
 Well said.
 That is not all.
 What's more frightening is that such an eye
 can assess an opponent's techniques and copy them.
 When I was in the Anbu Black Ops of the Hidden Mist,
 search information about you was in the Bingo Book
 I would carry around with me.
 There was also something else in the book...
 About the man who has copied over one thousand skillsΓÇª
 Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 What? Kakashi Sensei is that incredible a Ninja?
 W-Wow!
 What does this mean?
 The SharinganΓÇªis a special trait
 that appears in only a select few even among the Uchiha clan.
 Could it be, that this guyΓÇª
 Let's end the talking here.
 I must kill that old man immediately.
 But, Kakashi, it seems I have to defeat you first.
 Over there!
 And he's even on the water?
 He's building up quite a bit of Chakra!
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu.
 He's vanished?!
 Sensei!
 He'll probably come to erase me firstΓÇª
 What is he?
 Zabuza Momochi.
 He's a Anbu Black Ops member in the Hidden Mist and
 is known as ""the silent killing"" technique expert.
 S-Silen...?
 As the name suggestsΓÇª
 it's a killing skill that's implemented in an instant in silence.
 By the time you realize it,
 it's possible you may find yourself in the afterlife.
 I haven't totally mastered the use of my Sharingan.
 So don't lower your guard, you guys.
 Well, if we fail, we'll only die.
 How can you be so carefree?!
 The mist is steadily getting thicker!
 The Land of the Waves is surrounded by ocean.
 So mist rises very easily.
 Sensei!
 Eight spots.
 Huh? What?
 The larynx, the spine, the lungs, the liver...
 The jugular and the subclavian veins.
 The kidneys, the heart.
 Now then, which vulnerable spot would be good?
 What an intense thirst for blood!
 If I take even one breath, or move my eyes,
 I will be marked and killed - that's what I'm feeling.
 If I'm stuck like this for an hour, I'll go mad!
 Facing a Jonin's intent to killΓÇª
 This sensation is like having my life being held in limboΓÇª
 No way! I'd rather die to escape this feeling!
 Sasuke.
 Don't worry. I'll protect you with my life.
 I will not allow my comrades to get killed.
 I wonder about that...
 It's over.
 Sensei! 					Behind you!
 Die!
 The Water Clone Jutsu?
 It can't be!
 In this mistΓÇª
 did he actually copy me?
 Don't move.
 It's over.
 O-Oh no!
 Even Kakashi Sensei fell under Zabuza's Jutsu.
 I've got to escape.
 I'll get killed, for real.
 This pain.
 What am I doing?!
 I'd decided, hadn't I? Not to run away no matter what happens.
 Next episode:  ""The Oath of Pain!""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

 No mistakeΓÇª
 Thanks to you Mister Naruto, all of the postal articles are safe.
 By the way, whatΓÇÖs a Delivery Ninja?
 We are postal professionals who risk our lives
 to deliver the important parcels our customers have left with us.
 In other words, youΓÇÖre a postman.
 I am a Delivery Ninja!
 Ordinary postmen donΓÇÖt risk their lives.
 So youΓÇÖre an awesome postman, huh?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Oops, I must not keep my customers waiting.
 Then, IΓÇÖll be on my wayΓÇª
 Mister! WhatΓÇÖs your name?!
 IΓÇÖm 596-03.

 Am I?
 Ah, Pervy Sage!
 What?! WhoΓÇÖs a Pervy SageΓÇª?!
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this, Pervy Sage?!
 HadnΓÇÖt you left the village on an important mission?
 ThatΓÇÖs why I was being patient about you training with me!
 If youΓÇÖve got the free time to be doing something like this,
 help out with my training right now!
 W-Wait, Naruto. ThereΓÇÖs a reason for thisΓÇª
 You probably have some glib lies about gathering information or something.
 YouΓÇÖre wrong, youΓÇÖre wrong. ltΓÇÖs data collection, data collectionΓÇª
 You seeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs my final spurt
 for the manuscript of the final volume of ΓÇ£Make-Out Violence.ΓÇ¥
 What about the missionΓÇª?
 Well, you see, IΓÇÖm on a mission.
 So donΓÇÖt worryΓÇª
 What kind of mission?
 As it happens, I received information that a member of the Akatsuki Organization
 will be visiting this town the day after tomorrow.
 The Akatsuki Organization! Then, that Itachi will beΓÇª?
 I donΓÇÖt know that. And the same goes for their purposeΓÇª
 But thatΓÇÖs a matter until the day after tomorrow.
 And so, IΓÇÖm making effective use of the free time!
 Then itΓÇÖs perfect. Give me some training!
 WellΓÇª you see, theyΓÇÖre so insistent about the manuscript.
 I ended up promising the publisher that IΓÇÖd send it today or tomorrow.
 Come on! ItΓÇÖs a long-awaited chance for training.
 If my manuscript were to be completed early,
 I might be able to take some time for training.
 Oh, my shoulders are stiff!
 There, there.
 Oh, IΓÇÖm thirsty!
 Here you go.
 Hot!
 Hey, the ideas I just about had have blown away!
 Enough!
 IΓÇÖm taking a bath!
 What a hard Sensei to pleaseΓÇª
 I bet heΓÇÖs going to say this is data collection, anyway.
 We must deliver that secret document
 to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs, no matter what the costΓÇª
 It seems this is where the Delivery Ninjas always stay.
 Oh, they couldΓÇª

 IΓÇÖm a writer rooted in realism! Getting a picture is important.

 Can you write if I do that?
 IΓÇÖll write, IΓÇÖll write!

 I will take it for you.
 Ow-ow-owΓÇª
 Excuse me, can I also ask you to take this for me?
 Oh! Mister Naruto. Thank you for helping me out yesterday.
 Oh! Mister!
 I am 596-03.
 ItΓÇÖs hard to remember!
 More importantly, I want to ask you to take care of this!
 HmmΓÇªThis goes in a different directionΓÇª
 Have a heart. Please.
 Oh, perfect timing.
 Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone?
 He is 463-72.
 This area should be in your jurisdiction.
 It is.
 Then I leave it to youΓÇª What was it again?
 I am 463-72.
 Hurry, okay?
 Wake upΓÇª
 Whoa! I fell asleep!
 Pervy Sage, letΓÇÖs start training!
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about? I must complete the manuscriptΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt need to worry about that.
 I wrote the manuscript and sent it to the publisher!
 So now you can devote yourself freely to trainingΓÇª
 Right, Pervy Sage?
 You idiot!
 Huh?
 If something like this were read, itΓÇÖll be the end of my writing career!
 AhΓÇª OhΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorry.
 You said you sent it to the publisher, right? How?
 I gave it to a Delivery Ninja in the innΓÇª
 D-Delivery Ninjas.
 You mean, the one that delivers any parcel to the addressee, no matter whatΓÇª
 not influenced by any land or institutionΓÇª that iron organization?!
 After him, Naruto.
 WeΓÇÖll chase down the Delivery Ninja, no matter whatΓÇª
 and retrieve your manuscript at any cost!
 If heΓÇÖs going to the publisher, he should definitely take this path.
 Now whatΓÇÖs left is how to close the time gapΓÇª
 I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjas is extraordinary, thoughΓÇª
 Pervy Sage!
 Slow down the pace a little, man.
 Naruto! This is also training!
 To be straight, youΓÇÖre short on leg power!
 A Ninja must apply oneself,
 connecting this with training, no matter what the situation!
 Excellent, Pervy Sage. Now youΓÇÖre talking!
 ItΓÇÖs just like a maze!
 WeΓÇÖre totally lostΓÇª
 If we had HinataΓÇÖs or NejiΓÇÖs Byakugan at a time like thisΓÇª
 Byakugan! I didnΓÇÖt think of that!
 ThatΓÇÖs the Rasengan, isnΓÇÖt it?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry!
 Uh, no, you seeΓÇª!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be drooling!
 There he is!
 After him, Naruto.
 R-Right!
 Thieves!
 Hey, wait!
 ThereΓÇÖs no fool whoΓÇÖd wait after being told to wait!
 As it happens,
 the parcel this person here left with you this morning is a slip-up!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 I have no knowledge of that.
 The rule for us Delivery Ninjas
 is to deliver parcels once left with us to the destination,
 even if we have to risk our lives!
 My life as a writer is also at risk!
 DonΓÇÖt look at me.
 This is trouble!
 Sorry.
 To do that to someone whoΓÇÖs doing honest workΓÇª
 Shut up! When you get right down to it, it was you whoΓÇª
 Huh?! WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 This isnΓÇÖt the thing you wrote!
 Oh!
 That time! It got switched with my manuscript!
 Say what?!
 This isΓÇªa secret document directed
 to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs from the Land of ClawsΓÇª
 Let me seeΓÇª According to the information IΓÇÖve gotten,
 the Fang and the Claw could go to war at any momentΓÇª
 This is a secret document for peace!
 TheyΓÇÖve decided on peace?! ltΓÇÖs written here.
 ThatΓÇÖs a good thing, isnΓÇÖt it?! War is no good!
 You! You idiot! The fact that this secret document is here means
 the manuscript you wrote is being taken to the Land of Fangs!
 WhatΓÇÖll happen if they read it as a secret document
 from the Land of Claws?
 This is bad! No doubt, war will begin!
 WeΓÇÖre going to the Land of Fangs!
 R-Right!
 This time for sure weΓÇÖll take back the manuscript!
 Postal thievesΓÇª my customerΓÇÖs important parcelΓÇª!
 This is bad!
 This is 463-72. This is 463-72!
 A postal robbery has occurred!
 The thieves are a pair,
 a large man with a perverted look and a kid!
 ""They appear to be after 596-03ΓÇÖs parcel.""
 ""Members in the area are assigned to protect 596-03!""
 ""Stop the thieves in the name of the Delivery Ninja!""
 The only way to get to the Land of Fangs is to go up this river.
 More than likely they will also go by boat.
 Then depending on our speed, thereΓÇÖs a chance weΓÇÖll catch up.
 IΓÇÖm the one whoΓÇÖs got it rough.
 You donΓÇÖt have enough physical strength!
 Consider this also as training and apply yourself!
 That again?!
 WhoΓÇÖre those guys?!
 It appears reinforcements have been summoned.
 Hurry, Naruto!
 Naruto! Switch places!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 SomehowΓÇªthe Rasengan looks like a really cheap JutsuΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs for the sake of preventing a war!
 Our mission of peace is at stake!
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Switch.
 Huh?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 ThatΓÇÖs it!
 Hey, wait! ItΓÇÖs a slip-up! This is the real one!
 They got switched during the commission!
 Delivery Ninja old man, itΓÇÖs the truth!
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 According to our rule, we are never to look inside
 a customerΓÇÖs parcel we have taken on, no matter what.
 If that passes over to the Land of Fangs,
 there will be war!
 Even if that were the case, I must not break the rule.
 YouΓÇÖre impossible!
 ItΓÇÖs the Land of Fangs!
 All we do is carry out our duties!
 ThenΓÇªweΓÇÖll take it away by force if we have to.
 ΓÇô Postal delivery! ΓÇô Postal delivery!
 Naruto! Do you know which one it is?!
 No, I donΓÇÖt!
 I am 596-03.
 I know! ItΓÇÖs 596-03!
 Where is he?!
 Up there!
 Naruto, you hold back the front! IΓÇÖll rout the rest!
 Got it!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you go past here!
 In the name of the Delivery Ninja,
 I will not let anyone interfere!
 YouΓÇÖre an impressive old manΓÇª
 I too, in the name of the Leaf Ninja,
 will take away the manuscript with a Jutsu!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Harem Jutsu! Riverside Mad Dance!
 Mis-ter De-li-very Nin-ja.
 No, no! This isnΓÇÖt the time to be doing something like this.
 Now, to get cracking with my delivery.

 I will deliver.
 Hey, where are you going? Play with me.
 No, no! Not that way.
 IΓÇÖll do my best!
 Guys! Give me a hand!
 ΓÇô Right! Yeah. 					ΓÇô Okay!
 P-P-Postal delivery.
 Okay, good work.
 This guyΓÇÖs iron will is the real dealΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre too late, huhΓÇª?
 Is war going to start?!
 Th-This is--!
 ItΓÇÖs a manuscript of the latest issue of the Make-Out series!

 To think heΓÇÖd know I was a big fan of the Make-Out series!
 Everyone!
 Stop the fighting!
 Send a messenger to the Land of Claws!
 DonΓÇÖt let anybody inΓÇª
 I kind of donΓÇÖt really get it, butΓÇª with this, thereΓÇÖll be no war?
 No war is fineΓÇª
 But does this mean my writing power is the same as NarutoΓÇÖs scribblingΓÇª?!
 Now then!
 TodayΓÇÖs the day the Akatsuki Organization guy comes!
 WeΓÇÖll capture him no matter what and get information about SasukeΓÇª
 Pervy Sage?
 Sorry, Naruto. There was a development while you were sleeping.
 I will pursue the Akatsuki Organization as is.
 IΓÇÖve been had!
 WellΓÇª I suppose it made for some good trainingΓÇª

 He is currently on the run.
 On the run?
 Are you telling me even with the array of the Anbu Black Ops,
 we still canΓÇÖt catch him?
 Who is he?
 You must know his identity by now.
 There was nobody in the recent Bingo Book
 that fit his description,
 but when we checked an older Bingo BookΓÇª
 Genno?
 Genno the Trapper?
 You do know of him?
 He should be quite old by now.
 I hadnΓÇÖt heard his name in a while,
 so I thought that he had already retired, butΓÇª
 I never would have thought that he was infiltrating the Leaf Village.
 I guess I canΓÇÖt fight against old age.
 NoΓÇª I guess I should say this is just what I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops.

 Paper Bombs!
 Retreat!
 Are you saying that someone
 is planning a huge attack against the Leaf Village?!
 That would be the only reason anyone would want those plans
 besides carpentry purposes.
 GennoΓÇÖs last words suggest that as well.
 ItΓÇÖs going to take some time to decipher those plans,
 but itΓÇÖs too dangerous to depend on that.
 The enemy may attack us any minute.

 Fog? Last nightΓÇÖs weather didnΓÇÖt seem like it was going to be foggy.
 How strangeΓÇª Was it all a dream?
 DoesnΓÇÖt it seem like weΓÇÖre really low on people?
 ThatΓÇÖs what I was thinking, too.
 From the looks of it,
 the village must be under special security alert.
 What?! For real?! I didnΓÇÖt notice it!
 You should notice these kinds of things. YouΓÇÖre a Ninja.
 But if weΓÇÖre in a state of emergency,
 itΓÇÖs a huge deal for the village, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Why havenΓÇÖt they told us anything?
 ThatΓÇÖs why Lady Tsunade is calling us.
 Come in.
 Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto.
 ShikamaruΓÇª
 So you mustΓÇÖve been left out, too.
 Huh? What are you taking about?
 NothingΓÇª
 Oh, hey Shikamaru. About last nightΓÇÖs weird fogΓÇª
 Did you see it?
 Stop it. You were just dreaming.
 There was no fog.
 See. I told youΓÇª
 That was a smoke screen.
 Smoke screen?
 IΓÇÖll explain once everyone gets here.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Naruto, SakuraΓÇª
 The reason why we left you out of
 the S-Level Emergency Security Alert unit
 is because we wanted you to work under Shikamaru
 for a special mission.
 What?
 Well, thatΓÇÖs the case.
 First, I want you to gather the people IΓÇÖm about to name.
 Hey, calm down, Naruto!
 But itΓÇÖs already past the time we were supposed to gather!
 Not quite. To be accurate, we still have twenty more seconds.
 Seems like heΓÇÖs here.
 Oh? EveryoneΓÇÖs already here?
 No matter how you look at it, youΓÇÖre the last one!
 EveryoneΓÇÖs here now. Then letΓÇÖs begin.
 IΓÇÖm sure that you all have already noticed.
 The village is currently under the S-Level Emergency Security Alert.
 It all started whenΓÇª
 The smoke screen last night, right?
 You guys noticed it?
 Of course.
 The bugs were being noisyΓÇª
 Huh? I didnΓÇÖt notice it.
 YouΓÇÖre always so out of it!
 SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI! 		I didnΓÇÖt notice it eitherΓÇª
 WORSE THAN NARUTO!! 		Could it be then that 		IΓÇÖm worse than Naruto?
 Worse than NarutoΓÇª Worse than NarutoΓÇª Worse than NarutoΓÇª
 So what was that?
 It seemed like something involving the Anbu Black Ops.
 So I stayed putΓÇª
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖs correct. The Anbu Black Ops were involved.
 Just as I thoughtΓÇª
 It was late last night.
 A man that the Anbu Black Ops had been marking for the past two weeks
 had snuck into the home of Leaf VillageΓÇÖs top carpenter bossΓÇª
 And he stole the plans of our villageΓÇÖs important facilities from the secret safe.
 PlansΓÇª?
 So whatΓÇÖs so bad about that?
 He just stole the plans for the facilities, right?
 Just stole? YouΓÇÖre soΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 For example, letΓÇÖs say the plans for the fort that surrounds the village
 fell into enemy handsΓÇª
 By analyzing those plans in detail,
 the enemy could figure out the most efficient way
 to break into the village.
 Now letΓÇÖs say that there were plans for Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs mansion.
 If you were to examine those plans,
 you could find out how to get the Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs room.
 And if the plans were to get into the hands of an assassinΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs really, really bad.
 Last nightΓÇÖs smoke screen wasΓÇª
 something that suspect spread as he was running away.
 I seeΓÇª
 In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered him in the Western ForestΓÇª
 He killed himself before they could get him to talk.
 Unfortunately, when he committed suicide,
 he wasn't in possession of the plans he had stolen.
 If the plans have already fallen into the hands of the enemyΓÇª
 it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare of the Destruction of Leaf Village.
 In order to prevent that from happening
 The S-Level Emergency Security Alert was deployed this morning.
 So, what is the mission for those of us who were left behind?
 Find out the location of the stolen plans and bring them back.
 That's our mission.
 ItΓÇÖs like finding a needle in a haystack.
 We just need to investigate the path he took
 and people he was acquainted with.
 It turns out that the guy was famous for being a top-level trap technician.
 ItΓÇÖs a huge possibility that he left traps where the plans are.
 ItΓÇÖs definitely plausible.
 I understand. WeΓÇÖll follow your instructions.
 IΓÇÖll do it.
 Then letΓÇÖs start the investigation.
 Turns out that the man had snuck into the village
 a few months ago and worked as a carpenter.
 Th-This guyΓÇª
 His name isΓÇªGenno
 YouΓÇÖre kidding me.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way! Old Man Genno loved the ramen at Ichiraku!
 He would never do anything that would destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!
 ListenΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs no way that a guy whoΓÇÖs sneaking in to an enemy village
 would show his bad side.
 He played the part of a good guy to let peopleΓÇÖs guard down.
 There is no way that anyone who loves ramen could be a bad person!
 No. ThatΓÇÖs not true Naruto.
 ChojiΓÇª You tell him. Put some sense into this guy.
 Anyone who loves IchirakuΓÇÖs ramen can't be a bad person!
 Choji!
 Gosh, I canΓÇÖt depend on anybodyΓÇª
 This is a list of the stolen plans.
 I'm so embarrassed we lost our important plansΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt show my face to Lady Tsunade.
 Which construction jobs were Genno involved with?
 None of them.
 But wasnΓÇÖt he working under you?
 I donΓÇÖt allow outsiders to work on any construction
 that involves the safety of the village.
 That old man only worked on residential construction.
 Which meansΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs little possibility that he snuck some traps into the construction.
 I think itΓÇÖs impossible.
 We should check everything, just in caseΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 Lady Hinata, please take care of these.
 Y-Yes!
 IΓÇÖll go too.
 Me too.
 IΓÇÖve mentioned it earlier, but there is a possibility
 the the plans haven't fallen into the enemy's hands yet.
 ItΓÇÖs possible that he could have hidden it while he was running away.
 And itΓÇÖs our mission to find that.
 Understood.
 ItΓÇÖs the start of a treasure hunt. IΓÇÖm depending on you Akamaru.
 Go!
 Ino and Sakura, you guys go check the old man's body.
 There might be some clues.
 What?! Us?
 I got it.
 All right! You just want me to go right?! IΓÇÖll go!
 Sakura, are you really okay with this?
 I have to be. IΓÇÖm training to become a Medical Ninja.
 I canΓÇÖt be afraid of something like this.
 That might be the case for you, butΓÇª
 NowΓÇªmaster carpenter.
 Can you tell us everything you know about Old Man Genno?
 The old man came to Leaf Village about three months agoΓÇª
 He came to my place with a recommendation letter
 from a famous master carpenter from the Land of Sand.
 As you may already know,
 thereΓÇÖs a bit of a construction boom in Leaf Village.
 Every place is in need of more people.
 And we needed more hands ourselves,
 so we decided to hire him right away.
 His carpeting skillsΓÇª were all right, just average.
 I didnΓÇÖt feel the urge to hire him permanently,
 nor did I feel like I wanted to fire him right away.
 He took his job seriously.
 He was perfect to hire when we were short on people.
 But after a while,
 I found out that the recommendation letter he brought was a fake.
 This is the recommendation letter he brought.
 And how is this a fake?
 There was a guy who brought a recommendation letter
 from the same master carpenter more than ten years ago.
 I just happen to find that recommendation letter,
 so I compared it and I noticed that the handwriting was differentΓÇª
 And that recommendation letter?
 ItΓÇÖs over there in that cabinetΓÇª
 Oh? Where did I put it? I know I put it hereΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okay if you donΓÇÖt have it.
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 For us, we really didnΓÇÖt care if his recommendation letter was a fake
 as long as he didnΓÇÖt do anything bad.
 I just thought that I should let things like this be known to Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt think that the old man was
 a Shinobi from another country and that he would steal our plansΓÇª
 I still canΓÇÖt believe it.
 Hey, is it really that old manΓÇÖs doing?
 I canΓÇÖt believe it either.
 There're no signs of trapsΓÇª
 All right.
 This is where the old man lived, huh?
 He always paid the rent on time.
 He really was quite properΓÇª
 Once in a while heΓÇÖd come home after drinking with his carpenter friends,
 but he would never cause trouble.
 Well, I did predict it, but there are no cluesΓÇª
 I found it!
 What did you find?
 A special bonito broth, refreshing udon and light broth super thin udon!
 WeΓÇÖre not looking for food!
 But usually if somebody is living by himself,
 heΓÇÖd probably stack up on a bit more foodΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs only instant cup-udon.
 DidnΓÇÖt he eat out a lot? I hear that he went to Ichiraku a lotΓÇª
 Right, Naruto?
 OhΓÇª Yeah.
 If he cooked himself, he could have eaten more and saved moneyΓÇª
 Choji, weΓÇÖre not talking about you.
 That old man barely talked about himselfΓÇª
 Just as I expected.
 Oh, but he did happily talk about
 how he became friends with one of the kids in the village.
 He might have heard something from the old man.
 Oh, I wonder about that.
 What you mean you wonder about that?
 We wonΓÇÖt know until we find the kid and question him, wonΓÇÖt we?
 But it seems like thereΓÇÖs no need for us to look for him or question him.
 What?! Then, where is this guy!
 Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto!
 What?! Me?!
 Yeah, thereΓÇÖs no mistake about that.
 YouΓÇÖre Naruto Uzumaki?
 Huh?
 We want you to talk with us for a bit.

 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs from that coke I just drank?
 I wonder what kind of interrogation Naruto is undergoing?
 I guess they would use Regressive Hypnosis or something.
 WhatΓÇÖs Regressive Hypnosis?
 ItΓÇÖs a Jutsu to draw out subconscious memories.
 Then Naruto might know something even with his bad memory.
 Hmm. I wonder about that.
 Well, this Old Man Genno sounds like he was pretty trickyΓÇª
 Wait, why are you here anyway?

 WellΓÇªitΓÇÖs all right.
 See you tomorrow!
 OkayΓÇª Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!
 It looks like he got over it.
 Hey, Lee!
 On your way back from rehabilitation?
 UmΓÇªyesΓÇª
 I hope you get better soon.
 Thank you very much.
 To activate each and every cell all at onceΓÇª
 If it were just one by one, itΓÇÖd be a snap,
 but all of them together is gonna be tough.
 StillΓÇª
 The Leaf Village is in great trouble right now,
 so we must do our best!
 I think if you had Lady Tsunade take a look, you'd get better very quickly.
 It's better that you give up being a Shinobi and look for a different path.
 Sensei and Student: The Bond of the Shinobi
 Clone Jutsu!
 Transformation Jutsu!
 Hey, young kidΓÇª
 The medal of youth is one of passion, with no looking back!
 If you work hard at it,
 IΓÇÖm telling you, son, you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!
 Who is he? He is pretty overbearing.
 Son, be ambitious! Bloom of YouthΓÇª
 Well then, adieu.
 That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.
 And thenΓÇª
 Today, you have all become Genin.
 I want to hear what your goals are for the future.
 I donΓÇÖt want to answer.
 I-IΓÇª!
 I'd like to prove that I could become a splendid Ninja,
 even though I canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Those are good serious eyesΓÇª
 You! What's so funny?!
 I'm serious!
 I will become a respectable Ninja even only with Taijutsu!
 DonΓÇÖt you realize that if you canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,
 youΓÇÖre not a Ninja in the first place?
 DonΓÇÖt you remember being told that youΓÇÖre the first person
 to graduate from the academy whoΓÇÖs only able to use Taijutsu ?
 ItΓÇÖs not because youΓÇÖre so good; itΓÇÖs just that youΓÇÖre unusual.
 W-Why--!
 Listen up! If you have passion, itΓÇÖs not necessarily so.
 If you act with passion,
 compete with good rivals and lift each other up,
 you can all become great Ninja!
 But you know, you have to work hard!
 PassionΓÇª
 IΓÇªwas inspired by Guy Sensei.
 By his wordsΓÇªand his deeds.
 YouΓÇÖre late! 17 minutes and 32 seconds late!
 LetΓÇÖs not do it today, all right?
 Each of us has 48 wins!
 With a win today, one of us will pull ahead!
 I guess you won't give up even if I say I wouldnΓÇÖt want to do it.
 ItΓÇÖs my turn to choose the event, right?
 Right! WhatΓÇÖs it gonna be?
 A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash?
 Holding our breath under water?
 I donΓÇÖt care, we could even have an eating contestΓÇª
 PleaseΓÇª
 Okay, thenΓÇª
 Wh-What?!
 Rock, paper, scissors!
 Rock, paper, scissors? ThatΓÇÖs what you choose?
 They say that your luck is one part of your skill, donΓÇÖt they?
 Plus, itΓÇÖs a great competition for testing your observational reflexesΓÇª
 R-Right.
 Do you get the feeling KakashiΓÇÖs just playing around with Guy
 ΓÇÿcuz he can't be bothered?
 ThatΓÇÖs what it looks like to me.
 I accept the battle. ThereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖm gonna lose!
 If I do, IΓÇÖll walk around the Leaf Village 500 times on my hands!
 There you go againΓÇª
 I promise!
 Here we goΓÇª
 Another one of your special, self-imposed rules.
 He canΓÇÖt do that.
 ThatΓÇÖs ridiculous. HeΓÇÖs acting like a kid.
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖs impossible, even for Guy Sensei.
 Impossible? Reckless, IΓÇÖd say!
 ΓÇô Rock, paperΓÇª! ΓÇô Rock, paperΓÇª!
 Here you are.
 Guy Sensei?
 How did you know I was here?
 I know everything about you.
 I heard that you skipped out on rehabilitation these past two days?
 You canΓÇÖt be doing that!
 When I first became GeninΓÇª
 this is where I revealed my dream, my aspiration.
 Neji laughed at me then, but I meant what I said.
 I'd like to prove that I could become a splendid Ninja
 even though I can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 At that time, you told meΓÇª
 If you act with passion, compete with rivals,
 you can become a fine Ninja.
 And thatΓÇª
 In order to do that, itΓÇÖd take ΓÇ£effort.ΓÇ¥
 I was happy to hear that.
 ΓÇô Transform! 					ΓÇô Transform!
 Because while at the academyΓÇª
 no one, not one friend or teacher, said that kind of thing to me.
 You put me at easeΓÇª
 You opened up a path just when I was unsure of myself.
 I realized all I had to do was try my best.
 And when I complained that
 all my efforts couldnΓÇÖt match the othersΓÇÖ natural talents,
 you told me that I had a natural talent for effort.
 That was when I learned the importance of believing in my own strength.
 The chance of a successful surgery is probably 50%, at best.
 ButΓÇªthis is one timeΓÇª even if I try my bestΓÇª!
 and even if I believe in myself, thereΓÇÖs nothing in the world I can do!
 Guy SenseiΓÇª Please tell meΓÇª!
 Please tell me. Can I become like you?
 Why did this kind of thing happen only to me?
 Because I have my own Way of Ninja to follow,
 my own dreams and aspirations that I have to protect and
 prove to the world even if it means dying forΓÇª
 What should I do?!
 The Eight Inner GatesΓÇª
 Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that will destroy the body of the practitioner?
 Please tell me!
 IΓÇÖm prepared for the worst.
 Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!
 Everything isΓÇªfor my dream!
 That means everything to me!
 You tried to become a great Ninja relying only on TaijutsuΓÇª
 Until now, thatΓÇÖs all you had.
 It must be so painful for youΓÇª
 Now that it seems that your dreams
 and all your wishes are being cruelly taken away.
 It does not matter what his wishes are, he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.
 LeeΓÇª
 If you want to be free of that pain, you have to prepare yourself!
 Does it meanΓÇª to prepare to give up my dreams?
 If you lose your dreams,
 you will undergo pain even greater than what you feel now.
 Neither you nor I would be able to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
 What fools we areΓÇª
 Lee! Have the surgery!
 HowΓÇÖs it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?
 ItΓÇÖs all about the Chakra, butΓÇª
 There are so many kinds of cellsΓÇª
 skin cells, internal organ cells, muscular cellsΓÇª
 You know, itΓÇÖs just a tad difficult to activate all of them at once.
 WhatΓÇÖs that? ΓÇ£Just a tad,ΓÇ¥ you say?
 Are you testing me?
 Oh no!
 IΓÇÖm declaring my trust in you.
 I donΓÇÖt know why, but just a while agoΓÇª
 I was remembering the time when you and Kakashi Sensei
 were competing with rock, paper, scissors.
 At that time, Kakashi Sensei said
 that your luck is one part of your skill, right?
 This surgery is also fifty-fifty, live or dieΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs not a game of rock, paper, scissors!
 Do you remember what happened after that, Lee?
 500 times aroundΓÇª ltΓÇÖs a promise! Yay!
 What's he doing?!
 Shoot!
 If I lose, IΓÇÖll walk 500 times around the Leaf Village, on my hands!
 It's a promise!
 He canΓÇÖt do that! ThatΓÇÖs stupid. HeΓÇÖs acting like a kid.
 Hah! This is nothing!
 Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?
 Why are you doing this?
 Kakashi Sensei is not here. ln fact, no one is watching.
 When a man stands cool with a Nice-guy pose in front of others,
 he should keep his promise, even if it kills him!
 ItΓÇÖs a promise!
 What?
 Why do you always do that?
 Whenever youΓÇÖre about to start doing something,
 why do you always come up with some kind of crazy rule.
 Good question, Lee.
 You really know how to get to the point.
 OK, IΓÇÖll tell you. But remember, you canΓÇÖt tell anyone else.
 WhatΓÇÖs the answer?
 Making self-rules is nothing less than a practice which brings me victory!
 S-Self-rulesΓÇª?
 Are you ready?
 The point of these rules is that, when youΓÇÖre going after something,
 they push you into a real tough spotΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs about chaining yourself down.
 For example, on the other side of the hellish rule that
 ΓÇ£If I lose at rock, scissors, paper, IΓÇÖll do 500 lapsΓÇ¥ is the idea that
 ΓÇ£If I do 500 laps,
 thereΓÇÖs no way I wonΓÇÖt be able to beat Kakashi next time.ΓÇ¥
 They hold power, the potential of the heavens.
 Y-YesΓÇª
 By being chained down to doing 500 laps,
 it makes you get serious.
 Even about things like rock, paper, scissors competitions,
 which are so trifling otherwise.
 And, even if you lose, walking around the village 500 times
 give you the benefit of extremely intense training.
 I see!
 OK, IΓÇÖve gotta do a little more. Here we go!
 IΓÇÖm going with you! I have my own ΓÇ£self-ruleΓÇ¥ which is--
 Hey! Hey! DonΓÇÖt push yourself, Lee.
 If I canΓÇÖt keep up with you, I'llΓÇª
 try even harder!
 That is, IΓÇÖll aim to be like you.
 And if I keep trying, IΓÇÖll be able to become a great Ninja!
 All right! If thatΓÇÖs the case, then I have an addition to my rule!
 If you canΓÇÖt keep up with me all the way to the endΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll put every ounce of my being into training you!
 If I train you with all my being, youΓÇÖll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!
 I promise!
 Huh, thatΓÇÖs right.
 That was the first time you told me about the ""self-rule,"" wasnΓÇÖt it?
 Your surgery will be a success
 because you have worked hard all the way through.
 You have the power to bring your own future in the heavens.
 And in the one in a thousandΓÇª
 no, one in a million chance that something goes wrongΓÇª
 I will die with you!
 Ever since I met you,
 my Way of Ninja has been to nurture you into a fine Ninja.
 I promise you!
 Neither you nor I would be able to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
 What fools we areΓÇª
 G-Guy Sensei!
 OK, letΓÇÖs go, Lee!
 Yes, sir!
 Lady Tsunade!
 From this day forward,
 I am the ruler of the Village Hidden in the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Darn! He has no hole in his defense.
 Being impatient won't do any good, Naruto.
 Let's utilize the next mission.
 That's right. The next mission requires an overnight stay.
 ΓÇô Our chance will be at the inn. ΓÇô Roger that!
 Once we get to the inn, we'll wait until he's defenselessΓÇª

 Bunta! Under the earth!
 What?!
 ItΓÇÖs the tail?!
 Keep it shut!
 They're Sannin, all right.
 Dealing with two of them is rough.
 Tsunade!
 Well now, I can kill you by wringing your neck.
 My ChakraΓÇª
 At this rateΓÇª
 Even though you say you wonΓÇÖt die in battle,
 you won't have a choice if I rip your neck offΓÇª
 Right, Tsunade?
 How many minutesΓÇª
 How many seconds can I hold onΓÇª?
 I have to put it on the line!
 Fine!
 ItΓÇÖs about time we put an end to this!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Not done yet!
 Take this!
 Darn itΓÇª!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª Not thatΓÇª!
 SheΓÇÖs reached her limitΓÇª
 NoΓÇª
 This guyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve hurled him around that much, yet heΓÇÖs stillΓÇª
 So this is as far as you can go.
 Shut up!
 DonΓÇÖt rest!
 Keep beating him.
 This is the battleΓÇª
 where I put my life on the line!
 Lord Orochimaru!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you go!
 You will stay with me until the end!
 Take this!
 I hit him and hit him. SomethingΓÇÖs differentΓÇª
 What is it? ThisΓÇªstrange sense of discomfort?
 However, with thisΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs over!
 He took a direct hit!
 That was it.
 YeahΓÇª
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 Putting me in this position!
 I want to eat you and kill you,
 but I canΓÇÖt even chew you up with this hole in my mouthΓÇª
 Next time, if we meet again, be prepared!
 TsunadeΓÇª
 Even though you wonΓÇÖt heal me, I still have one way.
 A way to resurrect these arms.
 The Leaf VillageΓÇª IΓÇÖll destroy itΓÇªwithout fail.
 At that time, it would be nice if we could meet againΓÇª
 My comradesΓÇª Tsunade and Jiraiya.
 That faceΓÇª?!
 In some way or another, he took someone elseΓÇÖs bodyΓÇª?!
 No wonder, when we went at it a while ago,
 I didnΓÇÖt get the same feeling from him that I did in the pastΓÇª
 The true elixir of life.
 ThatΓÇÖs myΓÇª
 my immortality!
 Some day, in the futureΓÇª
 Wait!
 The bones in my ribs and feet are brokenΓÇª
 The side effects of the Jutsu are startingΓÇª
 My body isΓÇªalreadyΓÇª
 Tsunade, you havenΓÇÖt changed. YouΓÇÖre no good at wagers.
 The Hokage is my dream!
 IΓÇÖll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 IΓÇÖll acknowledge that you have what it takes to become the HokageΓÇª
 and give you this necklace.
 It's no joke!
 If I have three days, IΓÇÖll master this Jutsu!
 Men donΓÇÖt go back on their word!
 IΓÇÖm the grandson of the Hokage who built the Village Hidden in Leaves, soΓÇª!
 You said it. Men donΓÇÖt go back on their word!
 Right! IΓÇÖll become just like Grandfather. And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 I love this village and my comrades.
 So I want to protect them.
 An existence that protects everyone.
 Becoming the Hokage is my dreamΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like youΓÇª to take this.
 Any time now, the side effectsΓÇª
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 YouΓÇª
 It's nothingΓÇª If I rest a bit, IΓÇÖll return to my young form.
 IΓÇÖll rest in town.
 And when Naruto wakes up, WeΓÇÖll return to Konoha.
 TsunadeΓÇª
 Starting now, donΓÇÖt call me Tsunade. Call meΓÇª
 The Fifth Hokage?!
 Old Lady Tsunade is the Fifth Hokage starting todayΓÇª
 What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.
 After all, compared to the old man, the Third Hokage,
 thereΓÇÖs somethingΓÇª
 rough-natured and kind of selfishΓÇª
 loose with money, catty and stupidΓÇª
 Somehow, IΓÇÖm going to worry if she can do it properly.
 Lady Tsunade, would you like to order somethingΓÇª
 Moreover, a 50-year-old lady transforming into a young ladyΓÇª
 Is it okay for the person who will become Hokage
 to lie to everyone, I wonderΓÇª?
 Go outside, brat!
 ItΓÇÖs just like beforeΓÇª
 Despite how I look, IΓÇÖm going to be the Fifth Hokage.
 I shouldnΓÇÖt take this short brat of a foe seriouslyΓÇª
 This one is enoughΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt call me brat!
 I may be like this now, but IΓÇÖll be Hokage some day!
 Here I go!
 Another brow flick?!
 Become a fine manΓÇª
 and, a fine Hokage.
 Yeah!
 Okay! Shall we go home?
 To our hometown the Leaf Village!
 What? I havenΓÇÖt eaten yetΓÇª!
 DonΓÇÖt try to distract me by laughing!
 NawakiΓÇª DanΓÇª
 the boy who will inherit your dreams, my beloved ones,
 is right here!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Yahoo! Here we are at a hot spring spot!
 While Pervy Sage is gawking at women, and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,
 I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!
 What?! Who worked over my room?!
 I don't know who they are,
 but I'm gonna find them and kick their butts!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 Akamaru Trembles: GaaraΓÇÖs Cruel Strength!
 That guy...?
 Everyone hide!
 No, lie low quick!
 W-Where is that guy?
 Naruto...
 That fool, he finally woke up.
 You are quite one of a kind.
 Actually, you are getting on my nerves.
 Sakura!
 ΓÇô What? 					ΓÇô Y-Y-Your...!
 Sakura... your hair!
 Oh! This...?
 IΓÇÖm changing my image, changing my image!
 I like it better long but,
 when I move around in a forest like this,
 it gets in the way if itΓÇÖs long.
 By the way...
 why are you guys here?!
 Hah... ItΓÇÖs such a pain to explain it to you.
 Everybody helped out.
 Huh?
 SakuraΓÇÖs putting on a show of bravado...
 IΓÇÖll take care of him from here.
 Ah... Okay...
 Keep it together! Lee!
 Oh? Tenten, why are you here?
 I came to help.
 Huh...?
 Those guys, whereΓÇÖs the Sound Village Ninjas?
 A kid named Sasuke drove them away!
 ReallyΓÇª
 Why did you hastily decided to act on your own?!
 Besides, you really got beaten up!
 S-Sakura was in danger. So as a man, I...
 YouΓÇÖre kidding...!
 If it were Lee alone, he wouldnΓÇÖt have lost to those guys.
 YouΓÇÖre really stupid.
 I canΓÇÖt argue with that.
 You, Bushy-Brow!
 Naruto!
 DonΓÇÖt say rude things to Lee!
 What in the world...
 happened while I was asleep?
 That Naruto, heΓÇÖs completely out of the loop.
 HeΓÇÖs not the type to be the protagonist of a story, certainly not.
 Lee...
 Thank you.
 Because of you, I was able to wake up.
 I feel like IΓÇÖve gotten a little stronger!
 Sakura...
 It looks like my efforts werenΓÇÖt enough!
 Sasuke... Just what youΓÇÖd expect from the Uchiha clan.
 To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,
 just as I thought, you possess amazing strength.
 I was beaten to a pulp.
 What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!
 WhatΓÇÖs he talking about?
 Were those guys really that strong?
 Sakura!
 The Lotus of Leaf Village blooms twice.
 Huh?
 When we meet again, I will have become a stronger man.
 I pledge it.
 Okay.
 Hey Sakura!
 Come here, come here!
 Your hair! IΓÇÖll fix it for you!
 That'd be great.
 You are really sneaky.
 Hugging him like that, you little billboard brow.
 ItΓÇÖs called first come-first served, Miss Ino-pig.
 Sasuke... Uchiha.
 At any rateΓÇªheΓÇÖs a strong opponent.
 Are you okay, Akamaru?
 Is he still shaking?
 ItΓÇÖs already been half a day.
 Akamaru...
 I donΓÇÖt blame him,  itΓÇÖs because he saw that thing...
 After all, brains are most important in survival!
 Right. Akamaru?
 Lucky for us,
 the guys who got caught in the trap had an earth scroll!
 WeΓÇÖll be the first to the tower at this rate!
 DonΓÇÖt get carried away. ThatΓÇÖs dangerous.
 No matter how small a bug it is, it has to guard itself at all times.
 We have to pay attention to avoid coming across any enemies...
 This is safety.
 I know that!
 As always, youΓÇÖre speaking in a way thatΓÇÖs difficult to understand, bug-nerd.
 Um... B-But... What Shino said...
 He has a point.
 I know! CΓÇÖmon.
 Naruto...
 I hope nothingΓÇÖs happened to him...
 Hey you two, stop.
 WeΓÇÖre being careful not to come across enemy, right?
 Then Hinata!
 Can you see 1 kilometer in that direction?
 Yep... IΓÇÖll have a look. Byakugan!
 T-ThereΓÇÖs someone there.
 Evidently there are... 6 peopleΓÇª
 Okay! LetΓÇÖs go look!
 Huh?
 Kiba! What are you saying? WeΓÇÖre not doing that.
 The Proctor told us to bring
 one of each ΓÇ£HeavenΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£EarthΓÇ¥ scroll in a pair.
 He didnΓÇÖt say not to take more than that.
 If we take more, that means some other teams will be left out.
 B-But...
 WeΓÇÖll just see whatΓÇÖs going on at first..
 If it looks too dangerous, we wonΓÇÖt battle for no reason.
 ΓÇô LetΓÇÖs go! 					ΓÇô Oh!
 HeΓÇÖs an irritating type, that one.
 WhatΓÇÖs up, Akamaru?
 What happened? You stopped suddenly.
 Akamaru suddenly got frightened.
 W-Why is that?
 Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemyΓÇÖs Chakra and tell his strength.
 But this is the first time IΓÇÖve seen him this scared.
 The people going at it up ahead arenΓÇÖt ordinary guys...
 Sand Village kids coming to challenge us forthright.
 ItΓÇÖs foolish.
 WhatΓÇÖs that little guy thinking to get involved with those guys...?!
 W-What is Akamaru saying...?
 HeΓÇÖs saying that big guy is dangerous.
 T-They certainly look like bad news...
 They seem really strong.
 Hey, kids, you should pick your opponents...
 YouΓÇÖre all going to die.
 ThatΓÇÖs enough of you.
 LetΓÇÖs do this quickly... old chap from Hidden Rain Village.
 Which scroll do those guys have...
 Hey Gaara!
 DoesnΓÇÖt it make sense to follow them
 and gather information before hunting them?
 If they have the same type of scroll thereΓÇÖs no need to fight.
 Unnecessary battles areΓÇª.
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter.
 If their eyes meet with mine... IΓÇÖll kill them all.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I donΓÇÖt want  to be with this guy.
 Well, letΓÇÖs do it. Quickly!
 Die, kid!
 Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
 Hidden Senbons!
 Up down right left, there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.
 In addition, all the Senbons are controlled by my Chakra
 and attack on the intended prey!
 Too easy.
 Is that all?
 I-It canΓÇÖt be...?!
 Not even one...?
 No wounds...? Ridiculous!
 Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?
 Well, IΓÇÖll make it rain blood.
 What a giant Chakra.
 And, that sand...
 It smells terrible.
 Smell?
 A strong smell of blood...
 Wall of sand...?
 ThatΓÇÖs right. An absolute defense by sand!
 He manipulates sand inside a gourd and
 hardens it with magnified Chakra.
 It defends the circumference of GaaraΓÇÖs body.
 ItΓÇÖs a Jutsu that only he can get away with...
 Furthermore, itΓÇÖs somehow always automatically done
 without GaaraΓÇÖs intentions.
 Which means that all attacks in front of Gaara fade into nothing.
 That little...
 You guys canΓÇÖt defeat our Gaara.
 DonΓÇÖt underestimate me!
 This guy's a gonerΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what you get for rebelling against Gaara...
 Sand Coffin!
 I canΓÇÖt move...
 T-This wonΓÇÖt...!
 I can cover your loud mouth and kill you.
 But thatΓÇÖs too pathetic.
 Sand Burial!
 ThereΓÇÖs no pain.
 I knocked him even harder than was necessary.
 The bloody tears of a corpse merge with vast sinking sand
 and provide more power to the demon of war.
 T-The scroll.
 WeΓÇÖll give it to you!
 Please! Let us go!
 No-o-o-!
 T-This is bad.
 LetΓÇÖs escape quickly! lf he finds us heΓÇÖll kill us!
 Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.
 Okay! LetΓÇÖs go to the tower.
 Shut up.
 ItΓÇÖs stillΓÇªnot enough for me!
 U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!
 LetΓÇÖs quit... Gaara.
 Are you scared, coward?
 Gaara! ItΓÇÖs certainly no problem for you, but itΓÇÖs too dangerous for us!
 One set of scrolls is good.
 More than this is...
 Lame people donΓÇÖt give directions to me.
 ThatΓÇÖs enough!
 How about if you sometimes listen to what your big brother has to say?!
 IΓÇÖve never thought of you as my siblings.
 If you get in my way... IΓÇÖll kill you.
 G-Gaara cut it out! Please.
 DonΓÇÖt say something so cold.
 As a favor to your sister... Okay?!
 Gaara!
 Fine.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I hate brats.
 What? So thatΓÇÖs it Akamaru?
 CΓÇÖmon, you should have said something sooner.
 NobodyΓÇÖs here...?
 Heh heh! WeΓÇÖre the first?!
 No, I sensed someone a little while ago.
 More importantly, is Akamaru okay?
 HeΓÇÖs been scared ever since then.
 Now that you mention it, what did Akamaru say before?
 Oh... Akamaru said that it was dangerous
 because that sand squirt would kill that big guy.
 Sheesh! Just like I thought, thereΓÇÖs no other place to go!
 TheyΓÇÖve already made us wait for half a day!
 How much longer do we have to wait?
 Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...
 I donΓÇÖt know what he is but, that guyΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs too dangerous.
 ItΓÇÖs becoming a real disaster, but we canΓÇÖt cancel this test.
 What do you mean?
 Excuse me!
 What is it?! WeΓÇÖre talking about something important!
 Excuse me.
 But... Uh...
 Please take a look at this!
 The video...?
 Ready? Here! Look at the time!
 T-This isΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a recording inside the tower,
 one hour and thirty-seven minutes after the start of the second test!
 Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Village broke through the second test.
 This canΓÇÖt be...!
 In a mere ninety-seven minutes...
 This has never happened!
 This is an anomaly.
 Those guys are not Genin level.
 TheyΓÇÖve rewritten the fastest time by four hoursΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not just that.
 What do you mean?
 ItΓÇÖs 10 kilometers from the test entrances to the tower.
 Ferocious animals, poisonous insects, the rugged forest road...
 As if those were not thereΓÇª
 Especially the brown-haired kid right in frontΓÇª
 What about him?
 You donΓÇÖt notice?
 I see. This is quite a surprise.
 What about him is so...?
 Look closely at his body.
 I see.
 He doesnΓÇÖt have a single scratch.
 WhatΓÇÖs worse, there's not a smudge of dirt on his clothing.
 Even I...
 No, any of the other Chunin...
 ItΓÇÖs impossible for us to make it to this tower without a scratch.
 ItΓÇÖs likely that it has something to do with his ability.
 After a long time, a dependable guy has appeared.
 Even though heΓÇÖs got evil eyes.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 ΓÇô Please! 					ΓÇô No!
 ΓÇô Just a little bit. 					ΓÇô No!
 ΓÇô Really only a little bit. ΓÇô No means no!
 IΓÇÖll just look a little and put it back.
 Remember what the Proctors said, loser.
 When they say donΓÇÖt look, donΓÇÖt look,
 it just makes me want to look all the more!
 If you can look when you can, letΓÇÖs look!
 Naruto lost it!
 Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Say, Grandma Tsunada, am I really soΓÇª?
 Come to think of it, recently I feel dull
 and I make more mistakes  with Jutsu than before.
 And, whatΓÇÖs more, even worseΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt eat more than five of the large-size ramen noodles at IchirakuΓÇª
 Might I perhaps have some terrible illness?!
 Come on, and tell me. IΓÇÖm prepared to hear the worst!
 You are in good health.
 Huh?
 Hey! ThatΓÇÖs Bushy BrowΓÇÖs medical record, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Recently heΓÇÖs been avoiding his regular check-ups.
 Bring him in, will you?
 Huh? But, what about meΓÇª?
 You are stupid. ThatΓÇÖs all!
 Be on your way!
 ΓÇô Put your clothes back on, you idiot! ΓÇô Yes!
 Unbelievable!
 How was it?
 IΓÇÖm fit as a fiddle!
 I could tell that just by looking at you.
 WhatΓÇÖs that all about?
 He doesnΓÇÖt seem to be in a very good mood, does he?
 Oh, by the way, have you seen Bushy Brow?
 No, but I know where he is.
 These days, you can always find him here.

 It slipped my mind. IΓÇÖve been feeling fine lately, so I justΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt look like it though.
 HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL
 Rest for a while.
 You are forbidden from engaging in any missions or training for the duration.
 There is cumulative damage to your Chakra Network.
 You were once injured so badly
 that you had to give up on being a Ninja for a while.
 ItΓÇÖs my self-rule.
 Your self-rule?
 Yes! To never forget my original intentions!
 As long as I keep on trying, I will be able to continue on as a Ninja!
 All right.
 I will remove you from active duty for a while,
 but you may continue training. Just don't overdo it.
 Yes!
 In particular, I prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus!
 Got that?
 Y-YesΓÇª
 Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go?
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong? Hey!
 The results were bad.
 Judging from the way he looked, IΓÇÖd say considerablyΓÇª
 By ΓÇ£considerably,ΓÇ¥ do you mean that ΓÇ£considerablyΓÇ¥?
 Yes. Considerable, to be sure.
 Considerable?!
 What are you so down about?! Lee!
 Guy Sensei!
 I heard the results of the exam. You have permission to train, donΓÇÖt you?
 Yes, but the Hidden LotusΓÇª
 That day, you were crying right thereΓÇª
 Your surgery will be a success
 because you have worked hard all the way through.
 You have the power to bring your own future in the heavens.
 And in the one in a thousandΓÇö
 no, one in a million chance that something goes wrongΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going to die with you!
 Ever since the time I met you,
 my Way of Ninja has been bringing you up to be a fine Ninja.
 I promise you!
 You believed me then and had the surgery. And it was successful.
 You must have faith in me one more time!
 If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus,
 then strive to attain an even greater technique through your efforts!
 There are no limits in the face of your efforts.
 Sensei!
 You are a genius at effort!
 Yes, sir!
 I'll give you some training for the first time in quite a spell!
 First, dash to the Academy practice hall!
 Please instruct me!
 If you donΓÇÖt get there in ten seconds,  itΓÇÖs 500 push-ups!
 Right!
 The Third Super-Beast!
 It was rash of us to think we could make it in ten seconds, after all.
 Just as well!
 Five hundredΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs been a long time since  I smelled this smellΓÇª
 Who is he?
 ThatΓÇÖs Yagura. HeΓÇÖs been here for a week.
 An acquaintance asked me to determine whether he has aptitude as a Ninja.
 His name is Yagura, you say?
 HeΓÇÖs pretty good, isnΓÇÖt he?
 Yes, he has the instincts for it.
 He absorbs the things I teach him like sand absorbs water.
 Oh! YouΓÇÖre Rock Lee, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Y-YesΓÇª
 I hear that you have superb techniques.
 Sensei has told me about you.
 No, nothing that greatΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt be bashful, you.
 ΓÇô Master Guy? 					ΓÇô Yes?
 I would like to receive some instruction  from my senior.
 Fine, then. Begin!
 Huh?!
 Guy Sensei!
 You came to train, anyway.
 First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner  and warm up.
 I seeΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs a spring chick who has just arrived, so try not to let him get hurt.
 Right.
 WhatΓÇÖs Bushy Brow doing in  the Academy practice hall of all places?
 I thought his condition was considerably bad!
 Yes, considerably! Considerably!
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 IΓÇÖm inexperienced, but please instruct me.
 Oh, please bear with me, too.
 Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you both to give it all you've got
 but to also observe the greatest courtesy.
 That is friendship! That is youth. Get ready. Fight!
 H-HeΓÇÖs fast!
 LetΓÇÖs have you show meΓÇª
 The depth of the Taijutsu that Might Guy drilled into you!
 What power!
 Every single blow is heavy!
 I havenΓÇÖt the strength to absorb them!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Closing off the escape path above  and strike from a low positionΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 The Leaf Hurricane was defeated!
 Stop! Hold it right there!
 Lee! Are you all right?
 Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow!
 What was that that just happened?
 The Cross MethodΓÇª
 Meeting the opponentΓÇÖs kick
 and pinning his foot between the knee and elbow simultaneouslyΓÇö
 a ΓÇ£bone-crushing daring technique .ΓÇ¥
 Where on earth did you learn that, Yagura!
 I didnΓÇÖt intend to do that.
 My body just moved like that involuntarilyΓÇª
 Sorry, Lee. Are you all right?
 If Lee hadnΓÇÖt been wearing his weights, his ankle would have been crushed.
 It was a splendid move. Well then, letΓÇÖs continue with the practice.
 LetΓÇÖs stop here for today.
 IΓÇÖll take you to the hospital to have them look at it.
 No, IΓÇÖm completely fine, I tell youΓÇª
 We knew from the health check-up
 that Bushy BrowΓÇÖs injuries were considerable to begin with, didnΓÇÖt we?
 Considerable!
 What was considerable?
 IΓÇÖm telling you, just considerable, right?!
 ΓÇô Probably considerableΓÇª ΓÇô Considerable, I tell you!
 Even with the weights on, that speedΓÇª
 What was considerable?!
 Fortunately, thereΓÇÖs nothing wrong with the bone.
 I see.
 UmΓÇª When can I begin training again?
 Huh? What are you saying?!
 YouΓÇÖre going to need complete rest for a while.
 ItΓÇÖs amazing that your Achilles tendon  remained uninjured, you knowΓÇª
 You said considerable, soΓÇª
 I misunderstood it to mean that he was in a considerable condition.
 ButΓÇª
 he came out from the examining room looking very down,
 so I just assumedΓÇª
 To be sure, he seems dispirited.
 He was beaten by a trainee who isnΓÇÖt even enrolled in the Academy.
 A trainee? Lee?
 Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsu for only one week.
 In any case, he was incredibly skilled, thatΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs it calledΓÇª?
 The Cross Method!
 Yes, that!
 He's a genius to deploy that at the instant!
 I hope Lee isnΓÇÖt feeling down, though.
 If he were the kind of guy to get downhearted about a thing like that,
 Lee would have quit being a Shinobi a long time ago.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 When Lee was in the Academy,
 he was told that he had neither the talent for Ninjutsu,
 nor any talent for Genjutsu.
 Had it been me, I would have given up long ago.
 But Lee got to where he is now purely through effort and persistence.
 If he can just heal his injuries,
 heΓÇÖll soon outstrip anyone with natural talent alone.
 ΓÇô ThatΓÇÖs true. ΓÇô Darn right!
 ButΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve heard that if you train too hard,
 you can wreck your body and become a decrepitΓÇª
 Don't say such a thing! YouΓÇÖre talking about Bushy Brow!
 IΓÇÖm only kidding. Just a slip of the tongue.
 ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt even say that in jest! ΓÇô Decrepit?
 I know, I know.
 But actually, we are grateful to Lee.
 Huh? Grateful?
 Yes, grateful.
 Okay, today IΓÇÖm going to teach you about self-rule.
 SelfΓÇª
 ΓÇªrule, you say?
 Yes! Yes! Yes!
 Please teach me! Me! Me!
 All right, ready?
 To all things there are principles,
 and to efficiently make use of things in daily life, human beings have rules.
 Okay, today I have something good to give you all.
 ΓÇô SomethingΓÇª 					ΓÇô ΓÇªgood?
 This!
 O-Oh!
 These tights of the type that I habitually useΓÇª!
 They have outstanding ventilation and moisture-wicking properties!
 Developed for ultimate ease of movement, it's a complete of of super-athletic wear!
 If you wear them when youΓÇÖre training, youΓÇÖll feel the difference immediately!
 You wonΓÇÖt be able to do without them!
 Next thing you know, youΓÇÖll be wearing them all the time!
 Yes, yes, yes! Please, by all means, give me a pair!
 Oh, I got a pair of those myself. They look cool, donΓÇÖt they?
 OhΓÇª Is that so?
 If it werenΓÇÖt for LeeΓÇª
 This is youth!
 This is guts!
 This is Harutaro Minami, spring chicken of the South!
 ΓÇô You got that all wrong! ΓÇô You got that all wrong!
 IΓÇÖm really glad that weΓÇÖve had Lee around.
 Yeah, me tooΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sure a C-rank mission would feel insufficient for you,
 but thereΓÇÖs nobody left to ask but you.
 Leave it to me.
 Oh, by the way, thereΓÇÖs someone IΓÇÖd like to take with meΓÇª
 Yagura!
 When my foot heals, letΓÇÖs train together aga--?
 I feel no need to take lessons from you.
 Even ruling out the fact that you were wearing weight,
 there seems to be nothing worth stealing from youΓÇª
 Stealing?
 After all, skills acquired purely through effort
 make you nothing but a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.
 What did you say?!
 As proof of that, even Sensei has given up on you.
 That canΓÇÖt be!
 Guy Sensei promised meΓÇª
 that his own Way of Ninja was to turn me into a splendid Ninja, too!
 Well then, I wonder why heΓÇÖs gone so far as to ask me
 to come on a mission with him for practical trainingΓÇª
 Not you, but me!
 You?
 Too bad. ThereΓÇÖs no way effort can win out over talent.
 Wait!
 Did Sensei really asked you toΓÇª?
 No, itΓÇªcanΓÇÖt be trueΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade!
 Wh-What is it?
 Yagura has been injured and is under protection.
 What? Guy was with him. What on earth happened?
 No! Yagura is said to have been attacked before reaching Hidden Leaf Village.
 Then the trainee Yagura that accompanied Guy isΓÇª
 A total imposter.
 Damn it, one nuisance after anotherΓÇª!
 So, these three are the ones that can be mobilized?
 What shall we do?
 Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and NarutoΓÇª
 these three go after Guy and the phony Yagura!
 Right!
 Wait!
 Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee.
 If he learns about this,
 heΓÇÖs apt to dash out, even in the shape heΓÇÖs in.
 Right!
 Are you sure that Intense Brow Sensei went this way?
 Without a doubt!
 His destination was the Land of Mountain Streams.
 He must have gone through this forest.
 ThereΓÇÖs another way to go, cutting through the mountains,
 but itΓÇÖs too dangerous.
 Yagura, are you with me?
 Yes, Guy Sensei!
 DonΓÇÖt slow down!
 Take each step after first taking the measure of the mountain terrain!
 Right!
 Lee could run through here blindfolded.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong? Yagura?
 Oh no!
 Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura!
 Yagura!
 He may be a genius, but heΓÇÖs still a traineeΓÇª
 I wonder if I expected too much from himΓÇª
 Yagura!
 What? Were you in such a place?
 Wooden Training Dummies for kung fu trainingΓÇª
 Oh myΓÇª It takes me back to my youth.
 I trained with a burning spirit on the same kinds of Wooden Dummies.
 It makes my body to just start moving uncontrollably.
 But why are there Wooden Dummies in such a place?
 Who in the worldΓÇª?
 And for what purpose?
 They move well for dummies.
 But, after all, they just look like automated dolls.
 They only have one pattern of movement,
 and no matter how many of them there are,
 their reach only extends for a diameter of 3.5 meters,
 so they cannot attack.
 What? Mister, you can move?!
 What the heck?!
 Hey? CanΓÇÖt you see anything yet? Neji!
 Even using the Byakugan, I canΓÇÖt find a single footprint.
 They canΓÇÖt have gotten that far away, can they?
 They wouldn't have used excessively dangerous mountain paths eitherΓÇª
 However they seem to be able to move,
 theyΓÇÖre just stick figures crawling over the surface of the groundΓÇª
 Mister, you can jump, too?!
 Not just yet!
 Wh-What aΓÇª!
 pleasant, high-energy training placeΓÇª!

 ΓÇô my upper half is still in good shape. ΓÇô 6,994ΓÇª
 ΓÇô Guy Sensei thinksΓÇª ΓÇô 6,995ΓÇª
 ΓÇô my training is inadequate. ΓÇô 6,996ΓÇª
 ΓÇô ThatΓÇÖs why he compared me with Yagura. ΓÇô 6,997ΓÇª 6,996ΓÇª

 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs from that coke I just drank?
 I thought I knew, but you do have incredible power, after all.
 To think you have such an amazing kick.
 Looks like I have to put out everything in myself.
 Then I would put everything I've got into this too.
 Fine! Why donΓÇÖt  you come at me with intent to beat me?!
 Please forgive me Guy Sensei.

 As long as the score isnΓÇÖt settled,
 the clock inside my heart will remain stopped in the past!
 Lord Sagi, if you live for revenge,
 your heart will sink into darkness!
 If it means that I am able to carry out my revengeΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt care if my heart sinks into darkness!
 ThatΓÇÖs exactly right.
 I hold a grudge against you, I hate youΓÇª
 My only purpose in living has been to kill youΓÇª
 Sasuke!

 IΓÇÖve survived!
 IΓÇÖm finished with messing around with you Leaf Village guys.
 I will go to Orochimaru!
 I canΓÇÖtΓÇªlet you go thereΓÇª

 I wasnΓÇÖt able to stop a comrade who was sinking into darknessΓÇª
 However, I wonΓÇÖt let you go there, no matter what!
 You pesky littleΓÇª
 If you get in my way, IΓÇÖll consider you an enemy too!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you guysΓÇª could ever understand!
 ItΓÇÖs a trick device!
 No one can hinder my desire!
 What was that?!
 ItΓÇÖs no good!
 We canΓÇÖt get out!
 Farewell! Ninja of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Lightning Blade!
 There!
 How did you figure it outΓÇª?!
 Because IΓÇÖve seen your Jutsu with these very eyesΓÇª
 I remember nowΓÇª 					You areΓÇª
 HatakeΓÇªKakashiΓÇª
 The Copy Ninja with the SharinganΓÇª
 Your Jutsu doesnΓÇÖt even faintly mirror that of GaaraΓÇÖsΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve only scratched its surfaceΓÇª
 All youΓÇÖre doing is leaving your main body elsewhere
 and using your Chakra to manipulate the rocks and sandΓÇª
 We are nomadsΓÇª
 ridiculed as lower-ranked Shinobi without a villageΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why we travel around the country, stealing Jutsu, sharpening our skills,
 struggling to one day find our way into a place in the sun.
 But no matter how dedicated our efforts areΓÇª
 to think there are dimensions that cannot be transgressedΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the direction of the Feudal LordΓÇÖs palaceΓÇª
 Hurry up! Lord SagiΓÇÖs thought to be buried beneath there!
 Damn it! We really got screwedΓÇª
 That jerk!
 What a jerkΓÇª Gimme a break!
 What happenedΓÇª
 Huh?
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Sagi totally squashed us just now and went off somewhere!
 Gimme a breakΓÇª that guyΓÇÖs some kind of jerk!
 Please donΓÇÖt blame him for the things he has done.
 ButΓÇª!
 He is himself, but not himself right now.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 He is obsessed with avenging
 his father and younger sisterΓÇÖs deaths.
 I believe he is possessed by the ghost of the late Lord Owashi.
 Oh come onΓÇª Stop jokingΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not necessarily a joke.
 Stop it! That kind of thing gives me the creeps!
 Get a grip! This isnΓÇÖt the time to be squabbling over things like that!
 WhatΓÇÖs important right now is to find Sagi!
 But we have no idea where he went.
 If he is possessed,
 it is certain that he will return to take revengeΓÇª
 And moreoverΓÇªvery soonΓÇª
 Elder BrotherΓÇªlf I were to lose you too, after having lost our fatherΓÇª
 I could not go on livingΓÇª
 FatherΓÇªElder BrotherΓÇª
 I shall join with youΓÇª
 Elder Brother!
 Elder BrotherΓÇª I will avenge this without failΓÇª
 I will once more restart the hands of time for you, Elder Brother,
 whose time was brought to a standstillΓÇª
 Until the day that wish is realizedΓÇª
 I will live as you, Elder Brother, as Sagi!
 SagiΓÇÖs temperament is such that he will undoubtedly come here for Moso.
 ItΓÇÖs actually quite convenient
 that Lord Sagi comes all the way here to see meΓÇª
 Even if I canΓÇÖt get my hands on Sagi, the Feudal Lord,
 itΓÇÖs not a crime to kill him as the Cursed Warrior.
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 What a jokeΓÇª A ghost appearing in a childΓÇÖs toyΓÇª
 You have some nerve appearing here like thisΓÇª
 Cursed WarriorΓÇª
 Lord SagiΓÇª
 HuhΓÇªwho are youΓÇª?
 ArenΓÇÖt you the high and mighty Moso?
 I won't answer to words like that
 from the likes of a ghost.
 Damn you!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 Moso is just a fictitious name used to deceive the worldΓÇª
 My name is HokiΓÇª
 The Leader who heads the Wandering NinjaΓÇª
 In place of not having a village, we the Wandering Ninja
 steal Jutsu from every village we pass through and make them our own!
 But our family has tired of living for so long as nomads.
 And we have been searching for a Land to call our home.
 I seeΓÇª
 From the very start,
 you came here to the Land of Bird with the intention of taking it over!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way that somebody like you,
 who was born destined to become a feudal lordΓÇª
 could understand the suffering of Wandering Ninja
 who do not have a homeland!
 I donΓÇÖt see a problemΓÇª
 with the Wandering Ninja seeking a safe homeland.
 After all, your father was someone who easily trusted othersΓÇª
 He never even suspected anything
 when I switched with the monk Moso, highly reputed for his virtue,
 and neared himΓÇª
 He misinterpreted my Genjutsu of deception
 as being the holy power of the virtuous Moso
 and put me on the fast trackΓÇª
 The only person who suspected me was Komei.
 I assassinated Owashi and drove Komei awayΓÇª
 Y-You jerkΓÇª so it was you, after all!
 And the last step is to kill you, Sagi.
 If I can do that, I will have accomplished what I set out to do!
 You jerk! I wonΓÇÖt forgive you!
 Revenge for my clan!
 You areΓÇª?!
 Yes, thatΓÇÖs right!
 My name is Toki!
 Lady TokiΓÇª!
 I will avenge my father and brotherΓÇÖs death!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 Look at that, TokiΓÇª Our shadows are overlapping, rightΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 With this, you wonΓÇÖt be able to move anymore!
 But I wouldnΓÇÖt have imagined that you would be the younger sister TokiΓÇª
 The Wandering Ninja will be successful in taking control of this land.
 You will die as Sagi just as you desire!
 Lady Toki! Keep your composure!
 ChishimaΓÇª
 So you were alive, huhΓÇª
 I was unaware of your feelings, Lady Toki.
 Chishima is most ashamed!
 Take this and die!
 I overheard everything just now.
 Sagi, I mean, Toki! Leave the rest to me!
 NarutoΓÇª?!
 ThatΓÇÖs not gonna happen! You will die by your own shadow!
 The shadow has nothing to do with it!
 YouΓÇÖre just under the influence of his Genjutsu!
 What?!
 Lady TokiΓÇª
 Shadow Possession is ShikamaruΓÇÖs Clan's Secret Jutsu!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you could even hope to imitate it!
 Not only is your identity fake, but your Ninjutsu is too!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Naruto!
 The heavens are watching your villainy!
 There is no way we will forgive you!
 Why you Leaf NinjaΓÇª But itΓÇÖs only a Clone Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 They have substances?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 SasukeΓÇÖs Phoenix Flower Jutsu is much more awesome!
 ItΓÇÖs my turn this time!
 Damn you!
 Kakashi HatakeΓÇª
 So youΓÇÖre here too, huhΓÇª
 Hoki, the leader who heads the Wandering ShinobiΓÇªhuhΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve heard rumors about youΓÇª
 So youΓÇÖre a Shinobi who wanders from place to place like a batΓÇª
 Ninja from a rich village canΓÇÖt possibly imagine circumstances like oursΓÇª
 Like hell IΓÇÖll understand itΓÇª
 The Leaf are taught that the Way of Ninja is to become a Ninja who can endureΓÇª
 People like you who trick people and wishfully try to seize land
 have no right to call themselves Shinobi!
 Elitist!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Damn! ThatΓÇÖs a real dragon!
 No way!
 WaitΓÇª!
 Wait!
 Over there, huhΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs up with that?
 So the Summoning Dragons were fake too ΓÇª
 He fled off somewhereΓÇª
 Inside the mansion!
 IΓÇÖm not letting him get away!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hey youΓÇªwait!
 Where did he vanish to?!
 Hey, Leaf NinjaΓÇª
 Huh?!
 Wh-What?!
 If you want to have Toki back, come over hereΓÇª
 H-How?!
 Take that boat to come over hereΓÇª
 Genjutsu?
 Are you scared, you Leaf apprentice Ninja?
 IΓÇÖm not an apprentice!
 This placeΓÇªdonΓÇÖt tell me itΓÇÖsΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 ChishimaΓÇª
 believed in you until the very end.
 He truly loved this landΓÇª
 and he worried about his friends from the bottom of his heart!
 And yetΓÇª
 And yetΓÇª!

 Is it so sudden you canΓÇÖt tell?
 ItΓÇÖs me. Orochimaru.
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª Have you completed that Forbidden Jutsu?
 I struggled for decadesΓÇª after leaving the village.
 YouΓÇÖre a truly frightening, inhuman monster!
 So, he did it, huhΓÇª?
 The reason I couldnΓÇÖt select you to be the Fourth HokageΓÇª
 is because of that distorted consciousness.
 IΓÇÖve finally been found out, ehΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs too bad.
 OrochimaruΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this?!
 Here IΓÇÖd set that many booby trapsΓÇª
 so I was quite surprised.
 But I seeΓÇª So it was you.
 Recently, there has been a steady stream of people going missing from the village,
 from Genin to Chunin, and even Anbu Black Ops members.
 There was also information that you had been acting strangeΓÇª
 Master OrochimaruΓÇª
 Why did a Shinobi of your rank do such a thing?
 Shall I kill you, too?
 Orochimaru! Sure enough, this was your doingΓÇª?
 Say it! What were you doing here?!
 Alas! IΓÇÖve been found out.
 ThereΓÇÖs no point in acting cuteΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs for Jutsu development!
 OrochiΓÇª You!
 For that purpose, you did this to fellow ShinobiΓÇª?!
 As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, ehΓÇª
 What is it that you want?
 I want everything!
 Everything, you say?!
 Get every Jutsu and understand all of the truths of this world!
 The one who first mixed blue and yellow
 named the new color made in that way, green.
 I just want to do the same thing.
 If blue is Chakra, yellow is a SignΓÇª
 and green is a Jutsu.
 In the same way that there are no limits to the kinds of colors,
 there are probably also tens of thousands of Jutsu in this worldΓÇª
 But in order to get any and all of the JutsuΓÇª
 as well as the truths, a long time is necessary.
 ItΓÇÖs the one who takes those long years to know everything,
 who can suitably be called the ultimate individual.
 For me, the life span of the body is too short.
 Too fleeting.
 Even if I were to be called the Hokage, if I die, it all ends there.
 OrochimaruΓÇª Could it be that the Jutsu youΓÇÖre testing here isΓÇª
 RightΓÇª It sure could beΓÇª
 Immortality Jutsu!
 Immortality Jutsu is a technique of
 eternally pooling oneΓÇÖs own spirits into this earthΓÇª
 In other words, itΓÇÖs a Revival Jutsu whereΓÇª
 you find a new body, put your own spirit into that body and take it over.
 I assumed my old form until now,
 so that you would feel nostalgic about our reunionΓÇª
 Aging is an empty thing, isnΓÇÖt it?
 I feel that keenly when I look at you.
 YouΓÇÖll die hereΓÇª
 and IΓÇÖll get a younger, more beautiful and stronger bodyΓÇª
 The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of funΓÇª
 I get itΓÇª You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!
 RightΓÇª ExactlyΓÇª Sasuke.
 A Reviving Jutsu where someone elseΓÇÖs body is stolen
 and the spirit is immortalized, huh?
 How many faces and bodies have you gone through?!
 Two, I thinkΓÇª
 I plan to take Sasuke over after raising him a little more to my liking.
 But after all, in order to make you regret your very own lifeΓÇª
 and curse destiny as you dieΓÇª
 ΓÇªperhaps this face is better?
 You monster!
 Lord Hokage!
 DonΓÇÖt lower your guard, Sensei! YouΓÇÖre always too softΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs been wrong with you? This isnΓÇÖt like you!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 EyesΓÇª
 Eyes with malice and ambition concealed in themΓÇª
 I had noticed that you had such tendencies.
 I had noticed, but pretended not to know.
 It was still during the war-torn era.
 A genius who brimmed over strongly with abilityΓÇª
 Nothing less than a phenomenon that comes once in several decades.
 So I wanted to think that
 you would carry on my own will and power.
 That softness on my partΓÇª
 created the conditions of that time as well as now!
 Are you going toΓÇªkill me?
 Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!
 I wonder if you canΓÇª Sarutobi Sensei!
 Kill him, Sarutobi! NowΓÇÖs your only chance!
 SarutobiΓÇª YouΓÇª
 I couldnΓÇÖt kill himΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll bury you and correct my old mistakes, now!
 Here I go!
 ItΓÇÖs too late!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 No way! Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 To disperse the little Chakra he has leftΓÇª!
 YouΓÇÖve gotten old, after allΓÇª
 To think youΓÇÖd shorten your own life span out of impatienceΓÇª
 D-DonΓÇÖt tell me, youΓÇª?!
 Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, MiΓÇª
 This order of SignsΓÇª
 I knew it, Sarutobi, you are using that Jutsu!
 So this is the Grim Reaper the Fourth Hokage was talking about,
 which only the one who has signed a contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!
 Whatever you do now, itΓÇÖs too lateΓÇª IΓÇÖve won.
 The Leaf Village will crumble!
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves is the home where I live.
 The Hokage exists as the pillar to protect that home!
 The Hokage is the one who inherits and is entrusted the will of the Leaf.
 I wonΓÇÖt go easily!
 Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!
 Stupid nonsenseΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre merely a temporal head
 in the history of the organization called the Leaf VillageΓÇª
 Even the face rock that is left will eventually weather and decay.
 HumphΓÇª Leaf Village is not just an organization to me!
 In the Leaf Village,
 every year many Shinobi are born and raisedΓÇª
 and live and fightΓÇª and die to protect the village.
 The people of this villageΓÇª
 even if they donΓÇÖt have blood tiesΓÇª
 To me, they are preciousΓÇª
 preciousΓÇª
 family!
 Then I shall smash you, the pillar, and destroy the Leaf home.
 Humph! Even if you kill me, that pillar will not break!
 I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will of the First and Second HokagesΓÇª
 The Third Hokage!
 No matter how much you target this Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 A new Hokage will carry on my will, shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!
 Right, Fourth Hokage?
 Orochimaru! Now I will perform an ace Jutsu that even you donΓÇÖt know!
 Behold! Sealing Jutsu! Reaper Death Seal!
 Everyone makes mistakes ltΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught
 LetΓÇÖs go carve the badges in our chest Yes, itΓÇÖs Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  ItΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Every year in this village,
 Shinobi are born, nurtured, and fight for the sake of the village.
 They live to protect the village and things that are precious to them.
 Even if they arenΓÇÖt related to me, they are my precious family.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you have your way with my family!

16,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 This is good!
 Bit by bit, I'm figuring out the timing...
 He read my movement.
 No way could he do that!
 Darn! 					We were so close...!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spent... and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him,  we found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah! Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 Run out of here and attack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able toΓÇª!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limit to that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that, he's little by littleΓÇª
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while since I've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calmΓÇªThink... What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 The Broken Seal
 That was Sakura's voice!
 Did something happen?
 What's that Kakashi doing?
 SaΓÇªkuraΓÇª
 Darn itΓÇª I must do somethingΓÇª
 I'll do something about itΓÇª
 T-This guy...
 Here I goΓÇª
 It's pointless to struggle.
 Naruto, behind you!!
 Naruto!
 It's impossible for you to get out of here.
 I mean it.
 Can you stand up, Naruto?
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 From now on, don't waste your Chakra!
 You're playing right into his hands.
 I know.
 Darn it!
 If things continue like this, it's going to be really bad.
 I...
 I have to do something.
 Strangely, my eyes have adjustedΓÇª
 It's about the time I put an end to this for youΓÇª
 What?!
 Stand up, you idiot!
 I'm aiming for a vital spot... but he's parrying all of them .
 I knowΓÇª you're so persistent!
 A coincidenceΓÇª No, that's not it.
 On the contrary, he's fighting while covering for his friend.
 Surely, my movementsΓÇª
 That boyΓÇªhe can see something.
 What in the world...?
 Okay, in that case...
 He disappeared.
 Where, where did he disappear to?!
 Naruto! Don't faint!
 I can't take care of you any more than I am now!
 Who asked you to take care of me...
 It seems that kid has reached his limits.
 Tsk...
 AmazingΓÇª That's an amazing move.
 You move wellΓÇª
 Wha--?!
 But I'll stop you with the next one.
 Motor function...
 Reflexes... Ability to judge a situation...
 All of these thingsΓÇª should be at their limits!
 He's coming!
 Calm downΓÇª
 Focus!
 And ΓÇª 					See everything!
 He saw through absolutely everything?!
 No wayΓÇª
 Those eyesΓÇª
 It can't beΓÇª
 SharinganΓÇª
 You areΓÇª
 Only a little, but...
 I was able to see!
 So, you also have the power of Kekkei GenkaiΓÇª
 What a kidΓÇª
 It's not perfect yet,
 but to think that in the middle of a battle he was able to rouse this powerΓÇª
 If that's the case, I can't fight him too longΓÇª
 This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 There are also limits to retaining the teleportation speed.
 Besides, the longer the fight continues,
 the more my movements will enter into the range of his ""reading.""
 In fact, his eyes have already captured me.
 It would be foolish to aim straight at him.
 In that caseΓÇª
 I'll use that kid to lure him in!
 What?!
 Let me make it in time!
 K-Kakashi Sensei!
 You were late entering to guard, Kakashi.
 Your whole-hearted intent to help those kids has gone to your head,
 and it seems to have clouded your Sharingan
 with even heavier fog.
 Even though you have those impressive eyes,
 your ability to read your enemy's movements is getting cloudy.
 Amuse me more, KakashiΓÇª
 I want to repay my debt in an amusing way.
 Don't worry. Anytime now, Haku is going to defeat those kids.
 You better apologize to them in tears
 when you are in ""the next world"" for your lack of strength.
 Sasuke will be defeatedΓÇª?
 That's not true!
 Sasuke isΓÇª
 Cha!
 Not by that guy!
 Cha!
 He won't be defeated!
 Cha!
 Naruto won't either!
 That's right.
 Huh!
 I...believe in their strength.
 Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive, Knucklehead NinjaΓÇª
 And Sasuke is a member of the most excellent clan
 in the Hidden Leaf Village!
 That can't be!
 YesΓÇª His name is Sasuke UchihaΓÇª
 He bears within his body...
 the famous Kekkei Genkai of the Uchiha clan!
 He's a Ninja genius.
 He's the remaining survivor of that tragic clan?!
 No wonder he grows so quickly.
 But...
 That's the same as Haku.
 Nobody has ever beaten that secret Jutsu of Haku's
 Not one person in the pastΓÇª
 Well thenΓÇª
 It's about time I settled this too, huh.
 Sakura, don't move from here.
 Uh... ahΓÇªokay!
 No, I'm going to put an end to this!
 For God's sake, youΓÇª
 just won't quitΓÇª dragging my feet, will you?
 You did it! 					Sasuke...!
 W-What kind of expression is thatΓÇª
 YouΓÇªidiotΓÇª!
 W-Why?!
 You protected meΓÇª?!
 How the hellΓÇªshould I know?
 Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!
 HmphΓÇª
 You...
 I hated youΓÇª
 Why? WhyΓÇª?
 WhyΓÇªmeΓÇª?
 I didn't ask for your help!!
 I don't knowΓÇª
 My body movedΓÇªof its own accordΓÇª
 FoolΓÇª!
 Sasuke!
 That manΓÇª
 Until I defeatedΓÇªmy brotherΓÇª
 I absolutely refused to die...
 That's what I decided, but...
 You, don't dieΓÇª
 HeΓÇª
 To protect someone dear to himΓÇª
 he would plunge in knowing it was a trapΓÇª
 He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.
 Is this the first time you faced a friend's death?
 This is the way of the ShinobiΓÇª
 Shut up!
 Even though I... hated you tooΓÇª
 I won't forgive youΓÇª
 I'm going to kill you!
 What is this Chakra?!
 It can't beΓÇª
 For Chakras to be tangible like thatΓÇª
 A-AndΓÇªwhat a ghastly Chakra that isΓÇª
 The wound on his handΓÇª lt's healing instantlyΓÇª
 This boyΓÇª
 Who in hell is heΓÇª?
 Is it ZabuzaΓÇª?
 No!
 This sinister Chakra was onceΓÇª
 It can't be!
 What isΓÇªthis Chakra?
 It feels foulΓÇª
 Kakashi? No, it's too big to be Kakashi'sΓÇª
 Who is it?
 NarutoΓÇª!
 Oh noΓÇª
 At the time like thisΓÇª
 The seal has brokenΓÇª?
 I have to hurry!
 He's coming!
 How dare you!
 You ruined Sasuke! Damn you!
 Sasuke's dreamΓÇª
 What about dream?!
 Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!
 Because of your dreamΓÇª!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 There is no way that I alone can lose in a place like this!
 Guy SenseiΓÇªplease allow it.
 It is nowΓÇª
 A time to carry through and protect oneΓÇÖs own Way of the Ninja!
 The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born
 The color of his body changedΓÇª!
 HeΓÇÖs redΓÇª?!
 WhatΓÇÖs up with him...?!
 HeΓÇÖs opened the third gate, the Gate of LifeΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs going to make his move!
 No, not yet!
 What?!
 And also,
 the fourth gate, the Gate of PainΓÇªopen!
 What an incredible guyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not as though effort alone can make this happenΓÇª
 That boyΓÇª
 is he in fact a geniusΓÇª?
 HeΓÇÖs fast!
 Gaara!
 Where are they?!
 HeΓÇÖs above!
 But we canΓÇÖt find Lee!
 Where?!
 The sand isnΓÇÖt keeping up at all!
 So itΓÇÖs the Sand Armor againΓÇª?
 Then howΓÇÖs this?!
 WhatΓÇª?!
 This Sand Armor isΓÇª
 being peeled awayΓÇª!
 YouΓÇÖre a stubborn one.
 Since it comes to thisΓÇª
 The muscles have tornΓÇª
 Is that really LeeΓÇª?
 When did he become like thisΓÇª?
 This is the end!
 The Fifth Gate of ClosingΓÇªopen!
 I canΓÇÖt defend myselfΓÇª
 Is this the movement of a human being?!
 NejiΓÇª
 This technique is my ace in the hole to take you downΓÇª
 but I will specially show it to you!
 Huh?!
 The Sand Shield canΓÇÖt keep up!
 Most of the armor has also  been peeled offΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs done for!
 W-Wow!
 Hidden LotusΓÇª In other words...
 itΓÇÖs a high-speed continuous Taijutsu that canΓÇÖt even be touched!
 The answer to take Neji down is that high speed combinationΓÇª
 There is no way that the sand can keep up!
 This technique will be the last!
 Hidden Lotus!
 I canΓÇÖt see anything, itΓÇÖs too fastΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs impossibleΓÇª

 Guy Sensei, please watch me with a smile...
 IΓÇÖd like to prove that I could become a respectable Ninja
 even though I canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 He is...
 an important subordinate whom I care for!
 A subordinateΓÇªwhom I care for...?
 Those words are definitely not understandable to GaaraΓÇª
 I quitΓÇª
 He quitΓÇª?
 The moment Guy jumped in, Lee lost.

 ΓÇô WhaΓÇª? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Wha--?!
 ThatΓÇÖs impossibleΓÇª

 And his hand and feet are crushedΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way he should be able to standΓÇª!

 ItΓÇÖs all right.
 ItΓÇÖs over!
 YouΓÇÖre in no condition to standΓÇª!

 lost consciousnessΓÇª
 Lee...
 YouΓÇÖre alreadyΓÇª
 a respectable NinjaΓÇª!
 The winnerΓÇª
 Gaara.
 Lee!
 Stop!
 Even if you went down what could you do?
 Your words of encouragement would only make him feel worse.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way he could have beaten GaaraΓÇª
 He was faced with a tougher battle than we thoughtΓÇª
 That NarutoΓÇª
 Bushy Brow lost to a guy like thisΓÇª!
 Medics, please hurry.
 Bushy BrowΓÇª
 LeeΓÇª
 You are the Jonin in charge of him, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Y-Yes.
 Please come with me for a minute.
 CarefulΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt shake him.
 There is faint breathingΓÇª
 but because of comminuted fractures and muscle tears to his entire body,
 recovery will likely to take quite some timeΓÇª
 If that was all, it wouldnΓÇÖt be so bad, butΓÇª
 The damage to the left arm and leg which received the attack is severeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs too severeΓÇª
 OhΓÇª!
 I donΓÇÖt want to say this,
 but he won't be able to... live as a Shinobi again.
 T-ThatΓÇª
 that canΓÇÖt be trueΓÇª
 I will take Bushy Brow down. Believe it!
 It is not you whom I want to fight, itΓÇÖs Uchiha!
 YouΓÇª!
 Naruto, I get where you're coming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be done officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted genius through sheer effortΓÇª
 Wouldn't that make for an exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably going  to be the one fighting NejiΓÇª
 LeeΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt want to think... that youΓÇÖd lose.
 I wanted to let you fulfillΓÇª
 your Way of the Ninja!
 Yay!
 I finally mastered it!
 Yahoo!
 This techniqueΓÇª
 after all, only Lee managed to masterΓÇª
 Okay, you became Genin  from today.
 I want to hear what it is you all are aiming for!
 I-IΓÇÖd like to prove that I can become a respectable Ninja
 even though I canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Please forgive me for notΓÇª
 stopping it...!
 LeeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not trueΓÇªitΓÇÖs not true.
 After hearing that, what should Bushy Brow doΓÇª?!
 This guyΓÇª
 He said the failure would take down a genius with effortΓÇª!
 IsnΓÇÖt there something that can be done?!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 B-ButΓÇªKakashi Sensei!
 He kept saying he wanted to battle Sasuke and Neji!
 PerhapsΓÇªthat led to his ruin.
 To fulfill that dreamΓÇª
 the boy even used a self-sacrificing forbidden technique to try to win!
 The result is what you seeΓÇª
 That boyΓÇª
 Sasuke and NejiΓÇª
 and youΓÇª
 he sacrificed himself to a promise he never spoke of.
 He risked his lifeΓÇª
 so that he might have a chance to battle you guysΓÇª
 Don't forget thatΓÇª
 I wonder if LeeΓÇª
 will be all rightΓÇª?
 LeeΓÇª
 You didnΓÇÖt realize it even at the endΓÇª
 Heaven does not allow it.
 One who tries to move ahead while achieving victory
 through a method like dying upon each otherΓÇÖs swords.
 So it ended without incidentΓÇª
 Welcome back Gaara.
 GuyΓÇª
 WellΓÇª
 I spoke self-importantly earlier butΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve thought about it and had I been in your positionΓÇª
 I probably... wouldnΓÇÖt have been able to stop him.
 Guy.
 WeΓÇÖre in the way of the next tournamentΓÇªletΓÇÖs go up.
 All rightΓÇª
 Then, the tenth and final round is next, both contestants come forward!
 So itΓÇÖs finally my turnΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm gonna win and have some barbecued beef!
 In any case, I need to last until the main tournament and battle Sasuke.
 Or I will not have met your expectations, Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 I can almost see through itΓÇª
 The reason that you went to the trouble of getting to Sasuke before us and...
 putting a Curse Mark on him without killing himΓÇª
 In other words,
 we were the guinea pigs to measure SasukeΓÇÖs abilities during the examinations.
 What you wanted isnΓÇÖt SasukeΓÇÖs life, but Sasuke himselfΓÇª
 I was also taken for a foolΓÇª
 Now, let the tenth round begin.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Sakura!
 Do you know where Kakashi Sensei is?
 Naruto...
 IΓÇÖm gonna have him watch my training until the main tournament.
 Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away

 Your bones make a really low sound, donΓÇÖt they?

 Here you are!

 This looks delicious.

 Sasuke told me not to tell you this, Naruto, butΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs all that guy OrochimaruΓÇÖs faultΓÇª
 S-Stop!
 Kakashi Sensei said it would be fine and IΓÇÖd like to believe that tooΓÇª
 But when he was battling GaaraΓÇª
 Earlier todayΓÇª
 Sasuke was wearing the same expression as the time before.
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇª
 Orochimaru, huh? I ran into him again a little while back.
 Really? Where?!
 When I was searching for Old Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Die!
 Shoot!
 Pervy Sage and the old ladyΓÇª
 Despite the fact that he was fighting two of them at once,
 he was incredibly powerful.
 HeΓÇÖs one dangerous dude.
 That strongΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll all be fine, believe it!
 Sasuke wouldnΓÇÖt fall to that kind of guyΓÇÖs enticement.
 HeΓÇÖs already a really powerful guy,
 so he wouldnΓÇÖt need to do that kind of thing!
 I guarantee it!
 Yeah!
 Why does Master Orochimaru want this guy anyway?
 Kimimaro would have been much betterΓÇª
 Well, if you stay in a seedy place like this,
 youΓÇÖll just remain mediocre at best.
 YouΓÇÖll never become strongΓÇª
 Wh-WhyΓÇª?
 All my barrages were solid. Yet this guyΓÇª
 doesn't seem to have sustained any damage.
 If you keep on fooling around playing Ninja with your friends,
 youΓÇÖre just gonna continue to rot.
 Come with us.
 If you do, Master Orochimaru will empower you.
 ThereΓÇÖs no meaning if we take you by force, he said.
 You decide.
 Gimme a breakΓÇª
 Master Orochimaru sure sent me on a bothersome mission.
 Hey! What did you decide?
 Are you coming?
 Or are you not coming?!
 Decide already!
 When a weakling like you lags,
 it makes me wanna just finish you!
 Try meΓÇª!
 YouΓÇªthose Curse MarksΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt be so sure that
 youΓÇÖre the only favorite of Master Orochimaru.
 One shouldnΓÇÖt use Curse Marks that lightly.
 Or ratherΓÇªit looks like youΓÇÖre not even able to control the Curse Marks.
 If they continue to be released for a long period of time,
 Curse Marks will progressively eat your body.
 It looks like youΓÇÖre still at first state,
 so the speed at which they will eat away at you is still fairly slow.
 But when they have entirely eaten you,
 you will lose yourself.
 Forever.
 In exchange for having been empowered by Curse Marks,
 you will be tethered by Master Orochimaru.
 We no longer have anything like freedom.
 In order to receive something, one must discard something.
 What is your objective?
 Are you and your comrades just going to comfort each other
 in this lukewarm villageΓÇª
 then simply forget all aboutΓÇª

 be able to obtain much, more fabulous power.

 IΓÇÖll walk you home!
 Huh? DonΓÇÖt worry about it.
 Why, why? The streets are dangerous at night!
 TheyΓÇÖre well lit, so IΓÇÖll be fineΓÇª
 Sakura?
 Thanks, Naruto.
 But I want to go home alone tonight.
 I seeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll be fine!
 Yeah!
 Why are you hanging around in a place like this in the middle of the night?
 One has to pass down this road to leave the village.
 Go home and sleep.
 WhyΓÇª
 Why wonΓÇÖt you tell me anything?
 Why are you always silent like that?
 You wonΓÇÖt tell me one single thing.
 Why should I have to tell you anything?!
 IΓÇÖm telling you to keep your nose out of my business.
 Stop bothering me over everything I do.

 SolitudeΓÇª

 IsnΓÇÖt the same as being scolded by oneΓÇÖs parents.

 But it all began that day.

 The four of us went on various missions, didnΓÇÖt we?
 Those were tough and difficult times, butΓÇª

 The four of us have worked together,
 but in the end, I decided on revenge.
 ThatΓÇÖs been my reason for living.

 Are you going to isolate yourself again, Sasuke?!
 You taught me that solitude is a very rough thing that time, Sasuke!
 Now I know exactly how that feels.
 I have both family and friendsΓÇª
 But if you were no longer here, SasukeΓÇª
 for meΓÇª
 for me it would be the same as solitude.
 From here againΓÇª
 weΓÇÖre going to start walking our new paths individually.
 IΓÇª!
 I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!
 If you would only be with me, Sasuke,
 I won't let you regret it, no matter what!
 IΓÇÖll make it fun every day and you will definitely find happiness!
 IΓÇÖll do anything for you, Sasuke!
 SoΓÇªIΓÇÖm begging you, please stay here!
 IΓÇÖll even help you with your revenge!
 IΓÇÖll make it happen somehow, I promise youΓÇª!
 So stay hereΓÇªwith meΓÇª!
 If that doesnΓÇÖt work for youΓÇª
 Then take me with youΓÇª
 You really areΓÇªannoying.
 DonΓÇÖt go!
 If you go, IΓÇÖll scream andΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª
 Thank youΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke.
 WhatΓÇÖs your intention?
 It was already decided that you would be our leader
 the moment you exited the village.
 Please forgive our rudeness up to now.
 I donΓÇÖt care about any of that.
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 This is the beginning!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 What? That jerk Sasuke.
 What the heck is he thinking? He has such a twisted personality!
 What is it that he disliked so much that he'd do something like this?!
 Damn! I'm not about to let that guy do whatever he wants!
 If things come to this, I'll chase him down to the end of the world.
 I'll drag that guy back even if I have to grab him by his neck!

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal

 By special, you meant that?!
 I donΓÇÖt feel like IΓÇÖm gonna lose.

 If they continue to be released for a long period of time,
 Curse Marks will progressively eat your body.
 When they have entirely eaten youΓÇª
 you will lose yourselfΓÇªforever.
 This bodyΓÇª
 It looks like thereΓÇÖs no time to waste.
 I donΓÇÖt have any feeling in my left armΓÇª
 That power you haveΓÇª
 seems to involve some risks too, huh?
 Did you knowΓÇª?
 That this placeΓÇª
 is called the Final Valley.
 I think this is the perfect stage, donΓÇÖt you thinkΓÇªNaruto?
 Oh yeahΓÇª
 I said thereΓÇÖd be no more talking, didnΓÇÖt I?
 Well, in that case, how about we bring it to a closeΓÇª?
 This battle.
 All our battles up to now!
 Next for Squad Seven. Naruto Uzumaki!
 Sakura Haruno!
 Yipeee!
 With NarutoΓÇª?
 And Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yipeee!
 With SasukeΓÇª?
 Try not to slow me down, loser.
 YouΓÇª!
 ButΓÇªbutΓÇªbutΓÇªyou told usΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why theyΓÇªΓÇª
 ArenΓÇÖt we a three-man squad?
 ThatΓÇÖs right! We three are one!
 Hey!
 Are you hurt? 					Scaredy Cat?
 HeyΓÇªare you hurt? Scaredy Cat?
 You are one of the ones I want to fight.
 Sasuke!
 I wantΓÇªto fight you, too.
 I donΓÇÖt want to see any more deaths
 of my precious comrades.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 IΓÇªwill protect Sakura!
 WhatΓÇÖs so funny?
 NothingΓÇÖs funny, believe it! I'm happy!
 When I think I can finally beat you here!
 What did you say?! Don't talk foolish, you failure!
 IΓÇÖm not going to be a failure forever!
 Just bring it, now!
 Put on your headband before that! IΓÇÖll wait.
 I donΓÇÖt need such a thingΓÇª
 Just do it!
 You wouldnΓÇÖt even be able to put one wound on my forehead!
 YouΓÇÖre wrong!
 IΓÇÖm saying this is a testament
 to fighting on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!

 IΓÇÖll win no matter what!

 ItΓÇÖs started to rain! Will it erase the scent?
 No problem.
 WeΓÇÖre already close. This way.
 Was I too lateΓÇª?
 Naruto!
 Why did things come to this?!
 This is SasukeΓÇÖsΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt make it in timeΓÇª please forgive me.
 NarutoΓÇª
 I know the kind of person you areΓÇª
 You must have made a desperate effort.
 SasukeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs my boyΓÇª
 With me, youΓÇÖre all your father talks aboutΓÇª
 You are my one and only brother.
 I will continue to be for youΓÇª
 a wall that you must find a way to cross over.
 Even if you were to hate meΓÇª
 You are someone
 who can obtain Mangekyo Sharingan just like meΓÇª
 However, on one condition.
 Your closest friendΓÇª
 The Final ValleyΓÇª
 To think that Sasuke and Naruto would battle it out hereΓÇª
 How ironicΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª
 When I look at the flow of this water,
 itΓÇÖs as if IΓÇÖm being confronted by an eternal, never-ending battleΓÇª
 Just like the fate of the two people depicted in these statues here
 who founded the Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 Naruto and Sasuke, as long as you both liveΓÇª
 You have to killΓÇª
 your closest friend!
 I'm not gonnaΓÇª
 abide by everything you say!
 I will get my hands on power doing it my own way!
 I will surpass you doing it my own way!
 Without fail!
 The rainΓÇÖsΓÇªlet up, hasnΓÇÖt it?
 Yeah.
 With that much rain,
 I wonΓÇÖt be able to pursue the scent anymore.
 Naruto is more important now than pursuing Sasuke.
 Yeah.
 ItΓÇÖs gotten interesting, hasnΓÇÖt it?
 YeahΓÇª
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry. IΓÇÖm really sorry, Sakura.
 I made a once-in-a-lifetime promise that I would bring Sasuke back.
 But, IΓÇÖm not finished yet!
 IΓÇÖll fulfill my promise, no matter what!
 Since that was what I was always sayingΓÇª
 that I wonΓÇÖt go back on my word.
 ThatΓÇÖs my Way of Ninja!

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, ΓÇ£See youΓÇªΓÇ¥
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if IΓÇÖm not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Please, Sensei!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 Whoa, my heart, my heart!
 Huh? There's nothing wrong.
 Hey, it's you again.
 To think you'd transform into Kurenai with a Transformation Jutsu.
 Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
 Shut up! For your sake, don't be nosing around needlessly.
 Hey!
 You're Yakumo. Right?
 I want to ask you something about Kurenai Sensei!
 D-Damn it!
 This isΓÇªthe Academy's hallway.
 Sensei, please!
 Yakumo's Sealed Power
 Why am I no good?!
 Kurenai Sensei?
 I want to become a Ninja, no matter what!
 I must become one!
 I told you to give up.
 No!
 Then IΓÇÖll just have to perform a Sealing Jutsu
 and seal your power.
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Why?!
 S-Sakura. Umm, where am I?!
 As for me, what am I doing lying here?!
 Oh yeah! Kurenai Sensei got stabbed
 and my heart leapt out of my chest andΓÇª
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it. WhereΓÇÖs that girl?
 WhereΓÇÖs Yakumo?
 It seems you donΓÇÖt remember at all.
 You got caught breaking into a mountain cottage
 under special security!
 HuhΓÇª?!
 The Anbu Black Ops are in action,
 so you should be thankful youΓÇÖre alive!
 Oh yeah!
 The dream I just hadΓÇª lt was strangely real.
 No doubt it was the girl in the mountain cottage!
 WhatΓÇÖre you blabbing about?!
 IΓÇÖll inject you with a stimulant if you donΓÇÖt knock it off.
 I canΓÇÖt be doing stuff like this!
 Hold it!
 The medicine hasnΓÇÖt worn off, yet!
 Sensei! Kurenai Sensei!
 KurenaiΓÇÖs already gone out.
 What?!
 YouΓÇÖve gone to the trouble of getting up early.
 So how about joining me for an early-morning marathon?
 This isnΓÇÖt the time for that!
 Morning marathons are great!
 Marathons purge the sweat and impurities built up
 in your body from a night of sleep.
 More importantly, where did Kurenai Sensei go?!
 Come to think of it,
 she said something about going to visit someoneΓÇª
 Something about a student
 she took care of in the past being in poor healthΓÇª
 Huh? She went to see Yakumo!
 Then at least join me for some morning exercise!
 Morning exercise purges the sweat and impurities built up
 in your body from a night of sleepΓÇª
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Whoa?!
 I have something I want to ask you, Kurenai Sensei.
 Naruto, donΓÇÖt stick your nose into my business any further.
 Yesterday I went to see Yakumo!
 I donΓÇÖt know if it was on account of that,
 but I just had a strangely real dream!
 A dreamΓÇª?
 Yeah.
 You said to Yakumo that you were going to use a Sealing Jutsu
 if she wouldnΓÇÖt give up becoming a NinjaΓÇª
 Sorry, but IΓÇÖm in a hurryΓÇª
 H-Hey. Wait!
 It doesnΓÇÖt concern youΓÇª
 Yes, it does!
 Hinata, Kiba and Shino are all troubled
 because you said you were going to quit!
 DoesnΓÇÖt the fact that youΓÇÖre quitting Squad Eight
 have something to do with that girl Yakumo?!
 What you saw wasnΓÇÖt just a dreamΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª?!
 I used a Sealing Jutsu and took away a studentΓÇÖs power!
 No way. That couldnΓÇÖt be!
 It happened over a year agoΓÇª
 By my own hand, I crushed the dream of a girlΓÇª
 I tutored individually named YakumoΓÇª
 who was trying to become a practitioner of Genjutsu.
 No way!
 I donΓÇÖt deserve to have the lives of the Genin
 in Squad Eight entrusted to me.
 But whyΓÇª?
 Now, get out of my way!
 ThatΓÇÖs the end of this conversation.
 No wayΓÇª But I still have stuff I want to ask youΓÇª!
 I have no choice.
 What's happening?!
 They wonΓÇÖt come off!
 Kurenai Sensei, thatΓÇÖs just cruel!
 WeΓÇÖre already surroundedΓÇª
 Make emergency contact with the villageΓÇª
 Yes, sir.
 There!
 What?!
 WeΓÇÖre counting on you!
 What?!
 HurryΓÇªto the Hokage!
 YakumoΓÇª Come with us.
 Geez, that Naruto.
 The least he could do is thank me for attending to him all night.
 What?!
 IsnΓÇÖt it about tea time?
 After youΓÇÖve taken care of these documents!
 WhyΓÇÖs there so much work?
 ItΓÇÖs because you didnΓÇÖt take care of it lickety-split, Lady Tsunade.
 ItΓÇÖs a carrier pigeon for emergency contacts!
 What?!
 ItΓÇÖs from the mountain cottage in Satomi HillΓÇª
 SomethingΓÇÖs happened to Yakumo!
 ThereΓÇÖs a possibility that a person being protected
 by the Village Hidden in Leaves, Yakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped.
 Head for the mountain cottage in Satomi Hill and secure Yakumo.
 Yakumo KuramaΓÇª
 As I recall, thatΓÇÖs the girl Kurenai took custody of, right?
 Yes, the only daughter of Murakumo of the Kurama Clan head family.
 Umm, whatΓÇÖs the Kurama Clan?
 ItΓÇÖs natural that you guys wouldnΓÇÖt know.
 They were a distinguished family
 that wielded considerable power in the village,
 but theyΓÇÖre just a shadow of what they used to be.
 The death of Murakumo and his wife about a year ago
 became the catalyst for that.
 I hear that the clan fell apart after that.
 Does the kidnapping of the only daughter of the head family mean
 that the Kurama ClanΓÇÖs Secret Jutsu is being targeted?
 WellΓÇª
 According to the documents
 handed down from the Third Hokage,
 it seems her latent powers as a Genjutsu Ninja
 are extremely dangerousΓÇª
 In other words, she would make for a powerful asset
 if those powers can be awakened.
 That means it wouldnΓÇÖt be surprising
 if there were guys seeking that power, huh?
 After her parents died,
 she was kept under protective custody in the village.
 All right. Leave it to me!
 I wonΓÇÖt allow a girl to cry!
 Might Guy, the Leaf Village's Handsome Devil
 will rescue her, no matter what!
 Sakura, you go with them as well.
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Once we have her in custody,
 weΓÇÖll need someone to look after her condition.
 Only one with experience as a Medical Ninja can do this.
 Y-Yes maΓÇÖam!
 This mission is a chance to show my master
 the fruits of my training!
 Ouch!
 Ouch? Did you trip on a tree root or something?
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 N-NarutoΓÇª!
 He fell asleep in a place like this?!
 Nice, Akamaru!
 NarutoΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖsΓÇªcaught in a Genjutsu!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Release!
 WhatΓÇª? SakuraΓÇª
 Salty!
 What the hell is this?! I mean, was I asleep again?
 WhatΓÇÖre you babbling about?!
 You were caught in a Genjutsu.
 GenjutsuΓÇª
 I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei
 who was heading for the Satomi mountain cottage
 and I tried to get her to listen to me.
 Satomi mountain cottage, you say?
 Then Kurenai went alone?
 Yeah, probably.
 KurenaiΓÇÖs in danger
 if she went without being aware whatΓÇÖs happening!
 Huh?
 SomethingΓÇÖs strangeΓÇª
 SomeoneΓÇÖs here!
 Damn it. Was it a mistake to come aloneΓÇª?
 But I donΓÇÖt have the time to return to the villageΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖre most likely afterΓÇªYakumo.
 What?!
 Oh no!
 Sorry, but I mustnΓÇÖt allow you to interfere with our work.
 Wha--?!
 You think you caught me with that?
 What?!
 YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs caught!
 The enemies are also practitioners of Genjutsu.
 I must not loseΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs this presence?!
 TheyΓÇÖre both caught in a Genjutsu.
 YakumoΓÇª Is that you, Yakumo?
 So you were safe!
 Help me!
 ItΓÇÖs okay now, Yakumo.
 IΓÇÖll protect you, no matter what.
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Release!
 You were hit with a reverse Genjutsu, eh?
 I-IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect from a JoninΓÇª
 No, I should probably say Kurenai YuhiΓÇª
 Stay alert!
 We should consider ourselves
 as being under suspicion by the Leaf Village.
 ΓÇô Yes, sir! 					ΓÇô Yes, sir!
 The two who took Yakumo havenΓÇÖt returnedΓÇª
 I guess somewhat violent action canΓÇÖt be avoided.
 Although we come from the same villageΓÇª
 we will get Yakumo, no matter what the cost.
 Understood?
 ΓÇô Yes, sir! 					ΓÇô Yes, sir!
 Oh!
 What is it, Hinata?!
 Did you see something?
 The mountain cottage is being attacked by someone.
 There are four out front and four inside the mountain cottage.
 Are two of the people inside the mountain cottage
 Kurenai and Yakumo?
 I bet thatΓÇÖs it!
 Kurenai Sensei, what the hell happened?!
 Tell us!
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 IΓÇÖm surprisedΓÇª
 Who wouldΓÇÖve thought that
 the intruders would turn out to be you people.
 But whatever reasons you may have, I wonΓÇÖt let you take Yakumo!
 The Third Hokage entrusted this child to me.
 Even if you are experts in Genjutsu,
 I will protect this child with every ounce of strength I have in my body.

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 Hey you, failure.
 I have two pieces of advice for you.
 First, if you intend to call yourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And second...
 a failure will always be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you're coming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be done officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted genius through sheer effortΓÇª
 Wouldn't that make for an exciting main battle?
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee: The Power of Youth Explodes!
 Hey, Choji!
 You're in trouble.
 Only the strong ones are left.
 Probably the strongest of Hidden Sound must be that bloke.
 And Lee is apparently strong enough to take on Sasuke!
 And particularly that Sand guy!
 He's probably the most dangerous one!
 I-I don't care!
 I plan to forfeit right away if that happensΓÇª
 So that meansΓÇª
 Huh?
 ...you plan to forego all-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
 What? Come on!
 DonΓÇÖt worry.
 If things start getting ugly,
 I'll step in and stop the fight, like I did for Hinata. Okay?
 Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
 ΓÇô You can eat what you want. ΓÇô Don't dangle food in front of him!
 ΓÇô Besides he didn't step in... ΓÇô You can eat whatever you want...
 ΓÇô and stop the fight for Hinata. ΓÇô and all you want.
 B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q! All you can eat!
 He doesn't look good.
 Watching the previous fightΓÇª
 Did it get stirred up?
 His inner demon!
 IΓÇÖm curious about that guy, Neji, tooΓÇª
 Here's a plan.
 Kankuro?
 Just a little information-gathering mission.
 Hey!
 Huh?
 What are you doing here all by yourself?
 Shouldn't you be with your friends?
 I-It's none of your business, is it?!
 Hmmm. Well, wellΓÇª
 That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?
 Well, it seems to me that
 he didn't reveal the true extent of his power in that last match.
 What's he about?
 I'm going to crush him!
 Err, that's not what I was asking.
 Besides, this guyΓÇÖs way out of his league...
 You seem like a fun guy. I quite like you.
 You're dull. And I don't like you at all!
 I'm going to waste this guy!
 We will now resume the battle.
 Okay!
 You'll be up this time for sure. Go for it, Lee!
 No!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô What?
 Seeing as I've come this far, I rather be the last!
 Is Lee sulking?
 Hurry up and get down hereΓÇª
 Safe!
 ΓÇô Hey! ΓÇô Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee
 Oh! Lee!
 It worked!
 If you say you want to go last, then you won't be last.
 It's an application of the same law
 that says a stone thrown to hit a telephone pole will miss,
 and a stone thrown to miss will be a direct hit!
 Right! That's my student!
 I absolutely did not want to go last!
 I threw them a beauty of a curve!
 Threw whom a curve?
 Okay, so let me give you a little piece of ΓÇ£niceΓÇ¥ advice.
 Right!
 Probably no one has noticed yet, butΓÇª
 That gourd is suspicious!
 I see!
 Quit with the notes!
 You're not going to have time to read them during the match! Fool!
 I see!
 He didn't realize that?
 Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
 All right! 					Go! Lee!
 Yeah!
 I am very happy to be squaring off with you so early in the match.
 I don't know what kind of moves that bowl-cut guy has,
 but he will never take Gaara.
 Never!
 He's fast, to be sure, but his kick is not all that great.
 NoΓÇª
 He's... strong!
 Please don't be in such a hurry.
 LeeΓÇª
 Be careful, Lee.
 Now thenΓÇª The 9th match...
 Begin!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Is thatΓÇª?
 Sand?
 What an unusual JutsuΓÇª
 There's sand in his gourd!
 That'sΓÇª
 That's it?
 Desert Coffin!
 Desert Burial!
 Not another horror story like thatΓÇª
 A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
 Sounds like trouble.
 But let's give it a go!
 Even that LeeΓÇÖs fast strikesΓÇª
 have no effect at all!
 What's the deal?!
 No physical strike is going to have any effect on him.
 What?
 The Sand shields and protects Gaara
 on its own accord, independently of any intent on Gaara's part.
 That's why... no one has been able to do it so far....
 Injure Gaara, that is.
 Curses! He's not moving a muscle and still...!
 Is that it?
 Entertain me a bit moreΓÇª
 There's not enough yet!
 Blood!
 Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
 He'll never be able to get close enough for that!
 Why doesn't he step back a bit and use Ninjutsu or something?
 ItΓÇÖs not that he doesn't use it.
 He canΓÇÖt use it.
 Huh?
 Lee has almost no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills.
 N-No way!
 When I first met Lee, he was completely inept.
 He had no talent whatsoever.
 What? I can't believe that!
 Hey hey!
 CertainlyΓÇª
 A ninja who canΓÇÖt do Ninjutsu and Genjutsu is a rarity.
 ThatΓÇÖs why, the only path open to Lee as a Ninja was Taijutsu.
 But! That's precisely what makes him a winner!
 Huh?
 Lee, take them off!
 B-But Guy Sensei...!
 You told me only to do that
 to protect a large group of very important people!
 ThatΓÇÖs quite all right!
 I give you permission!
 Are thoseΓÇª?
 Weights?
 That's some clich├⌐ trainingΓÇª
 I see!
 Ridiculous!
 All right, now I can move easily!
 Humph! Does he think removing some measly little weights
 is going to enable him to outmaneuver Gaara's sandΓÇª?
 A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
 Go, Lee!
 Right!
 Go!
 Very close!
 Fast!
 AmazingΓÇª!
 Because he can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu...
 Therefore, he channeled all of his time,
 all of his energy and...
 all of his being into Taijutsu.
 Though he canΓÇÖt do any other JutsuΓÇª
 He won't lose to anyoneΓÇª
 He is a Taijutsu specialist!
 I can't believe it! Gaara's been injured!
 No way...!
 Bushy-Brows is even faster than before!
 Was he this strong?!
 Youth is... explosion!
 Right!
 Over here!
 Good!
 I got him good!
 A-Amazing, he's so fast!
 The Sand Shield can't keep up with him!
 A direct hit!
 A-Amazing.
 His strikes are lightning fastΓÇª!
 I can't even track him with my eyes!
 Uh ohΓÇª
 Uh oh is right!
 That black-circles-under-the-eye guy is taking some serious blows!
 That's not what I meant.
 Huh?
 W-What theΓÇª?!
 His face is crumbling right offΓÇª!
 His whole body is covered with sandΓÇª.
 There's not a scratch on him!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs with this guy?!
 Sure enough, he was encased in sand, eh.
 But, it's been a long time since
 I've seen that expression on Gaara's face.
 I felt that he was becoming more and more unstable
 as the Chunin Exam progressedΓÇª
 So Gaara's other self has been awakened, eh?
 Hey! What is that?
 That protected him against Bushy-Brow's strikes?
 YesΓÇª It's Sand Armor.
 Armor?
 Ordinarily, the Sand Shield functions to protect him automatically,
 but, if by chance, the Shield is penetrated,
 the Sand Armor functions as a second layer of protection against strikesΓÇª
 That's Gaara'sΓÇªabsolute defense!
 Well then, there's no way to get him!
 He doesn't have any weak points.
 No. ThatΓÇÖs not entirely trueΓÇª
 The Sand Armor is actually riddled with weak points.
 First of all, because it's not automatic, it uses up a lot of Chakra.
 It's also less effective than the Sand Shield,
 and it takes an enormous amount of physical energy
 to keep the sand clinging to the body like that.
 Gaara's having to use the armor... is proof that he's under pressure.
 That Lee is really goodΓÇª
 But, the outcome of the match is already a given.
 He will never beat Gaara!
 Is that all?
 But what an incredible defense he has...
 no amount of speed is going to let me get a strike through.
 I'll have to do major damage from above the sand guard.
 That will be Lotus!
 Yes.
 Be ready!
 A thin sand guard like that will be inconsequential
 in the face of Lee's high-speed Lotus slamming down from above.
 Hurry up and bring it on!
 You asked for it!
 He didnΓÇÖt float.
 Not just yet!
 What an amazing series of kicks!
 Even an ordinary Lotus has a tremendous strain on the bodyΓÇª!
 Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 I got him...
 good!
 Right on!
 I-It's over!
 W-What? This canΓÇÖt be!
 He did it! LeeΓÇÖs won!
 Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
 Wha--?!
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
 All of your strength seems to have disappeared!
 You're going to be destroyed at this rate!
 But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
 How can he continue to keep up a fighting stance
 when he's being routed like this?!
 Next episode: ""LeeΓÇÖs Hidden Strength: Forbidden Secret Jutsu!""
 The expression in Bushy-BrowsΓÇÖ eyes has changed!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied

 HeyΓÇª Closet pervert.
 Leaf Village Secret Finger JutsuΓÇª
 One Thousand Years of Death!
 HeΓÇÖs totally knocked outΓÇª HeΓÇÖs weak, sure enough.
 WhatΓÇÖs with that big frog? What the heck are you?
 Thank you for asking me!
 Know me as the Mountain ToadΓÇª spirit sage who acquires immortality,
 also commonly called the Toad Mountain Sage.
 Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!
 M-Mountain Sage?
 Exactly.
 HeyΓÇªPervy Sage, whatΓÇÖre you going to do about this?
 Here, he was supposed to watch my training.
 You did that to him.
 He interfered with my research.
 Research?
 IΓÇÖm a writer. IΓÇÖm writing a novel.
 This is it.
 Make-Out Paradise
 Oh, that isΓÇª!
 You know this?
 IΓÇÖve gotten quite famous.
 ThatΓÇÖs not much of a novel!
 In the first place, what research you are talking about?
 YouΓÇÖre just peeking at the girlsΓÇÖ bath!
 ΓÇô Yikes! 					ΓÇô No!
 Idiot, idiotΓÇªidiot! My peeking has been found out.
 You pervert.
 F-Fool! IΓÇÖm not just a pervert.
 I get inspired by peeking and can write better pieces.
 Liar! No excuses.
 More importantly, whatΓÇÖre you going to do about my training?
 You mean the walking-on-water technique you were doing earlier?
 You know it?
 Then take responsibility and join my training.
 Humph. I donΓÇÖt care about such things.
 Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!
 Join my training, hey!
 Shut up! I hate people who donΓÇÖt know how to talk properlyΓÇª
 And I donΓÇÖt like men.
 Oh, umm, ummΓÇª
 That Make-Out Paradise was really exciting, cool and interesting.
 The purchase or viewing of that novel is prohibited for those 18 years or youngerΓÇª
 You liar.
 The reviews that IΓÇÿve heard are great.
 ItΓÇÖs useless to flatter me. IΓÇÖm a sage!
 IΓÇÖm not the type of fool who can be coaxed by a fledgling like you.
 Oh, heyΓÇªwait!
 Farewell, kid.
 Wow! HeΓÇÖs cool even though heΓÇÖs a pervert.
 Heeey, Pervy Sage!
 WhereΓÇÖd he go?
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, you old pervert?
 No, no, IΓÇÖm sorry, missΓÇª but what lovely breastsΓÇª
 Pervert!
 This grown-up is disgraceful.
 Maybe thereΓÇÖs nothing special about him, after all.
 But thereΓÇÖs nobody else.
 Good griefΓÇª
 As usual, the women in this village are strong-minded.
 However, thatΓÇÖs makes them so good.
 ΓÇ£As usualΓÇ¥? Meaning youΓÇÖve come here before?
 You.
 And you did nothing but peeping, rightΓÇª?
 You Pervy Sage!
 DonΓÇÖt say pervert, pervert in such a loud voice.
 Shut up!
 So I bet that one shot on the closet pervert was a flukeΓÇª
 Anyway, IΓÇÖll have you take responsibility for ruining my training! WhoaΓÇª
 Jeez, youΓÇÖre a noisy brat.
 Hey!
 Be quiet inside here for awhile.
 Hey! Let me out, you jerk!
 I want to have a romantic encounter with a stacked girl.
 How dare you do that to me earlier!
 Substitution Jutsu.
 Sure enough, heΓÇÖs not an ordinary old man.
 Humph! That punkΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a million years too soon for that kid to take me on.
 Not really.
 It seems you have a bit of talent.
 Then youΓÇÖll watch my training?
 Give and take!
 I'm not averse to listening to your favor
 as long as you listen to mine.
 So which is it?
 Listen upΓÇª
 Nice ripe fruit that looks like this, like this and this.
 IΓÇÖll watch your training if you bring me that.
 You really will, right?
 This Toad Mountain Sage doesnΓÇÖt lie.
 Okay, wait!
 Plans are plans. They don't necessarily have to happenΓÇª
 Hello there, you ladies!
 Oh myΓÇª YouΓÇÖre funny, old man.
 No-no, this is the solemn truth.
 Yeah, and then, what happened then?
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.
 You fool! WhoΓÇÖs a Pervy Sage?
 I brought the promised item.
 Nice ripe fruit..
 Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! ThatΓÇÖs not IT!
 Looks good!
 Don't hesitate. Help yourself.
 Thanks.
 No!
 WhereΓÇÖd the ladies go?!
 I got my fillΓÇª
 LadiesΓÇª
 No doubt about it. That person isΓÇª
 Good grief. IΓÇÖve wasted timeΓÇª
 Hold it! Where are you going?! What about my training?!
 I donΓÇÖt care! My precious research has been ruined thanks to you.
 Research, my butt! I canΓÇÖt be standing around here, either!
 IΓÇÖm going to train hard, become stronger than anybody,
 pass the Chunin exam,
 and then IΓÇÖll exceed the Hokage!
 Humph! I donΓÇÖt care about such things.
 Here all you do is get in my wayΓÇª
 Jeez, what a repugnant brat!
 Stacked girls like the ones from earlier
 are indispensable for my great writing enterprises!
 I seeΓÇª So I should bring some stacked girls, right?
 Okay.
 W-WowΓÇª!
 If you gaze at me like thatΓÇª I feel embarrassed.
 OhΓÇª!
 What aΓÇª
 What a cute girl.
 I like you!
 You pass!
 Idiot.
 YouΓÇÖre really my type of girl. WhatΓÇÖs that technique called?
 ItΓÇÖs called Sexy Jutsu.
 Oooh, what an idea. YouΓÇÖre a genius.
 I get the feeling all adults are really affected by this technique.
 Then youΓÇÖll watch my training?
 Sure! However, I have a condition.
 A conditionΓÇª? What is it?
 A-Always beΓÇªin that form when youΓÇÖre in front of me!
 Hey! Sure enough, youΓÇÖre just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!
 No! IΓÇÖm not just a pervert!
 As if you didnΓÇÖt know!
 IΓÇÖm a super pervert!
 Darn itΓÇª HeΓÇÖs gone defiantΓÇª
 Well, brushing off the stuff until now as a joke,
 IΓÇÖll watch your training.
 You mean it, right?
 A sage doesnΓÇÖt go back on his word.
 Okay, kid.
 Do that training that you were doing before one more time.
 Okay!
 Okay.
 Darn it.
 Totally worthless.
 Shut up!
 ItΓÇÖs pointless to wear clothes.
 Hey, build up your Chakra one more time.
 One more time?
 Just do it, quick.
 You!
 What?
 YouΓÇÖre pretty sexy when youΓÇÖre naked.
 Jeez. IΓÇÖm concentrating, so donΓÇÖt interfere.
 Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.
 YouΓÇÖre messing with my focus.
 I seeΓÇªSo this is The Seal Formula.
 Two Tetragram Seals making a Double Tetragram SealΓÇª
 Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?
 Nine-Tailed Chakra is leaking from between the Tetragram SealsΓÇª
 and is fixed so that it can return to this kidΓÇÖs Chakra.
 Fourth HokageΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs to protect this kid, huh?
 But after that, itΓÇÖs stopped with a Five-Pronged SealΓÇª
 Putting Odd-Numbered Seal over Even-Number SealsΓÇª
 This kidΓÇÖs Chakra and that of the Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled
 and are not stable.
 No wonder he is not able to build up Chakra very well.
 That ticklesΓÇªold man.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 Perhaps someone elseΓÇªdid itΓÇª
 The formula is rough.
 Well, itΓÇÖs probably Orochimaru.
 Kid, give me a hurrah.
 What?
 Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.
 Jeez, heΓÇÖs demanding.
 Five-Pronged SealΓÇªRelease!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 Well, I just pushed the pressure points for relaxing.
 Just try walking on the water once moreΓÇª
 Sheesh!
 What?
 I donΓÇÖt know why, but itΓÇÖs going well!
 Yahoo!
 I guess itΓÇÖs about time to teach him how to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.
 Okay, kid. Come on out.
 IΓÇÖll teach you an ace technique.
 What, what ace technique? A deadly technique?
 ThereΓÇÖs something you need to understand well
 before I teach you techniques.
 You probably havenΓÇÖt noticed, but you possess two types of Chakra.
 Huh? Two types?
 Until now, have you ever felt a special Chakra?
 Special? HmmΓÇª
 Come to think of itΓÇª
 Come to think of it, I get the feeling there were times whenΓÇª
 Chakra suddenly sprang up and an awesome power came out.
 ButΓÇªI donΓÇÖt really remember those moments.
 I see.
 But I do remember sensing that it was different
 from the Chakra I always build up.
 If I liken it to colors,
 while itΓÇÖs always blueΓÇª
 it felt like it was red or something.
 I see.
 Okay. ThatΓÇÖs it for todayΓÇÖs training.
 What?! Already?
 What happened to the ace technique?
 I can still train.
 With training, a watched pot never boils.
 As long as weΓÇÖre here, letΓÇÖs have a bathΓÇª
 Not just falling inΓÇª
 Warms me up.
 A drink after trainingΓÇÖs the best.
 Say, say, Pervy Sage.
 What kind of technique is that ace technique?
 YouΓÇÖll find out tomorrow.
 Miser!
 WeΓÇÖll turn into boiled frogs if we stay in here too long.
 Ebisu, sorry for snatching your student.
 ItΓÇÖs okay. More importantly, I was surprisedΓÇª
 The Hokage has had us searching all over for you
 and we could never determine your whereabouts.
 To think you were in this villageΓÇª
 The Hokage will be pleased.
 Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?
 Not yet.
 I see. ThatΓÇÖs for the best.
 Sure enough, something about Orochimaru?
 No, unfortunately not.
 What?
 I just stopped by looking for material for my novelΓÇª
 My nature is not to get myself involved in trouble.
 What are you saying?! You should know!
 What is necessary to stop Orochimaru, known as one of the Sannin,
 the legendary three Shinobi,
 is the power of another Sannin!
 Your power, Master Jiraiya!
 First, I need to sign this contract
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says ΓÇ£I LOVE YOUΓÇ¥
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!

 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too

 First, I need to sign this contract in blood
 and mark it with the fingerprints of one hand.
 Then I build up my Chakra.
 The Hand Signs are Dog-Boar-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
 Then I must place my contract hand on the place where I want to summon it!

 What were you gazing at?
 Too Late for Help
 You guys did good work. Komei has confessed.
 It seems he plotted the Cursed WarriorΓÇª
 to mislead the public and to take the feudal lord position.
 Is that what Komei said?
 Yes. It turned out to be such a trifle.
 The Cursed Warrior vanishing
 was a soldier disguising himself as the Warrior
 using a strong nitrohydrochloric acid to melt his own flesh.
 It's empty again.
 With this, the Cursed Warrior incident is resolved.
 Now the Land of Birds should return
 to the beautiful and quiet land it used to be.
 Just a minute!
 But the Cursed Warrior still isnΓÇÖtΓÇª!
 DonΓÇÖt bother.
 ButΓÇª!
 Now you are relieved of your duty.
 Have a safe journey back to your villageΓÇª
 Why?!
 You said the one we saw first
 and the one last night were different, right?
 Perhaps there were multiple people disguised as the Cursed Warrior,
 not just one alone.
 If there was a person inside disguised,
 then how do you explain the Warrior flying?!
 As long as our mission has been ordered complete,
 thereΓÇÖs no reason to continue the mission in this land now.
 Besides, Komei confessed to the crime, right?
 But, itΓÇÖs suspicious!
 I canΓÇÖt go along with it if I donΓÇÖt get the whole story!
 This land has its own circumstances.
 Getting too involved will cause trouble.
 Humph!
 Then IΓÇÖll just have to do it my way.
 Hold it.
 IΓÇÖm the leader of this team.
 So what?!
 You look into the movements of the Cursed Warrior once more.
 Tenten and I will reinvestigate this incident from a different angle.
 What? But the missionΓÇÖs overΓÇª
 You have a point with what you said.
 Everything is moving along too swimmingly.
 All right! Leave it to me.
 Huh?
 Where are you going, Naruto?
 IsnΓÇÖt it obvious? To investigate the Cursed Warrior!
 What?
 Oh, Chishima.
 Um, Naruto just nowΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs nothing, itΓÇÖs nothing.

 Good night.
 Good morning.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 ItΓÇÖs a kite painted black.
 A kite?
 Look up there!
 ThatΓÇÖs a totally huge kite, believe it.
 I wonder if there was a big kite-flying festival or something.
 ItΓÇÖs rather plain for a festival kiteΓÇª
 What?! What does that mean?
 Oh no!
 Hey! Where are you going?!
 IΓÇÖm back.
 I get itΓÇª If one were to fly that in the cover of a dark nightΓÇª
 A Cursed Warrior hanging onto the black kite
 would look like he was flyingΓÇª
 With this, the mystery of the flying warrior is solved, believe it!
 NextΓÇª
 Someone was here on that nightΓÇª
 What is it?
 The Cursed Warrior came out from here.
 It just looks like an old temple that isnΓÇÖt used much at all.
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 LetΓÇÖs go, Gamatatsu!
 But Big Brother Gamakichi, itΓÇÖs nice and cool here.
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?! ln such a hot and humid templeΓÇª
 Indeed, thatΓÇÖs a nice damp wind.
 See? IsnΓÇÖt it comfortable?
 Draft from down below hereΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 Wow! I wonder if a giant worm made this.
 Or a mole?
 All right, letΓÇÖs check it out.
 I wonder how we should greet a mole if we were to meet one.
 Like I care!
 So Naruto is still investigating the Cursed Warrior, huh?
 I should probably inform Lord Moso.
 There was some trouble caused,
 but we have at last found a safe refuge.
 After him!
 Big Brother, where are we?
 Huh?! This place isΓÇª
 This is the residence of the feudal lord, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Really? Residence of the feudal lord?
 No wonder itΓÇÖs an impressive building.
 It was connected to this place?

 Shh! Keep quiet! WeΓÇÖll be discovered.
 Big Brother Gamakichi!

 As for me, IΓÇÖm not anyone suspicious!
 I was asked by the Superintendent Moso and
 IΓÇÖm investigating the incidentΓÇª

 What shall we do with him?
 WhatΓÇª? Oh!
 Oh. Sagi, bro! Hey! We met at the lake, didnΓÇÖt we?
 Explain to them about me!
 I know no such person.
 What?!

 Hey, thatΓÇÖs harsh! Come on, Sagi!
 Hey! Wait a minute! Come on, hey!
 Come on. This is a misunderstanding!
 I was just going after the Cursed Warrior!
 Umm, everything will make sense if you just ask Mr. Moso.
 You okay?
 Yo!
 I canΓÇÖt be fighting the soldiers of my employerΓÇÖs land.
 Geez. You had to go and get caught in that trap!
 Well, itΓÇÖs cool. I can get out of a place like this right away

 Hey, untie this.
 Right. Just a second.

 Sagi?!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on here?
 YouΓÇÖre the other Cursed Warrior?
 But, why?
 They say people become disembodied spirits and avenge themselvesΓÇª
 But thatΓÇÖs a lie!
 This watch has been handed down from generation to generation
 in the feudal lord family.
 It was supposed to be passed from father to sonΓÇª
 But now along with that death, the watch has stopped ticking away.
 It must have been very sadΓÇª
 I am shamelessly living on only for the sake of revenge!
 I can go to hell if I can just complete my revenge!
 ThatΓÇÖs no good!
 There is no way you could understand
 how someone who has had everything taken away from them feels!
 Like I know about stuff like that!
 But I, at least, know that living for the sake of revenge is wrong!
 YouΓÇÖre a feudal lord, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Is revenge the job of a feudal lord?
 You know thatΓÇÖs not it.
 The true culprit Komei has been arrested.
 You should just leave the rest to Moso. Okay?
 It is no concern of yoursΓÇª
 I must not let you live
 now that you have learned everything!
 As the thief who snuck into the residence of the feudal lordΓÇª
 your fate is a death sentence!

 But thereΓÇÖs not nearly enough information about his body.
 I think itΓÇÖd be quite different  if we had something
 like the medical history and treatment data of his clan.
 What came out after looking into it
 was the bloody history of how the Kaguya Clan became just himΓÇª
 Fools who provoked the great land of the Village Hidden in the Mist into battle
 with just their clan and were annihilated.
 The Kaguya Clan was a foolish clan that liked battle.
 The battlefield was the only place where they could be at peace.
 But it was long ago when a simple-minded group
 that only enjoyed slaughter was acceptableΓÇª
 The times are different now.
 Doing something like fighting only with power
 against a governed organization like the MistΓÇª
 can only be called an act of fools rushing towards death.
 And then you saved only he who was the youngest
 and the most exceptional among the Kaguya ClanΓÇª
 That kid possessed the power that would be feared even by the fighting clan.
 So it seems he was kept in prison the whole time.
 It wouldΓÇÖve been a waste to let himΓÇªdie.
 Who wouldnΓÇÖt want that rare Kekkei Genkai?
 He possesses a strong and firm bone structure
 and a defensive power to repel all kinds of physical attacks.
 And if turned to offenseΓÇª
 the bones become a most powerful weapon.
 ItΓÇÖs because IΓÇÖve fought him once that I understand this.
 That sand shield is an absolute defense, no less.
 And that unusual formΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be okay. ThereΓÇÖs no way itΓÇÖll be broken!
 ItΓÇÖs hardΓÇª
 I gathered minerals with great hardness from the ground,
 applied pressure with Chakra and mixed them into the sand.
 YouΓÇª that unusual JutsuΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the Kekkei Genkai, right?
 The Kaguya ClanΓÇª
 The ability which now only I possess.
 The last one of the clan, eh?
 Then itΓÇÖll die out here today.
 Indeed, that might happen.
 Due to sickness, my body will not last so longΓÇª
 But, the clan will not die out.
 Besides IΓÇÖm not alone.
 This is the ΓÇ£EarthΓÇ¥ Curse MarkΓÇª
 With thisΓÇª
 I can become a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.
 LetΓÇÖs get everything, Kimimaro.
 And letΓÇÖs see the truth of this world together.
 Yes.
 YouΓÇÖre my ΓÇ£Vessel of Dreams.ΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 They are presents from me. I hope you like them.
 Would you ratherΓÇªdie or obey?
 ObeyΓÇª
 You will!
 Is this the best a team of four can do?
 IΓÇÖll ask just once moreΓÇª
 Which would you rather choose?
 Very wellΓÇª
 As of now, weΓÇÖre the Sound Ninja Five.
 Not alone, you saidΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 As an existence shouldering one part of Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs ambitionΓÇª
 I will remain inside Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs soulΓÇª
 for all eternity.
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs brainwashing, huhΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖre a pitiful guy.
 I used my big moves too much. I donΓÇÖt have much Chakra.
 This is the last of it.
 What an amount of ChakraΓÇª
 You are somethingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll sink and confine you 200 meters into the ground.
 By the pressure of the sand stuck to your body,
 youΓÇÖll soon be unable to move, not even a fingerΓÇª
 You did itΓÇª! This time for sure you did it.
 DanceΓÇª
 Bracken Dance!
 It is annoyingΓÇª
 It feels like a long time
 when waiting eagerly for something you want.
 KabutoΓÇª
 Stop talking like youΓÇÖre humoring a child!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 But you should know this the most, Lord Orochimaru.
 Nobody can beat Kimimaro,
 no matter what hindrance should appear.
 Thanks for saving meΓÇª
 Being able to do something like this; very impressive.
 All I did was ride the sand IΓÇÖm always controlling.
 You just have to know how you use it.
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry, Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 At lastΓÇª The destruction of  the Leaf will beginΓÇª
 Third HokageΓÇª IΓÇÖll teach you a thing or two.
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Kimimaro?
 NoΓÇª ItΓÇÖs nothing.
 Even the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand Village
 is no match against us.
 Of courseΓÇª
 Kimimaro, itΓÇÖs thanks to youΓÇª
 Kimimaro!
 Kimimaro, so you canΓÇÖt go on, huh?
 IΓÇÖm sorry, Lord Orochimaru.
 If I canΓÇÖt be of useΓÇª
 then thereΓÇÖs no significance to my living.
 How is your condition, Kimimaro?
 The ΓÇ£Destruction of the LeafΓÇ¥ resulted in an unfortunate near-miss.
 But the Sound Ninja Four have gone to pick up a new vesselΓÇª
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs new  ΓÇ£Vessel of Dreams.ΓÇ¥
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs brainwashing, huhΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖre a pitiful guyΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre wrongΓÇª Far from it!
 ThereΓÇÖs no significance to livingΓÇª
 ButΓÇªyou might be able to discover something interesting
 by continuing to liveΓÇª
 Like how you discovered that flowerΓÇª
 Like how I discovered you.
 This is the ΓÇ£EarthΓÇ¥ Curse Mark!
 With thisΓÇª I can become a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.
 LetΓÇÖs get everything, KimimaroΓÇª
 And letΓÇÖs see the truth of this world together.
 IΓÇÖm going to discover the truth of this world!
 With Lord Orochimaru!
 He was a persistent guy, but this is the end.
 He wonΓÇÖt ever come out again.
 R-RightΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt go onΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre getting offΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not brainwashing!
 That personΓÇª Lord Orochimaru understands me!
 What do you guys know?!
 HeΓÇÖs deadΓÇª
 Could it be? Has KimimaroΓÇª?
 The likes of Kimimaro makes no difference nowΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª I can hardly wait for him.
 HeΓÇÖll come here even by himselfΓÇª
 I would have been totally hammered.
 ThatΓÇÖs not the case.
 My sensei said it oftenΓÇª
 Luck is also a part of strength.
 That backseat driver?
 HeΓÇÖs not a backseat driver!
 ItΓÇÖs becauseΓÇª
 I wasnΓÇÖt good enough at that time!
 IΓÇÖm grateful for you saving me.
 But please donΓÇÖt talk like that about my sensei!
 You, tooΓÇª?
 When you feel that
 the honor of someone you revere has been hurt,
 you yourself are hurt badly and become enraged.
 The more important the person you revere is to you,
 the greater the feelingΓÇª
 The clan wonΓÇÖt die outΓÇª IΓÇÖm not alone.
 I will remain inside Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs soul for all eternity.
 That person, Lord Orochimaru, understands me!
 What do you guys know?!
 Fighting for the sake of someone important to youΓÇª
 He was also the same as Naruto UzumakiΓÇª
 ButΓÇªthe person who is important to oneself
 might not always be ΓÇ£virtuous.ΓÇ¥
 I wonderΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way someone evil can be thought of as an important person.
 No. Even if you know theyΓÇÖre ΓÇ£evilΓÇ¥ΓÇª
 People canΓÇÖt defeat solitudeΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak

 For the first time, I spoke to you

 For the first time, I was able to speak

 What do you mean ΓÇ£for achieving your goalΓÇ¥?!
 Orochimaru wants you only as a ΓÇ£vesselΓÇ¥!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way  I can let you go to him!
 This is no joke!
 If you insist on going, I have to take you back by force!

 and I donΓÇÖt know the extent of the pain youΓÇÖve feltΓÇª
 But itΓÇÖs a huge mistake for you to think that has determined your entire destiny!

 I wonΓÇÖt loseΓÇª

 NarutoΓÇª
 A brat who knows nothing shouldnΓÇÖt lecture arrogantly!
 People are born burdened with an inherent destiny that they cannot defy.
 NejiΓÇªliveΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre a man who is blessed with Hyuga ability
 more than anyone in the familyΓÇª
 I wanted youΓÇªto be born into the head familyΓÇª
 You canΓÇÖt possibly understand
 the destiny of being burdened with a mark that cannot be wiped off for life!
 YeahΓÇª
 I do understand it.
 SoΓÇªwhat of it?
 This brat!
 DonΓÇÖt be acting coolΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not just you whoΓÇÖs special!
 Hinata was alsoΓÇª suffering the same as you!
 Even though sheΓÇÖs the head family, not being acknowledged as suchΓÇª
 trying desperately to change herselfΓÇª
 She fought you while coughing up blood with that in mind!
 You too!
 The branch family that protects the head familyΓÇª
 Doing all that to Hinata just because itΓÇÖs an exam.
 In actuality, you were just as frantic
 in attempting to go against destiny, right?
 Vitality has returned to HinataΓÇÖs face!
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect of the Anbu Black OpsΓÇª
 She'll be okay.
 Now she needs bed rest.
 Your 64 Chakra Points are now shutΓÇª
 How are you, who canΓÇÖt use Chakra for awhile, planning to fight?
 At the end of the day,
 you and Miss Hinata have the same destiny!
 Shut up!
 With your Byakugan, labeling people and talking like you understand!
 ThenΓÇªshow me whether what youΓÇÖre saying is true or not.
 I will! IΓÇÖll defeat you no matter what and prove that to you!
 Dang itΓÇª Dang it!
 That being said, I donΓÇÖt feel Chakra at all.
 It feels like when I used up my Chakra in the training.
 You possess two kinds of ChakraΓÇª
 You must extract and utilize, at any time,
 the other huge Chakra that has rested inside you from the startΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs it. The Nine-Tailed Fox ChakraΓÇª IΓÇÖll use thatΓÇª
 Stinking foxΓÇª 					Help me out!
 This is as far as the talking goes.
 ProctorΓÇª IΓÇÖm going to fight with the intent to kill him!
 If youΓÇÖre going to stop me, please feel free.
 Jeez.
 DidnΓÇÖt I tell you it is pointless?
 This time, I really canΓÇÖt lose!
 IΓÇÖll win no matter what!
 ItΓÇÖs futileΓÇªI pressed the Chakra PointsΓÇª
 No matter whatΓÇª
 Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me kick that NejiΓÇÖs butt!
 A failure beats down a genius with effortΓÇª
 His opponent might be meΓÇª
 But even if thatΓÇÖs you, Naruto, no hard feelings.
 Why do you try to go against your destiny that much?
 Because I was calledΓÇª
 a failure!
 No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of thisΓÇª?
 H-HeΓÇª! 					What in the worldΓÇª?!
 W-What is heΓÇª?!
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª This Chakra!
 T-ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªimpossible!
 No way! His Chakra Points have been pressed!
 This ChakraΓÇª ltΓÇÖs the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubtΓÇª
 When did he master the Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇÖs ChakraΓÇª?!
 Here I go!
 ItΓÇÖs twistingΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs that?! ls that even Chakra?!
 Awesome power. More so than during the trainingΓÇª
 I feel it!
 Rotation!
 What?!
 His speedΓÇÖs gone up! What in the world is going on?!
 You!
 YouΓÇÖre confident in close combat, right?!
 YouΓÇÖre going to become the HokageΓÇª?
 I donΓÇÖtΓÇª think so.
 Only a very small percentage of Ninja are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokage are born with destiny.
 ItΓÇÖs not something you become by trying to become it.
 ItΓÇÖs determined by destiny.
 People must live within their different respective currents
 that canΓÇÖt be gone against.
 I donΓÇÖt know what the Hyuga destiny of hatred is!
 But if youΓÇÖre going to say itΓÇÖs futile, you donΓÇÖt have to do anything!
 This is bad! I must use the Rotation!
 After I become the HokageΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll change Hyuga!
 What ChakraΓÇª
 That kid showed some enormous strengthΓÇª
 The Hyuga kid is probablyΓÇª
 Say! Which oneΓÇÖs Naruto?!
 I donΓÇÖt know, either!
 NejiΓÇÖs Rotation is a technique where the body rotates,
 and dodges and repels the opponentΓÇÖs Chakra!
 It looks like there was more damage done to Naruto
 since he plunged right into the Rotation.
 ThereΓÇÖs no Genin that can beat NejiΓÇª
 But Naruto, youΓÇÖre incredibleΓÇª
 To think youΓÇÖd force him this farΓÇª
 Failure boyΓÇª Sorry, but this is the realityΓÇª
 Now this is really the enΓÇª
 My bodyΓÇª
 So he left a Shadow clone in the hole and spotted a chance to win, huhΓÇª
 Believing in victory, thinking about whatΓÇÖs next
 and acting even when getting knocked around, huhΓÇª
 The power of believing in oneself.
 That becomes the power to change destinyΓÇª
 He knows thisΓÇª And heΓÇÖs a natural to boot.
 In those conditions,
 you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu just like thatΓÇª
 The Ninjutsu that youΓÇÖre good at, huh?
 I was carelessΓÇª
 IΓÇÖveΓÇªfailed the graduation exam three timesΓÇª
 As luck would have it,
 the Ninjutsu tests that appeared on the graduation exam were alwaysΓÇª
 infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
 Clone Jutsu was the NinjutsuΓÇª I stunk at.
 DonΓÇÖt be whining about boring stuff like destiny and what not,
 and how it canΓÇÖt be changed!
 Because unlike meΓÇª youΓÇÖre not a failure.
 Winner of this match is Naruto Uzumaki.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Such intensity...
 If I take a breath or move my eyes I will be marked and killed ΓÇô
 that's what I'm feeling..
 If I'm stuck like this for an hour, I'll go mad.
 Facing a Jonin intent to killΓÇª
 This sensation is like having my life held in limbo...
 No way! I'd rather die to escape this feeling!
 Sasuke...
 Don't worry. I'll protect you all with my life.
 I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed.
 I don't know about that...
 It's over.
 Sensei! Behind you!!
 Die!!
 The Water Clone Jutsu...?
 It can't be.
 Don't move!
 The Oath of Pain
 It's over.
 W-Wow!!
 Did you say it's over?
 You don't understand, do you?
 You won't be able to beat me just by making like a monkeyΓÇª
 No chance.
 But, I must say you're good.
 My Water Clone Jutsu was being copied at that pointΓÇª
 I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed.
 By letting the clone talk as if it were you, you succeeded in distracting me.
 And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu to hide yourself to see what I was doingΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 I'm not a fool.
 That one was a fake too!
 Now!
 Makibishi spikesΓÇª!
 How foolish...!
 Sensei!
 Oh, I can't believe that Kakashi Sensei got ΓÇª
 kicked away like thatΓÇª.
 His Taijutsu skills are also extremely good.
 W-What's with this water...? lt's awfully heavy.
 Humph... Fool!
 It's the Water Prison Jutsu!
 Darn it.
 My temporary escape into the waterΓÇª
 was a huge mistake!
 You're caughtΓÇª
 It's a special prison that makes it impossible for you to escape!
 It makes things harder having you able to act.
 NowΓÇªKakashi.
 I'll have to settle things with you later.
 First, I will finish those guys off.
 Water Clone JutsuΓÇª
 Didn't expect this level of skillΓÇª
 You're acting big, wearing a headband like a NinjaΓÇª
 ButΓÇªa real Ninja is one
 who has hovered between life and death numerous times.
 In other words,
 only those who are worth being listed in my Bingo Book
 deserve to be called Ninja.
 Guys like you can't be called real Ninja.
 He's disappeared again!
 You're just a kid!
 Naruto!
 You three! Take Tazuna and run!
 You have no chance against this guy!
 As long as he has me trapped in this Water Prison,
 he won't be able to move from here.
 And he shouldn't be able to use the Water Clone Jutsu
 if he's far enough away from his real body.
 In any case, just run for now!
 Run away?
 You've got to be kidding me.
 That option was gone from the moment you got caught.
 Even if we ran,
 without you, sooner or later we'd be defeated by ZabuzaΓÇª
 and we'd all be destroyed.
 Even if we were to reform the Manji defense,
 it would be impossible to block his attacks.
 In the endΓÇª
 we'll have...
 no options left.
 In order for us to survive, our only option is to rescue you.
 We'll just have to do it!
 ThereΓÇª!
 Too easy.
 Sasuke!
 SasukeΓÇª
 T-This is the Jonin levelΓÇª A real NinjaΓÇª
 We've got to runΓÇª At this rateΓÇª
 SeriouslyΓÇª! SeriouslyΓÇª!
 We'll be killed!!
 I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!
 I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescuedΓÇª
 I'll never be afraid or be a coward.
 Are you hurtΓÇªscaredy cat?
 I won't lose to Sasuke.
 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?
 This?
 This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.
 Congratulations on your graduation.
 That's because you're all squirts
 who don't have the qualifications to become Ninjas.
 Missions are all risky assignments.
 You pass!
 I'm not that little prankster that you think I am!
 I'm going to surpass the Hokage!
 And so I'm going to get the entire Village
 to acknowledge my existence!
 That's rightΓÇª
 I am a Ninja now. And...
 I decided that I was not going to run anymore!
 That I wouldn't run awayΓÇª!
 Y-You fool! Stop it!
 Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!
 Humph! Fool...
 What are you thinkingΓÇª charging off on your own?!
 Even Sasuke is no match for himΓÇª
 No matter how hard we try, we Genin are no match for himΓÇª
 Huh...?!
 The headbandΓÇª.?!
 Hey! You, with no brows...
 Record in your Bingo BookΓÇª
 about the man who will one day become the Leaf Village's Hokage.

 W-What is this feelingΓÇª?

 Now...

 T-This isn't goodΓÇª

 This is a seed that I plantedΓÇª
 I can't say that I want my life to be spared.

 You guys really haven't learned anything, have you?
 W-What?!
 You're still playing at being Ninja?
 When I was your age,
 this hand was already stained red with blood!
 Zabuza, the Demon!
 OhhΓÇª? It seems that you've heard of me.
 A long time ago, in the Mist Village, often called the town of Blood Mist,
 Ninja candidates faced their biggest hurdle.
 So you also know about that graduation examΓÇª
 That graduation exam?
 What is it...?
 This graduation exam that you're talking about...
 The students killed each other.
 WhatΓÇª.?
 Classmates who had shared rice from the same pot
 formed pairs and tried to kill each other.
 It didn't end until one of them died.
 Partners who used to talk about each other's dreams and aspirationsΓÇª
 How cruelΓÇª
 Ten years ago,
 the Mist Village's graduation exam was forced to undergo drastic reform.
 That was because an evil demon had appeared on the scene the previous year.
 Reform?
 What about the reform?
 What had that evil demon done?
 With no scruples or hesitationΓÇª
 a young boy who didn't even have the qualifications for being a Ninja,
 annihilated over a hundred examinees.
 That sure wasΓÇªfunΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 Die!
 Darn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu, and there are quite a few of them.
 Here I go!
 It's impossible, after allΓÇª
 There is no way that you can defeat the guy!
 There is only one way left to defeat this guy!
 Sasuke!
 I see!
 So that's your plan, Naruto!
 That's pretty good for you!
 Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill of ShadowsΓÇª
 A Shuriken won't work on me.
 I see. This time it's aiming for my real bodyΓÇª
 But...
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow...!
 This is... The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 A second Shuriken in his blind spot!
 But...
 Still too na├»ve...
 He dodged it!!
 Here it is!
 Yes! The plan worked!!
 That Zabuza had no clue as to what I was thinking,
 and I fooled him!
 Ninja must be able to see through the obvious.
 Did you see that ΓÇô the Leaf-style fighting of Naruto Uzumaki?!

 DonΓÇÖt you agree, Iruka?
 Mizuki, please stop.
 PleaseΓÇª!
 TsubakiΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt care what happens to meΓÇª
 I just donΓÇÖt want you to commit any more crimes.
 Please!
 Return to the village.
 TsubakiΓÇª If you care that much about me,
 then you could at least be useful to me!
 TsubakiΓÇª!
 What?!
 YouΓÇÖre so slow.
 Iruka SenseiΓÇª!
 Damn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hasty as always, huhΓÇª
 You sure havenΓÇÖt made any progress, have you?
 He vanished!
 He didnΓÇÖt vanish. HeΓÇÖs just fast.
 That guyΓÇÖs been accelerating since earlier and moving into our blind spotsΓÇª
 In that caseΓÇª
 Everybody, better be very aware of your surroundings!
 I call it Uzumaki Whirpool Formation!
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Right!
 I seeΓÇª
 Even an idiot like him comes up with an idea once in a while.
 In that caseΓÇª
 I want to watch you experience even deeper despairΓÇª
 Despair thatΓÇÖs equal to that wisdom youΓÇÖve managed to muster!
 There he is!
 I see him!
 ItΓÇÖs not that you saw me.
 IΓÇÖm going out of my way to show myself to you.
 There!
 DamnΓÇª Even though I can see him, IΓÇÿm unable to land any blows.
 IΓÇÖm telling you, IΓÇÖm not foreseeing your movements.
 YouΓÇÖre just sluggish.
 OwwΓÇª
 Hey, serves you right.
 You demon fox.
 DonΓÇÖt be so delighted in such a big way.
 YouΓÇÖll now get a taste of the same agony I have endured.
 Starting now, right, Naruto?
 ThereΓÇÖs still much more to come!
 Stop that, Mizuki! DonΓÇÖt lay your hands on Naruto!
 Shut up, Iruka!
 Do you have any idea how much IΓÇÖve been waiting for this moment?
 IΓÇÖve been waiting for this day ever since then.
 For this time of revenge.
 I will use this power of mine
 and take my own good time to crush each of you, one at a time.
 Come on, stand up, Iruka. IΓÇÖll start by killing this guy.
 MizukiΓÇª!
 There you go. 					ThatΓÇÖs good!
 Come on!
 You are pathetic.
 ThereΓÇÖs a world of difference between us, isnΓÇÖt there?
 IΓÇÖve gotten my hands on this extreme body
 and it is your fate to die wretchedly.
 What do you mean,  ""extreme body""?
 When your power depends on potions,
 itΓÇÖs not true power!
 That sounds just like the half-baked guy you areΓÇª
 In that case, go ahead and try winningΓÇª
 Using that real power youΓÇÖre talking about!
 IΓÇÖm different from you. You're gonna live out your lifeΓÇª
 as some lowly teacher who never thinks  about getting ahead in life,
 who only gets used by the village in whatever way they see fit.
 How do you likeΓÇªthis powerΓÇª and the way I carry myself?!
 Even if you trained a hundred years,
 you'll never be able to earn it!
 IΓÇÖm not gonna stop here!
 IΓÇÖm still gonna get much much strongerΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll get Orochimaru to share his Hidden Jutsu with me.
 Do you really think that will happen?
 IΓÇÖm getting tired of you playing the martyr.
 I think itΓÇÖs about time to end this.
 IsnΓÇÖt this nostalgicΓÇª?
 This time, IΓÇÖll get you for sure.
 So prepare yourself.
 Naruto!
 You jerk! DonΓÇÖt you dare lay your hands on Iruka Sensei!
 This is really something!
 Every little thing is exactly the same as it was that other time.
 But IΓÇÖve changed.
 The reason for my defeat that timeΓÇª
 was that I let my guard down to the demon fox that you are.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs that?!
 I wonΓÇÖt let my guard down again.
 IΓÇÖll call upon all my strength to beat you down!
 Bring it on!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇªboth of youΓÇª
 Choji!
 DamnΓÇª If only I had a little more information about those guysΓÇª
 Elder BrotherΓÇª My body feels lighter.
 Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter, doesnΓÇÖt it?
 Okay, time for clobberingΓÇª
 Yeah! Clobbering!
 There they come.
 Damn it!
 Huh?
 What the hell is this?!
 M-My bodyΓÇª
 DoesnΓÇÖt moveΓÇª!
 Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis?
 Looks like I made it in time.
 Good work! Shikamaru, Ino, Choji!
 Leave the rest to me!
 The F-Fifth Hokage!
 No wayΓÇª Lady HokageΓÇªin person?!
 Lady Tsunade.
 IΓÇÖm sorry I found out about this so late.
 But I wouldnΓÇÖt have imagined
 that these guys were hanging out with MizukiΓÇª
 Fifth Hokage!
 We are savedΓÇª!
 UhΓÇªuhΓÇªElder BrotherΓÇª
 OhΓÇªOhΓÇª
 Well, we run into each other in unusual places, donΓÇÖt we,
 Fujin and Raijin?
 T-TsunadeΓÇª
 Let me ask what youΓÇÖre doing here.
 Powerful.
 More like, scary.
 Now then, is there something you want to say?
 IΓÇÖm sorry. IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Please forgive me. WeΓÇÖll never do it again!
 So you guys went with Mizuki because he told you that
 youΓÇÖd be able to eat something good at OrochimaruΓÇÖs place?
 ΓÇô IΓÇÖm, IΓÇÖm sorry. ΓÇô IΓÇÖm, IΓÇÖm sorry.
 No way we could stand up to guys on the same level as the Three Legendary Ninja.
 But I wonder what happened between them the pastΓÇª
 to make those two that scared.
 No thanks. I donΓÇÖt even want to imagine what it might be.
 Gimme a break. Falling for such an obvious bait!
 Mizuki has apparently gone into those mountains up ahead.
 Naruto and Iruka are probably with himΓÇª
 You guys come along after recuperating a little.
 HuhΓÇªwait a minute.
 What are we going to do with these two guys?
 Huh? You donΓÇÖt need to worry about thatΓÇª
 More importantly, I canΓÇÖt let them cause any more trouble.
 IΓÇÖve decided to make these guys go home on their own.
 Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assume you understand this already,
 but if youΓÇÖre even one minute late youΓÇÖre not getting any dinner.
 ΓÇô Yes, maΓÇÖam! 					ΓÇô Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 We canΓÇÖt be doing this, Raijin.
 LetΓÇÖs hurry back to the institution.
 Elder Brother, dinner, right?!
 Dinner!
 ΓÇô Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinnerΓÇª ΓÇô Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinnerΓÇª
 AmazingΓÇª what incredible speed.
 ItΓÇÖs very important for a person to eat, after all.
 ThatΓÇÖs just you.
 Damn! His power is even greater than earlier!
 But I canΓÇÖt let him take me down.
 This guy may have a lead to SasukeΓÇÖs whereabouts.
 Naruto!
 Iruka, are you all right?
 Yes...
 Did you notice?
 What?
 Although that jerkΓÇÖs power has increased multifold,
 the sharpness of his movements is diminishing.
 Huh?
 Did he transfer the Chakra he was using for speed, to power?
 I donΓÇÖt really know that, butΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs quite a heavy burden for Naruto to bear alone.
 But if that guyΓÇÖs speed has diminished,
 there might be a chance to win.
 All rightΓÇª You hang in there a little bit more, Naruto!
 How about this, you little brat?
 Do you like the power of this body that Lord Orochimaru gave me!
 IΓÇÖll tear you apart.
 Where the hell is heΓÇª?
 That OrochimaruΓÇª Where is he?
 Why would I tell a little brat like you that kind of thing?
 He wasnΓÇÖt in the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 The Village Hidden in the Sound? Did you go there?!
 The compound was already totally emptyΓÇª
 Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaru was there anymore.
 You really gave that one a lot of thought for a guy like you, huhΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know where you heard that about the Village Hidden in the SoundΓÇª
 but if youΓÇÖre trying to fluster me by talking rubbish like that,
 itΓÇÖs not gonna happen.
 Give up ΓÇÿcause youΓÇÖre going to the next world.
 Listen carefully. DonΓÇÖt you dare talk that kind of trash again!
 Naruto, this way.
 Iruka SenseiΓÇª
 Just try to catch me!
 You jerkΓÇªdonΓÇÖt even think IΓÇÖm gonna let you get away!
 Now! Jump up, Naruto!
 All right!!
 DamnΓÇªthis isΓÇª!
 Seal and Capture Perimeter!
 The Capture and Arrest Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto, that Jutsu isΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs the Fourth HokageΓÇÖs JutsuΓÇª RasenganΓÇª
 Are you all right, Iruka Sensei?
 Naruto, that was spectacular. Good work!
 Listen SenseiΓÇª
 It looks like this guy didnΓÇÖt know about the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 So I was thinking that heΓÇÖs no longerΓÇª with OrochimaruΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt talk trashΓÇª
 MizukiΓÇª
 You gotta be kiddingΓÇª
 This is an extreme body that I received from Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 I will go to the Village of Hidden Sound and become even moreΓÇª
 Iruka Sensei WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 ItΓÇÖs just as I thought, after all.
 Old Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade.
 His cells have started dying.
 You jerkΓÇª What have you done to me?!
 ItΓÇÖs not NarutoΓÇÖs fault.
 ItΓÇÖs caused from the substances you took!
 What? ThatΓÇÖs impossible!
 YouΓÇÖre getting a taste of your own medicine.
 That substance wasnΓÇÖt fully developed yet.
 The last casualty has been recovered.
 It appears that Shizune was injured, but thereΓÇÖs no threat to her life.
 I see. Thanks for your work.
 ThatΓÇÖs a reliefΓÇª Shizune is safe.
 Orochimaru probably developed that substance by chance
 while he was trying to develop a Forbidden Jutsu.
 What is certain is that
 that substance assimilates the DNA of animals
 and when it combines with the human body
 that serves to draw out its power in an explosive manner.
 But its effect is only short term.
 And in exchange, it puts a strain on the cells
 that far exceeds the limits of the human body.
 It certainly isnΓÇÖt something thatΓÇÖs one could actually use.
 But why did MizukiΓÇª?
 I donΓÇÖt know the details
 but it must be that Mizuki and Orochimaru
 had a point of contact in the pastΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 That tie has already been severed.
 Yes, unfortunately Orochimaru just used him as a plaything.
 Giving him an unusable drugΓÇª heΓÇÖs probably laughing his butt off.
 But Mizuki is one lucky guyΓÇª
 An ordinary Shinobi would have lost his life.
 Although he wonΓÇÖt be able to live his life as a Shinobi any more.
 Unfortunate, isnΓÇÖt it, Naruto?
 I kind of had that feeling anywayΓÇª
 I see.
 But I wonΓÇÖt give up!
 I will continue to do my best to search for clues to SasukeΓÇÖs whereabouts.
 TsubakiΓÇª
 Damn it, Iruka!
 DonΓÇÖt talk!
 Next time IΓÇÖll take you and that little squirt down without fail.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you could do that.
 While you were pursuing your futile dream,
 NarutoΓÇÖs been actively honing his skills.
 You canΓÇÖt possibly catch up with him any longer.
 Mizuki can never go back to being a Shinobi againΓÇª
 TsubakiΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm thinking of starting over again tooΓÇª
 But first I must atone for all the trouble I caused the villageΓÇª
 What a beautiful sunset.
 LetΓÇÖs return to the village.
 Dried and Canned Goods
 Fish Market
 I won'tΓÇª
 ever give up either!
 I did it!
 All right, since everybody worked so hard today,
 IΓÇÖm going to do something special and treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku.
 Yippee! YouΓÇÖre a real man, lruka Sensei!
 I want a block of barbecued pork!
 I want large portions of all three kinds of ramen noodles ΓÇô
 miso, soy sauce and butter!
 Hey, Iruka, before you do that,
 you and Naruto need to go to Leaf Village Hospital.
 HuhΓÇªI told you IΓÇÖm okay.
 DonΓÇÖt argue with me.
 Lady Tsunade!
 I cleared the first stage!
 SheΓÇÖs just started her ascetic trainingΓÇª
 Could she be an exceptional talent on par with ShizuneΓÇª?
 Hey, SakuraΓÇª!
 This time you saved meΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve really become stronger, havenΓÇÖt you, Naruto.
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 I can't stand it any longer!
 No matter how long I wait, there's no clue  about Sasuke's whereabouts!
 And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keeps telling me not to do a thing!
 At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke!
 Isn't there anything?
 Something, anything... a clue to finding Sasuke!

121,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 WhereΓÇÖs the other one?
 HeyΓÇª
 Who are you looking for?
 IΓÇÖll take care of the rest. Go wash your eyes in that river.
 This is my abilityΓÇª specializing in assassination, of course.
 You canΓÇÖt beat me by just having a good nose and nailsΓÇª
 You canΓÇÖt beat my ability!
 AkamaruΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 AkamaruΓÇª WeΓÇÖve always done things together.
 We were together whenever and wherever.
 However this one time, IΓÇÖm sunk.
 My cells can swim inside your body as I wish,
 and I can even create parts that are only you.
 In other words, a little bit of a fusion conditionΓÇª
 a sharing of the flesh is what itΓÇÖll be.
 A sharingΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 And a cruel way of killing that only I can accomplishΓÇª
 the gradual scraping off of just your cells!
 I seeΓÇª
 If thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇª!
 If I do thisΓÇª whatΓÇÖs gonna happen?
 Suicide?! ThatΓÇÖs ridiculous!
 Die with meΓÇª
 To Each His Own Battle
 What are you thinking?!
 ItΓÇÖs just as I thoughtΓÇª We are sharing one body, right?
 Damn it!
 Entering my opponentΓÇÖs body to avoid any attacksΓÇª
 that is my JutsuΓÇÖs greatest advantage.
 There hasnΓÇÖt been a single one before now
 whoΓÇÖs done this sort of thing.
 Are you in pain?
 All right then, letΓÇÖs get comfortable now.
 Yikes, you idiot! 					Stop it!
 ItΓÇÖs too late!
 ThereΓÇÖs not enough bloodΓÇª
 Damn!
 DamnΓÇª
 WhereΓÇÖd he go?
 So he left his little dog behind and fled.
 ItΓÇÖs the right decision, but heΓÇÖs more cold-hearted than me.
 What?!
 It couldnΓÇÖt be!
 What a reliefΓÇª HeΓÇÖs still breathing.
 What a relief!
 AkamaruΓÇª You really gave it your best.
 Because of you, I was able to hold up the enemy for a while.
 WeΓÇÖve caused injuries upon the enemy too.
 ItΓÇÖs enoughΓÇª YouΓÇÖve done enough.
 His name is Akamaru.
 Huh?
 MomΓÇª SisΓÇª
 From today, youΓÇÖll take care of himΓÇª Okay?
 I will?
 IΓÇÖm Kiba. Nice to meet you, Akamaru.
 You!
 WeΓÇÖve been together forever.
 Nice catch, Akamaru!
 All right, you did well!
 Here we go!
 Be more serious about it!
 Stop being such a baby!
 MomΓÇª
 Listen, KibaΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not just you.
 Akamaru and you,
 the two of you need to become strong together.
 With AkamaruΓÇª Together?
 AkamaruΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Way to go Akamaru! You did it!
 Mid-air Dynamic Marking!
 Next is mid-air triple somersault! Take your aim!
 Yahoo!
 Yahoo!
 WeΓÇÖll be together forever from now on tooΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll protect you from now on!
 That jerk!
 Setting up a trap on me!
 IΓÇÖll kill you!
 Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!
 Sakon!
 Sakon!
 Blah blah blah. YouΓÇÖre such a nuisance, Big Brother.
 Your yelling stings my eyesΓÇª
 Big Brother!
 IΓÇÖll kill himΓÇª is what IΓÇÖd like to do,
 but itΓÇÖs almost time for my sleep.
 Capture those bastards alive in my place.
 When I wake up, IΓÇÖll kill them.
 All right, Sakon? Capture them aliveΓÇª
 Yeah, I got itΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 The killing part, weΓÇÖll do it together.
 If I carelessly attack,
 he dodges and I end up attacking myself!
 Behold!
 Willow Dance!
 You!
 Bones?
 This is myΓÇªKekkei Genkai.
 WhatΓÇÖs with this guyΓÇª?
 Is he attacking with bones sticking out from all over his body?
 HeΓÇÖs grabbed his own bone!
 ItΓÇÖll be soonΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs turning the boneΓÇª into a sword!
 ItΓÇÖs futile. ItΓÇÖs not just ordinary bone.
 The highest density bone is hard as steel.
 So what?! IΓÇÖll break that bone!
 I possess Five Dances.
 YouΓÇÖd better not think you know my strength after just this much.
 What?!
 IΓÇÖll specially show youΓÇª
 the Camellia Dance next .
 Come!
 IΓÇÖll crush you!
 I did it!
 ItΓÇÖs a Substitution?!
 There!
 Damn!
 TheyΓÇÖre getting closer and closer.
 Damn!
 This isnΓÇÖt good, traces of blood!
 Damn, I did save Akamaru for the time being,
 but maybe I went too far.
 This smellΓÇª What does it mean?
 WhyΓÇª Why is it that even those guys are headed to a place like this?!
 I donΓÇÖt understand anymore.
 In any case, we need to leave this place quickly.
 I canΓÇÖtΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm starting to feel light-headed from the pain and loss of bloodΓÇª
 My body wonΓÇÖt move at all eitherΓÇª
 AkamaruΓÇª
 He left just his coatΓÇª
 Huh?
 So he fled by floating down the riverΓÇª
 Damn!
 Damn!
 DamnΓÇª
 This is it!
 So, IΓÇÖve cornered you, you stinking rat!
 Pretty impressiveΓÇª
 You timed it well to scatter the three to attack.
 You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
 Since itΓÇÖs a pretty complicated songΓÇª
 Well nowΓÇª
 Not only did you immediately understand
 that IΓÇÖm manipulating these guys with my flute,
 you understood how difficult this song is. YouΓÇÖre a pretty impressive punk.
 But you canΓÇÖt completely understand this song.
 You're so rightΓÇª since art is so foreign to me.
 But since she uses that flute to manipulate,
 it means that song must contain individually specific sound patterns
 to control each and every movement of those guys.
 IΓÇÖm pretty confident when it comes to just analyzing,
 but this time itΓÇÖs not looking good.
 The reason is that
 I donΓÇÖt understand musical notes whatsoever.
 ThereΓÇÖs no one thatΓÇÖs heard this song and lived.

 I feel so sad

 T-This guyΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 So we were too lateΓÇª
 Those guysΓÇª
 SaΓÇªSakuraΓÇª?
 You guysΓÇª
 T-ThisΓÇª
 He probably fought recklesslyΓÇª
 like that time!
 Sasuke!
 Kakashi Sensei said there was nothing to worry about with the bruise!
 So tell meΓÇªSakuraΓÇª
 Sakura!
 What do you want?!
 This guyΓÇª Who is he?!
 His outward appearance is different, butΓÇª
 heΓÇÖs that guy called Gaara.
 When I came into this world, I took the life of the woman some might call my mother.
 So that I could become the strongest ShinobiΓÇª
 my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
 and so I became possessed by a Sand Spirit.
 I was born a monster.
 So that's what he was sayingΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs the one who hurt SasukeΓÇª
 Hey young girl!
 I want you to know that IΓÇÖm not the fighting type!
 I can see that by looking at you!
 In any case, I need to get away from here
 and somehow take Sasuke to where Kakashi Sensei is!
 YouΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª!
 Well! Your limit is two shotsΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs about itΓÇª
 The third shot wonΓÇÖt be activatedΓÇª Remember this well.
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activateΓÇª
 not only will the Jutsu not properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zeroΓÇª
 and in the worst case, youΓÇÖll die!
 Even if you were to survive, absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your caseΓÇª
 Is it the Curse MarkΓÇª?
 If you let your hatred take over you,
 and rely on the power of the Curse MarkΓÇª
 your development will stop there.
 If that happens, you wonΓÇÖt be able to beat Itachi.
 In any case, I need to get control over this.
 Sasuke!
 I see youΓÇÖreΓÇª
 the one I failed to kill that time.
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myselfΓÇª
 And as long as there are others to killΓÇª
 I will never disappear.
 L-LetΓÇÖs run! Everyone!
 Die! Sasuke Uchiha!
 Sakura!
 Out of the way!
 Sakura!
 How could she stand in the way of that GaaraΓÇª?
 Darn! Darn! What the heck should we do?!
 Just with him, I donΓÇÖt want toΓÇª
 Now, let me feel it!
 WhyΓÇª?
 Gaara, Please calm down.
 ItΓÇÖs no use after allΓÇª
 The sand gets in the way.
 GaaraΓÇª
 Yashamaru!
 I may not look it,
 but Lord Kazekage charged me to look after your physical condition
 as a member of medical corps and to be with you.
 Please do not do such things in front of me.
 Although the sand will protect youΓÇª
 YashamaruΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Oh, this..? ItΓÇÖs just a scrape.
 A scrapeΓÇª
 Is it painful?
 A little bitΓÇª But itΓÇÖll heal in no time.
 Hey YashamaruΓÇª
 What is it?
 What is pain?
 IΓÇÖveΓÇªnever once had a wound soΓÇª
 I wondered what itΓÇÖs likeΓÇª
 WellΓÇª
 How can I explain it?
 ItΓÇÖs like itΓÇÖs distressing, or difficultΓÇª
 In other words, to be hit or cutΓÇª
 Maybe I should say itΓÇÖs a feeling of not being able to bear it,
 of not being able to stay normalΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt say it well,
 but I suppose it means a situation thatΓÇÖs not very good.
 YashamaruΓÇª
 Yes?
 So, do you dislike meΓÇªYashamaru?
 People live their lives while hurting others and while being hurt.
 But itΓÇÖs not so easy for people to dislike others.
 Thank you, Yashamaru.
 I think I sort of understand what pain is now.
 I seeΓÇª
 SoΓÇªmaybe IΓÇÖm injured too? The same as everyone?
 I'm alwaysΓÇªin pain.
 IΓÇÖm not bleeding, butΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve been having a lot of pain aroundΓÇªhere.
 Blood does flow from a wound on the body
 and the wound may appear painful.
 But as time passes, the pain naturally disappears.
 By using medicine, the healing is even faster.
 But whatΓÇÖs dangerous is a wound of the heart.
 Nothing has more trouble healing.
 A wound of the heart?
 A wound on the body and a wound of the heart are slightly different.
 Unlike a wound on the body, there is no ointment and sometimes,
 it doesnΓÇÖt heal for oneΓÇÖs entire life.
 But there is one thing that can cure a wound of the heart.
 However, this is a complicated medicine.
 It can only be given to you by another person.
 What? What must I do toΓÇª?
 The thing that can cure a wound of the heart.
 That isΓÇª
 love.
 Love?
 Yes.
 H-How can I get it? What do I need to do for this pain to beΓÇª?
 It has already been given to you, Gaara.
 Huh?
 Love isΓÇªa heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person, just like my older sister did.
 I believe that my older sister loved you, Gaara.
 Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a living  person used for the purpose of attacks.
 The sand which automatically tries to protect you is like the love of a mother.
 I believe that sand is filled with your motherΓÇÖs will.
 My sisterΓÇªprobably wanted to protect you even more after dyingΓÇª
 YashamaruΓÇª
 What is it?
 Thanks for what you did earlierΓÇª for stopping me.
 You are welcome.
 You are a precious person who is near me, Gaara!

 Twenty-two.

 ΓÇô LetΓÇÖs go! 					ΓÇô All right!
 Hey, YashamaruΓÇª I have a favor to ask!

 I want some ointment.
 Sorry about earlierΓÇª lt mustΓÇÖve hurt.

 Hurry up and come at meΓÇª
 Darn it!
 Everyone makes mistakes ltΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught
 LetΓÇÖs go carve the badges in our chest Yes, itΓÇÖs Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  ItΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about

 Down a difficult road filled with endless struggles
 Where do you think you are going following someone else's map?
 An insightful crow comes along to tear up the map
 Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

 IΓÇÖll go with Fukusuke.
 You go after Idate.
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Right!
 Hey, Idate! The ocean is that way!
 Where are you going! Come back!
 Hah! ThereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖm going back!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Right!
 What does that kid think heΓÇÖs doing?
 Looks like heΓÇÖs run away.
 IdateΓÇÖs been like that from long ago.
 You know him?
 Yes, kind ofΓÇª
 The Race is On! Trouble on the High Seas!
 I knew heΓÇÖd run away, that bastard Idate.
 Knowing him this long, you mustΓÇÖve figured this would happen.
 It was a mistake to let him run!
 You idiots! ldate isnΓÇÖt that kind of kid!
 ΓÇô Boss! 					ΓÇô BossΓÇª
 I believe in Idate.
 He must have a plan.
 Jirocho!
 Chief Retainer!
 How do you think youΓÇÖre going to settle this?
 You've turned this grand traditional festival into a mere farceΓÇª
 And worse, in the presence of the lord!
 Sir, the race has just begun. Please watch it until the end.
 Since you insist that much, you had better win.
 If you loseΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll ask for the dissolution of your family!
 Agreed! IΓÇÖm a man of my word.
 If Idate loses, you may do anything you wish.
 How like WasabiΓÇÖs Jirocho. Such confidence.
 Don't let us down.
 IΓÇÖm counting on you, Idate.
 BossΓÇª
 Give me your money!
 Just be still!
 A starving thief, huhΓÇª
 Sh-Shut up!
 A kid trying to act tough!
 With that little thing,
 you canΓÇÖt even peel an apple, can you?!
 Here!
 Take this.
 Edged tools arenΓÇÖt for hurting people.
 You donΓÇÖt have anywhere to go, do you?
 IΓÇÖm Jirocho of Wasabi of Degarashi Port.
 WasabiΓÇªJirocho?
 How about it? Why donΓÇÖt you come to my place?
 I-I just tried toΓÇª
 Anyone on the verge of starvation will make such mistakesΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt hold it against you.
 AhΓÇªthisΓÇª
 I gave it to you. 					Keep it.
 DonΓÇÖt ever do stupid things like stealingΓÇª
 M-Mister!
 Listen! Make me your henchman!
 No, I meanΓÇª could you please, Boss!
 WhatΓÇÖs your name?
 IdateΓÇª My name is Idate Morino.
 Shall we go then, Idate?
 Boss, just trust in me! I will win, no matter what!
 We can catch up to him in a bit!
 But itΓÇÖs too late now!
 He canΓÇÖt win if heΓÇÖs this far from the port!
 No, he may've planned to come this way from the very beginning.
 What?
 Huh?
 How lucky!
 Now, we can stop them here.
 At any rateΓÇª
 who wouldΓÇÖve thought theyΓÇÖd be escorting him.
 Double Lucky! Now I can pay them back.
 For what they did to us during the Chunin Exams.
 You two go ahead. IΓÇÖll keep them here.
 All right!
 Finally, weΓÇÖve caught up to you!
 Hey, wait!
 Geez! Why on earth did you come this way?!
 Shut up! ltΓÇÖs none of your business!
 What kinda attitude is that?!
 I said to shut up!
 Watch out!
 They arenΓÇÖt aware of it, are they?
 Of Genjutsu?
 Hey, I said wait up!
 IΓÇÖve already been here?
 Darn! Looks like IΓÇÖve been tricked by Genjutsu.
 Wha-?!
 If thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇª
 Release!
 There!
 H-Hey!
 No! DonΓÇÖt go that way!
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 IΓÇÖm out of it!
 Just be still!
 WeΓÇÖll get pulled up now!
 That was closeΓÇª
 A double Genjutsu.
 Pretty elaborate trick.
 You idiot! ItΓÇÖs your fault that weΓÇÖre going through all this!
 What did you say?!
 Hey, stop! Stop, I said!
 My Ninja tools!
 That was an unnecessary help!
 Did you say unnecessary?!
 Hey bastard, canΓÇÖt you even thank us for saving you?!
 You saved me because itΓÇÖs your duty!
 No need to thank you!
 What did you say?!
 Stop, Naruto. HeΓÇÖs right.
 But if you donΓÇÖt want to die, you should stay close to us.
 Hey, where are you going?!
 ArenΓÇÖt you going back to Port Degarashi?
 Stupid, IΓÇÖm heading north from here!
 North? Is it faster that way?
 YeahΓÇª
 Who knowsΓÇª I really donΓÇÖt trust this guy!
 This is why Ninja are no good.
 What?!
 At this time of year,
 a strong seasonal wind blows across this oceanΓÇª
 At the starting point, I watched the clouds and realized itΓÇª
 That the wind was coming.
 On top of that, at the port to the north,
 thereΓÇÖs an ocean current that flows straight to Nagi Island.
 This part is different from you guys. Right here!
 Looks like itΓÇÖs getting a bit rough.
 Hey, donΓÇÖt push it!
 Head more towards the south!
 But thatΓÇÖll take up quite some time.
 Once we get on the land, no one can run faster than I can.
 My victory is already set!
 All rightΓÇª
 I taste salt in the air.
 ItΓÇÖs the ocean!
 What is it that far out on the ocean?
 ItΓÇÖs the halfway point -- Nagi Island where Modoroki shrine is.
 I can get there within an hour. Wait for a sec.
 Hey, old man, IΓÇÖm here! lt's Idate from the Wasabi Family!
 Ah, IΓÇÖve been waiting for you.
 Looks like I was right.
 IΓÇÖll need you to lend me a boat.
 I see. I have it ready.
 Use that boat.
 ItΓÇÖs the fastest boat around here.
 I'm grateful to you!
 No problem. Boss Jirocho has done so much for me.
 So, donΓÇÖt lose to Wagarashi!
 IΓÇÖm fed up with how they handle things.
 Leave it to me!
 I may be down on my luck now,
 but I'm Idate, the number one henchman of the Wasabi Family!
 Rest easy and leave it all to me!
 Yeah, right.
 We should start seeing Nagi IslandΓÇÖs port soon.
 I hope we can get there before Fukusuke.
 Hey, NarutoΓÇª What do you think?
 Hm? What about?
 That IdateΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs definitely not an ordinary man.
 He can run extraordinarily fast.
 He could have received special trainingΓÇª
 What kind of training?
 Like, maybe heΓÇÖd been in a hidden village.
 A guy that stupid canΓÇÖt be a Ninja!
 WhoΓÇÖs talking here?! You're as stupid as he is!
 B-ButΓÇª
 I made it to the final round of the Chunin Exam!
 You were in the final round of the Chunin Exam?!
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖ s right!
 If I werenΓÇÖt interrupted in the middle of it,
 I could have won the tournament and become a Chunin!
 Hah!
 Then you must have had a darn easy proctor.
 Really, the level of the Chunin Exam has droppedΓÇª
 Oh!
 Idate, so you areΓÇª
 I remember now!
 Idate Morino.
 MorinoΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs right!
 WasnΓÇÖt the proctor of the first testΓÇª.?
 Be quiet, you rotten runts!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting.
 IΓÇÖm the proctor for the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 My name is Morino Ibiki.
 MorinoΓÇª IbikiΓÇª
 What did you say?
 Brother I-Ibiki is alive?!
 YesΓÇª
 Of course, heΓÇÖs alive!
 He gave me a weird problem on the 10th questionΓÇª
 Is that true? He really is alive?!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 An ambush!
 How is it?
 As you can see, itΓÇÖs right in front of us.
 Then, letΓÇÖs get started on our plan!
 Darn!
 Naruto and I will chase them away!
 Sakura, take care of Idate!
 IsnΓÇÖt it better to runΓÇª?
 Too late for that!
 IΓÇÖll cover you. Remove the ropes!
 Gotcha!
 Darn! I have to cut these!
 Darn it! I lost them all that time!
 Hey, lend me that thing!
 What?!
 Just hand it to me, hurry!
 Bastard, this is more important than my life.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖll let you use itΓÇª
 This is no time to be saying stuff like that!
 S-Stop you idiot!
 Hurry up, you loser!
 Heh, piece of cake!
 Sakura! They are just clones!
 Only the real one can attack you, so donΓÇÖt worry!
 Sharingan!
 Sakura, Naruto!
 The real ones are hiding among the clones! Be careful!
 Sasuke! Guide us!
 Idate, stay close to me!
 Hah! I donΓÇÖt want a NinjaΓÇÖs help!
 Are you still saying that in this situation?!
 Naruto! Behind you!
 Naruto!
 A clone?!
 Oh, shoot!
 ΓÇô Clone for clone! ΓÇô Clone for clone!
 Damn, they got away.
 Nice work! Naruto!
 That Shadow Clone kid is troublesome.
 The next plan, Kagari!
 WeΓÇÖll kill them all!
 Water Style! Black Rain Jutsu!
 Sasuke! TheyΓÇÖve changed into Water Clones!
 I know!
 Rain?
 No! This is oil!
 How annoying! IΓÇÖll get rid of them all at once!
 ThatΓÇÖs Tiger Seal!
 Sasuke, no!
 OopsΓÇª
 UnluckyΓÇª
 Humph, not really.
 Fire attack?!
 B-BrotherΓÇª
 Go! Having you stay will be a burden to me!
 B-BrotherΓÇª
 Idate?
 N-Nothing!
 Sasuke, what can we do?!
 If the fire is this strongΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll have to dive in to the ocean!
 From here, we can swim to the port of Nagi Island!
 Right! ThereΓÇÖs no other option left.
 Idate, can you swim?
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 Hurry! IΓÇÖll cover you, so go first!
 This smoke should help you escape unnoticed!
 Idate?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way!
 Wha--?
 You are tricking me into becoming a decoy!
 What are you talking about?!
 YouΓÇÖre trying to get the enemyΓÇÖs attention to me!
 ThatΓÇÖs nonsense!
 No! I donΓÇÖt trust Ninja!
 What are you doing? Go!
 Having you stay will be a burden to us!
 Go! Having you stay is a burden!
 Hurry up and go!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way we will use you as a decoy!
 N-NoΓÇª
 Cha!
 Idate! Duck down!
 Trust me Idate! I promise IΓÇÖll protect you!
 Watch out!
 SaΓÇª!
 Sakura!
 S-SakuraΓÇª
 Go on aheadΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll follow you right after!
 A-All rightΓÇª
 Well, shall we withdraw now?
 Withdraw?
 The most enjoyable part is still left undone.
 Darn, they are unexpectedly tenacious.
 Yeah. But we wonΓÇÖt let them get away.
 I-I should be okay hereΓÇª
 Long time no see, Idate.
 Y-You areΓÇª
 I have taught you so many times not to trust anyone.
 Such a fool, you areΓÇª
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Fool or whateverΓÇª lt doesn't matter now how you used to be.
 This race is not over yet!
 You'll never know unless you try 'til the very end!
 Boss Jirocho believes in you.
 If you have time to stall and act cool, why don't you show some guts?!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart

 Old Man Giichi!
 Please open up!
 Let's go to the bridge!
 If we all do it together,
 we can beat Gat├┤ and his men this time!
 InariΓÇª
 I made up my mind not to fight anymore.
 Even your fatherΓÇª
 The man we called a heroΓÇª
 He's not with us anymore.
 If we were to fight, many lives would be lost.
 I don't want lose something that's special to me anymore.
 No one wants to regret again.
 IΓÇª
 I don't want to regret again, either.
 That's why we must fight!
 A man should live his life without regrets.
 I love Mommy and Grampa.
 And you too, Old Man Giichi!
 I love all the people here!

 Nothing is accomplished if I just cry all the time!

 InariΓÇªhas grown into a fine man.
 Will you just let Inari go there by himself?
 Open up!
 Hey!
 I'm asking you to fight with me!
 Old man! Please listen to me!
 WhyΓÇª
 Why won't anyone open the door to me?
 You are strong!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Zabuza.
 You were too full of yourself.
 You're too ambitious for your own good.
 You assassinated the Mizukage, but failed to pull off a coup.
 You left the service with few men under you,
 and became a Rogue Ninja.
 Soon after, your name reached our Hidden Leaf Village.
 You needed to raise funds to strike back.
 And you needed to hide
 from the Tracking Unit's pursuit and retaliation.
 Isn't that about the reason why
 you hired yourself out to scum like Gat├┤?
 ZabuzaΓÇª
 Do you really believe I've managed to survive with just Sharingan?
 Here's something I didn't copy, a technique of my ownΓÇª
 to enlighten you!
 Lightning Blade!
 What theΓÇª?!
 His hand isΓÇª visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Tazuna, the man you are trying to assassinate,
 is the symbol of courage in this land!
 The bridge he is building is the hope of this land!
 And your ambitions will sacrifice countless lives.
 That isn't how a Shinobi is supposed to behave.
 Who cares?
 I have always fought for my own ideals.
 And that will never ever change!
 I'll say it again.
 Huh?
 Give up.
 Your future isΓÇªdeath!
 NarutoΓÇª
 I want you to kill me.
 Please, make it quick.
 What are you hesitating for?
 I just don't get it!
 The only reason you are allowed to live is because you stay strong?
 There must be something other than just fightingΓÇª
 There must be some other way
 for you to make the others accept you!
 Remember when we met at the forest? Do you know what I thought?
 That you and I are much alike.
 I'm sure you can relate to me.
 I apologize for dirtying your hands with my blood.
 Is that it?
 Is there really no other way?
 No.
 If onlyΓÇªwe had met under different circumstances,
 we could've been friends.
 PleaseΓÇªpromise you will grasp your dream.
 He tooΓÇª
 Sasuke also had dreams of his own!
 Thank youΓÇª You will become stronger.
 HmmΓÇª
 The super thick fog has finally begun to clear.
 There are two over there!
 They are facing off each other.
 Huh?
 I can't see wellΓÇª
 Which one is Kakashi SenseiΓÇª
 One moved!
 Huh?
 Forgive me, NarutoΓÇª
 I cannot die yet!
 Is this the endΓÇª?
 What was that?
 ZabuzaΓÇª
 Did you say my future was death?
 You're off the mark again, Kakashi!
 NoΓÇª
 You're not to go to the bridge alone!
 I went all over the town, but no one wants to come.
 I have no choice!
 ButΓÇª
 Wait! 					You're just a child!
 I may be a child, but I already know what it means to fight.
 Because I'm my father's son!
 My dearΓÇª
 Wait a moment, Inari!
 Where did he goΓÇª?
 I didn't notice, but the fog is starting to liftΓÇª
 Huh? Is he over there?
 Huh?!
 What the heck is going on here?!
 Isn't that the masked boy?
 I didn't expect him to jump in to save ZabuzaΓÇª
 The boyΓÇªis already dead.
 You did great, Haku.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 He intends to slash me along with the boy?!
 That was really a great find I made!
 Even in his final moment,
 he gave me such a perfect opportunity!
 Haku, bad news.
 I have to leave Land of Water as of tonight.
 However, I'll return to this land someday.
 I will rule over this land.
 To do that,
 what I need isn't consolation, encouragement or empty words.
 What I really need isΓÇª
 I already know.
 You have nothing to fear.
 I am your weapon, Zabuza.
 Keep me by you as a mere tool that heeds your every word.
 You're a good boy!
 Haku died and you were able to move, huh?
 I won't forgive you!
 Naruto!
 You just stay there and watch!
 This is...
 my battle!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Naruto! lt's good to see you!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Where's Sasuke?
 Naruto! 					Where is Sasuke?
 SakuraΓÇª
 Kakashi!
 You have no time to take your eyes off me!
 Why don't I go with you?
 That way, you won't be going against your Sensei's word.
 RightΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Huh?!
 He's cold.
 This isn't Genjutsu, is it?
 Don't mind me.
 This isn't the time to hold back your emotionsΓÇª
 I-I always got perfect scores at the Ninja AcademyΓÇª
 Huh?
 I memorized all the hundreds of Shinobi rules.
 All the tests were a breeze.
 Until one day, this question came upΓÇª
 State Rule ΓÖ¬ 25 of the Ways of the ShinobiΓÇª
 As always, I simply wrote down the answer without batting an eye.
 ""A Shinobi must never show his true feelings
 under any circumstances, no matter whatΓÇª
 The mission always comes first.
 A Ninja must have the strength of character never to shed any tearsΓÇª""
 Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?
 That is so unbearably painfulΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª? 					Why can't I keep up?
 Darn you!
 Why youΓÇª!
 You can't possibly defeat me the way you are now.
 What was that?
 You still don't knowΓÇª What true strength means!
 Let's see how things are goingΓÇª
 Goodbye, Demon!
 Both your arms have now been disabled.
 You can't even weave a sign.
 Huh?
 Oh! You really got it this time.
 You disappoint me, Zabuza.
 Huh?! You!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 Don't you have anything to say, Zabuza?!
 He was your comrade, right?!
 You were always, always together, weren't you?
 He really liked you, you know!
 You really don't feel anything?!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 ItΓÇÖs a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendship of the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the pride of the village and
 oneΓÇÖs own dream on the line.
 Heh, IΓÇÖm convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content of that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where IΓÇÖd like to explain the third exam.
 But actuallyΓÇª
 Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who was given the task of judge, to speak first.
 I leave it to youΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs something... IΓÇÖd like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 And that is a preliminary to the third exam,
 with participation in the main battle on the line.
 Preliminary?
 What do you meanΓÇªpreliminary?!
 Sensei, I donΓÇÖt understand the point of that preliminary.
 Why arenΓÇÖt we doing the next exam with the remaining test-takers?
 This time around,
 perhaps because the first and second exams were easy,
 there are a few too many people left, you see.
 In accordance with the rules of the Chunin Exams,
 a preliminary will be held in order to reduce the number advancing.
 N-No way!
 As Lord Hokage said before,
 many guests will be coming  to the third exam.
 So we canΓÇÖt have long pointless matches and our time is limited as well.
 Therefore, those of you not in top physical conditionΓÇª
 Hey, is he okayΓÇª?!
 The teacher doesnΓÇÖt look well himself?!
 Excuse me.
 Those of you who wish to drop out, please speak up now.
 The preliminary will begin immediately, soΓÇª
 Immediately, you sayΓÇª?!
 But we finally made it through  the second exam.
 This is a painΓÇª
 Huh? What about our meal?
 Narrowing the Field: Sudden Death Elimination!
 Okay!
 IΓÇÖm going to do my best, no matter what!
 I promised Kabuto, tooΓÇª
 And oh...
 I forgot to mention this, but it will be individual battles from now on.
 It is your decision, so feel free to raise your hands and drop out.
 WhoΓÇÖs going to quit?!
 Sasuke?!
 The waves of pain are coming faster...
 SasukeΓÇª I knew it.
 Sasuke, you should quit these preliminaries!
 Huh?!
 L-Look, you haven't been yourself
 ever since you got worked over by that Orochimaru guy!
 That bruise hurts even now, rightΓÇª?
 BruiseΓÇª?
 At this rateΓÇª!
 I gave him a parting gift.
 Sasuke will definitely seek meΓÇª in search of power.
 YouΓÇÖre the only one left.
 PleaseΓÇª
 Please, quit!
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªscared.
 SakuraΓÇª
 I knew it.
 What shall we do?
 We should remove him from the exams
 and isolate him with Anbu bodyguards on him.
 We should recommend that he retire immediately.
 HeΓÇÖs not the kind of type to  just obey like thatΓÇª?!
 After all, heΓÇÖs of the Uchiha clan.
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking nonsense for?!
 IΓÇÖll make him stop, by force if needed!
 The Curse Mark responds even when oneΓÇÖs just building up Chakra
 and attempts to forcibly extract his strength!
 ItΓÇÖs a prohibited Jutsu that eats into the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!
 ItΓÇÖs a wonder that kid is even enduring it.
 He should really already be dead!
 Lord Hokage!
 YouΓÇÖre in no condition to fight properly, SasukeΓÇª!
 Shut up.
 I understand!
 Be quiet!
 But youΓÇÖve been enduring the pain this whole time, right?!
 Please be quiet!
 No matter what you say, Sasuke...
 IΓÇÖm going to tell the teachers about the bruise!
 If I do that...
 WellΓÇª
 OhΓÇª?!
 WhatΓÇª?
 Excuse meΓÇªIΓÇÖll quit.
 K-KabutoΓÇª?
 Let's see...
 Kabuto Yakushi of the Leaf Village, correct?
 Then, you may step back.
 Okay.
 Kabuto!
 WhyΓÇÖre you quitting?!
 Tell me! Why?!
 This guyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry, NarutoΓÇª
 But my body is worn out.
 Actually before the first exam...
 when I wrangled with the guys from Sound Village,
 IΓÇÖve had no hearing at all in my left ear.
 To fight right awayΓÇª
 and to be told that my life would also be on the line, I canΓÇÖt go on.
 IΓÇÖve seen that face a few times.
 As I recall, I think he dropped out of the main battle before, as well.
 What in the world is he thinking?
 Anko.
 UhΓÇªyes.
 Kabuto Yakushi.
 According to the data, he has failed six straight times.
 What about his background?
 From his time at the Academy,
 he was a student who did not really stand out,
 and his grades were ordinary.
 He finally passed the graduation  exam on his third try.
 After that, as for the missions he carried out,
 two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.
 ItΓÇÖs not a battle record to write home about.
 HoweverΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs about before the Academy.
 Hmm?
 Do you remember the story...
 about the one boy brought back from the Kikyo Pass battle?
 I remember.
 As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivor at the battlefield
 was taken back by a Jonin from the medical unit.
 So heΓÇÖs that boyΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt take arbitrary actions.
 Have you forgotten OrochimaruΓÇÖs orders?
 I leave it to you guys.
 You in particular, Yoroi.
 There should be no problems here with your ability.
 This is where you can show your strength.
 Those of you who are irritated that IΓÇÖm ahead of you.
 So youΓÇÖre OrochimaruΓÇÖs favorite, huh?
 DonΓÇÖt get all high and mighty, kid.
 I understand, Yoroi sir.
 Oh.
 NarutoΓÇª SasukeΓÇª
 I wanted to play with you guys a little more.
 But if I do more than thisΓÇª
 The old me might get stirred up.
 I am a spy so far as it goes.
 I cannot expose myself, here.
 AlsoΓÇªif you are going to watch.
 My role of information collecting has served its purposeΓÇª
 Master Orochimaru.
 IΓÇÖll save the fun, for some other timeΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 And Naruto...
 You too.
 Now then, there are no others who will quit?
 I must tell the teachers, about SasukeΓÇÖs bruise!
 Huh?!
 Be quiet about this bruise.
 WhyΓÇÖre you acting tough like that?!
 I donΓÇÖt want to watch you suffer all the time anymore!
 For me you areΓÇª!
 This has nothing to do with you!
 ItΓÇÖs none of your business.
 I said it once beforeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm an avenger.
 This is not just a mere exam to me.
 The Chunin business has nothing to do with me.
 ΓÇ£Am I strong?ΓÇ¥ All I want is the answer to that.
 By fighting with those who are strong!
 AndΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm Gaara of the desert.
 Hey, you thereΓÇª ldentify yourself.
 I declare.
 You are absolutely no match for me.
 If I have the opportunity to fight you in the next exam,
 we wonΓÇÖt run or hide.
 And theyΓÇÖre... here!
 I will not allow even you to take my path away from me!
 SasukeΓÇª
 You!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing putting up a front, you idiot?!
 Here Sakura is this worried about you--!
 Naruto!
 I want to fight you, too.
 Huh?!
 What Orochimaru said is sitting on my mind.
 I will let Sasuke do the test...
 ΓÇô and see how things go. ΓÇô Wha--?!
 L-Lord HokageΓÇª!
 However, if the Curse Mark opens
 and the power gets even a little bit out of control,
 get in there and stop it.
 All right.
 But...!
 I understand.
 Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.
 The preliminaries to come will be one-on-one individual battles.
 In other words, actual battle format.
 There are now exactly twenty people, so we will conduct ten battles.
 The winners will be able to advance to the third exam.
 There are no rules at all.
 You will fight until someone dies,  collapsesΓÇªor admits defeat.
 And... please admit defeat right away  if you donΓÇÖt want to die.
 However, in case I judge that a match is overΓÇª
 err... I donΓÇÖt want to needlessly increase dead bodies,
 so I will intervene and stop the match or something to that effect.
 What holds the key to your destinies isΓÇª
 Open it.
 This.
 The names of two foes will be randomly selected and
 displayed on this electronic signboard.
 Now then, letΓÇÖs get right down to it
 and announce the two names for the first battle.
 Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
 To think itΓÇÖd be so soonΓÇª?!
 I couldnΓÇÖt ask for more.
 No wayΓÇª!
 Why Sasuke?!
 Now then, the two displayed on the signboard, come forward.
 For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.
 No objections, right?
 ΓÇô Right. 					ΓÇô No!
 All I can do now is watchΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 If you want to fight me, donΓÇÖt lose!
 SasukeΓÇª YouΓÇÖre acting strangeΓÇª
 Is it because of the Curse MarkΓÇª?
 Sasuke, do your best!
 I guess IΓÇÖll wait and seeΓÇª
 The pain wonΓÇÖt go away!
 It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
 Now then, we will begin the first battle.
 Everyone other than the two foes, please move to the upper area.
 Hey! Kakashi Sensei!
 Sasuke!
 Huh?
 DonΓÇÖt use the Sharingan.
 So you knew?
 If that Curse Mark on your neck gets out of control,
 it could endanger your life.
 I believe it.
 Well, the match will be called off at that time.
 IΓÇÖll be coming in to stop it, so good luck.
 Called off, you say?!
 It seems this Curse Mark thing  is responding to my Chakra.
 This is my final ChakraΓÇª
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!
 If I carelessly build up Chakra,
 it would extract my spirit energy,
 and bring out the Chakra inside my body to no end.
 In other words, in this match,
 I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu, not to mention the Sharingan!
 However... YoroiΓÇÖs ability is  the worst for you, Sasuke.
 Now thenΓÇª How will I goΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt act rashlyΓÇªSasuke.
 Now then, please begin.
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Yeah!
 Oh no!
 He did it!
 My strengthΓÇª?!
 W-What is this?
 My body strength has suddenlyΓÇª!
 Sasuke!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 YouΓÇªmy ChakraΓÇª
 You just noticed nowΓÇª?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Dang it! The pain won't go away!
 This darned Curse Mark is responding all the time!
 But I won't let this exam get called off!
 How will I do? How should I fight?
 Am I strong?
 All I want is the answer to that.
 I won't let this thing swallow me up in a place like this!

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, ΓÇ£See youΓÇªΓÇ¥
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if IΓÇÖm not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 This is as far as you go. Give Matsuri back.
 You think youΓÇÖve got me cornered now?
 DonΓÇÖt get the wrong idea. YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs been cornered!
 What?
 Byakugan!
 He has the final enemy cornered in a dead-end valley.
 The area around the valley is eerily calm.
 I donΓÇÖt see his comrades.
 Is ShikamaruΓÇÖs final move finished?
 No.
 We canΓÇÖt state definitively that theyΓÇÖve reached a deadlock.
 ItΓÇÖs because itΓÇÖs possible that the battles thus far were diversions.
 Just a little more, Lee.
 ItΓÇÖll be over once I connect two or three more muscles.
 SakuraΓÇÖs Medical Ninja technique is really becomingΓÇª
 And yet IΓÇª
 The treatment is over for now. How do you fight to get like this?
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 You saved me. Thank you, Sakura.
 YouΓÇÖre welcome.
 Oh, you canΓÇÖt, yet.
 As one of the Medical Team members, I prohibit you from fighting any further.
 No, please let me go.
 I canΓÇÖt just leave Gaara like thisΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre Team Return-the-Favor, after all.
 The Ultimate Weapon Reborn
 Gaara, you may very well be called the ultimate weapon,
 but have you not used up all of your sand in the fight earlier?
 This is my weapon.
 Indeed I have used up almost all of the sand with Chakra built up inside.
 ButΓÇª
 No matter what Jutsu you use, I must not lose in a one-on-one battle.
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing scary about a Shinobi with no weapon!
 Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!
 Fang Release: Dark Sword! Flying Double Edge Sword!
 YouΓÇÖll realize that the likes of a mere Ninja
 is no match for the Ninja tools created by us artisans.
 Fang Release: Dark Sword!
 It seems your own bodyΓÇÖs Chakra has run out.
 YouΓÇÖre carrying a monster inside you, right?
 Now, isnΓÇÖt it about time you used the power of Shukaku?
 You okay?
 Gaara Sensei isΓÇª
 Yeah, I know.
 Listen up. You hide in a safe place somewhere.
 Right.
 Although Gaara received SakuraΓÇÖs treatment, he's stillΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs as far as you go, ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!
 Damn it.
 Use the power of the Shukaku already.
 Hey!
 Hold it!
 Who are you?
 IΓÇÖll be your opponent from here on.
 YouΓÇÖre in the way, boy.
 Kujaku Hurricane!
 Damn it!
 Leaf Shinobi, you watch.
 The era of control by the Five Great Nations will end.
 No, it wonΓÇÖt be just that.
 If the ultimate Ninja tool created by the Artisan Village is completed,
 the existence of the Ninja will no longer be necessary.
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?!
 We are people from the Village of Artisans who for many years
 have equally shared exceptional Ninja tools
 with you in the Five Great Nations.
 However, each time relations worsened between fellow villages,
 the Village of Artisans would be attacked
 over fear of Ninja tools crossing over to the other village.
 You Ninja of the Five Great Nations have forgotten
 that you are kept alive by our power,
 and have returned the favor with vengeance time and again.
 Although we the people of the Village of Artisans have advanced skills,
 we have had to survive by currying favor from the Five Great Nations!
 However, that era will now end!
 First, I will take out the Leaf Village.
 Fang Release Dark Sword!
 How long can you run away for?
 IΓÇÖll stake you like a shrike!
 What?!
 You!
 Gaara Sensei!
 Gaara SenseiΓÇÖs sand protected the Leaf Ninja.
 That dome created with hard minerals in the ground mixed with sandΓÇª
 canΓÇÖt be smashed by such junk.
 IΓÇÖll protect him until the endΓÇª
 with my power!
 Gaara Sensei!
 DonΓÇÖt make me laugh!
 You, who are called the greatest creation of the Sand, a terrifying weapon,
 are going to protect someone else?
 And youΓÇÖre going to use what little Chakra you have left
 for the sake of a comrade?
 But that will be your death!
 Gaara Sensei!
 With this, all preparations are complete.
 Damn it.
 Oh!
 Gaara!
 We were contacted by someone from the Village of Artisans.
 It seems ones calling themselves the Four Celestials,
 bearing long-withstanding hostilities against the Five Great NationsΓÇª
 have completed forbidden research and are attempting to resurrect
 the ultimate weapon of folklore in the village.
 It seems the villagers got wind of the crisis
 and have evacuated to a different location.
 I see. So thatΓÇÖs why the village was completely empty.
 So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?
 The resurrection of Seimei, the founder of the Village of Artisans.
 Seimei?!
 Are you saying theyΓÇÖre trying to raise the dead?!
 I see. It makes sense that the mausoleum was violated.
 As for us, we must prevent the resurrection
 of the ultimate weapon at all costs.
 I understand. IΓÇÖll be off.
 Oh, hold on.
 Yes?
 IΓÇÖll be having one more person accompany you on this mission.
 What? Who would that be?
 What we wanted was the ShukakuΓÇÖs Chakra.
 What did you say?
 How weΓÇÖve waited for this time.
 Now Gaara, turn into the Shukaku now.
 And infuse me with that power.
 Gaara!
 IΓÇÖll save you now.
 Naruto!
 Matsuri, take this.
 My rope javelin.
 The optic nerves have connectedΓÇª
 OpenΓÇª
 third eye!
 Hey, you.
 What the heck do you intend to start?
 IΓÇÖll show you.
 The ultimate Ninja tool created by Lord Seimei,
 the founder of our Village of Artisans.
 Ultimate Ninja tool?
 Now is the time of its completion.
 Gaara!
 Oh, Lord Seimei.
 Please take possession of my flesh and complete your resurrection!
 Oh!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on? He vanished.
 The dead body came back to life!
 My name is Seimei. The founder of the Village of Artisans.
 A hundred years have passed and
 I have now been resurrected as the ultimate Ninja tool
 of the Village of Artisans!
 What in the world is happening here?!
 My long-awaited wish has at last come to fruition.
 With this, my Village of Artisans will reign over the Shinobi apex.
 I seeΓÇª
 So the monster from the Sand Village became the source of my power.
 Say what?
 Hoko said this.
 There is a monster lying within the body
 of the one called Gaara from the Sand Village.
 Once that person is in a cage,
 soon he will become a complete monster, the Shukaku.
 I will take away what you could consider infinite Chakra from the Shukaku.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do that!
 Damn it!
 Just wait, Gaara. IΓÇÖll get you out now.
 What a wasteΓÇª
 Vortex Wind.
 IΓÇÖm just getting started!
 What a fool!
 IΓÇÖll get you out now!
 Damn it, damn it!
 Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!
 Gaara, answer me! WhatΓÇÖs going on in there?!
 Gaara!
 Gaara!
 N-NarutoΓÇª
 Shikamaru!
 What?
 Where are Gaara and Naruto?
 Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.
 ThereΓÇÖs a cage behind an area surrounded by rocksΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a massive amount of Chakra being extracted from there.
 Gaara must be inside.
 Hey, Shikamaru!
 What?
 You know thereΓÇÖs a terrifying power lying dormant inside Gaara, right?
 Yeah, generally.
 Something terrible will happenΓÇª
 if Gaara has Chakra extracted like this and he loses himself!
 The Shukaku that had been kept under control will go out of control.
 Once it starts going berserk, there will be no way to stop Gaara.
 For real?
 I must not waste any more time.
 The entertainment ends here.
 Hot-hot-hot-hot.
 Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!
 IΓÇÖll get you out now!
 YouΓÇÖre a pest!
 Give it up already!
 IΓÇÖm just getting started!
 Solid Blanks!
 Oh, how I have waited for this time.
 Now, Shukaku! Give me power!
 I feel it. This is an amazing power!
 Cut out the futile resistance.
 The power of the Shukaku is already mine!
 I declare war on the Five Great Nations.
 The Shinobi in the Five Great Nations who made light of the Artisan Shinobi
 will fully realize the 100-year grudge of the Artisan Ninja.
 And they will inevitably become our sacrifices.
 Knock it off!
 What?!
 We wonΓÇÖt hand over our power to the likes of you.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you take away any more of GaaraΓÇÖs Chakra.
 You got that?!
 How can that person fight while getting that beaten up?
 Why do you go this far, kid?
 What is the monster of the Sand Village to you?
 GaaraΓÇª
 Gaara is an important comrade to me!
 He said he fights for those important to him.
 Fights for someone important.
 Very well. Then die!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, little girl?
 I finally figured out what Gaara Sensei taught me.
 Weapons took away the lives of my mother and father.
 But I can also protect those important to me with a weapon!
 Foolishness.
 Damn it!
 It has finally begun, huhΓÇª?
 Gaara SenseiΓÇª
 Gaara!
 Gaara.
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Hey, thatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 ΓÇô We were too late. ΓÇô Then, you meanΓÇª
 Yes. He is starting to transform to Shukaku.
 Damn! What should we do?
 This is bad. lf Gaara loses his conscious in that state,
 the true Shukaku will come out.
 When that happens he wonΓÇÖt know a foe from friend,
 he will just destroy everything.
 All we can do is just stand here and watch?!

 Since I have been entrusted
 with the great Village Hidden in the Leaves that you built,
 no matter what danger might strike, it is my duty to protect it.
 The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
 Yes, you really do.
 Is that you, Shizune? Enter!
 All of these reports regarding the villageΓÇÖs internal affairs accumulated
 because so many things were happening in the Leaf Village.
 I guess the only thing to do is start at the top.
 Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
 Did its name change?
 Yes, in the past it was called
 Prison Specializing in Capital Offenses Ninja.
 Fortunately, because there is a downward trend
 in felonies committed by Shinobi,
 along with the downsizing of the facility, the name was changed as well.
 Incarcerated are murderers,
 those who were involved in leaking classified secrets, and so on.
 They are all criminal NinjaΓÇª
 There havenΓÇÖt been any noticeable disruptions in the past few years
 and the facility has been relatively stable.
 ΓÇô Food! 					ΓÇô Food!
 ItΓÇÖs finally time to eat, isnΓÇÖt it, Elder Brother!
 Yeah! IΓÇÖm so excited!

 YouΓÇÖre hurt, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Go to the dispensary later and have that looked at.
 OkayΓÇª
 All right, next!
 H-Hey, Elder BrotherΓÇª
 Huh?
 Why is the little finger short and weak?
 ThatΓÇÖs easy, Raijin.
 If the little finger was thick and strong,
 then your thumb would have no leg to stand on.

 IΓÇÖll bring you something else later!
 Right now make do with that!
 ΓÇô Okay! 					ΓÇô Okay!
 Are you okay?
 Those guys are quiet when they have food.
 But if they get angry theyΓÇÖre out of control.
 YeahΓÇªThey annihilated all their comrades over food during a mission
 and the people around just barely managed to hold them down.
 Something smells good?!
 Yeah.
 This way!
 ΓÇô Food! Food! Food! ΓÇô Food! Food! Food!
 I just canΓÇÖt get to liking clerical work.
 ThereΓÇÖs still a whole lot more to do, Lady Tsunade.
 I wonder what this is?
 It looks like a formula for some kind of medicineΓÇª
 A formulaΓÇª
 Send an available Jonin here immediately!
 Yes, maΓÇÖam?
 Hurry!
 Y-Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 How about itΓÇª Does it taste good?
 I seeΓÇªI seeΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs still a whole lot more.
 Just as I thought,
 that good smell was coming from your place, Elder Brother!
 Uh yeahΓÇªΓÇÖCause Elder Brother always has delicious food!
 It was worth sneaking, wasnΓÇÖt it?
 ΓÇÖCause IΓÇÖd feel so sorry if you guys had to go hungry.
 Elder BrotherΓÇª
 ΓÇô A lizard! 					ΓÇô A lizard!
 I see, I seeΓÇªHappy?
 How about it, you guys?
 DonΓÇÖt you want to eat things that are even more delicious?
 W-Where are they at?!
 If we go to the place where an old friend of mine isΓÇª
 you can pig out on food thatΓÇÖs even more delicious than here.
 Is that the guy you told us about long time ago, Elder Brother?
 Yeah, Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 Gimme a breakΓÇª that guyΓÇÖs gotta be kidding!
 That Pervy SageΓÇª
 just leaving me and my training up in the air!
 Come on, donΓÇÖt say that, Naruto.
 Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
 Heh!
 ItΓÇÖs probably that Lady Tsunade decided
 that only Master Jiraiya could do the jobΓÇª
 It can't be helped.
 Damn! So it was Old Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs doing, after all, huh!
 Well, I guess all I can do is treat you to some ramen noodles like this.
 So cheer up.
 IΓÇÖm gonna go complain to Old Lady Tsunade!
 Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
 N-Naruto!
 DamnΓÇª another annoying situation.
 Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
 This is about a year ago,
 a Chunin Academy staff member used Naruto
 to sneak out the Scroll of Sealing.
 According to the report, it was a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
 The crime was solved, butΓÇª?
 Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
 The possibility has arisen that a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
 This is a clueΓÇª
 This is something that Mizuki was concealing
 when he was incarcerated in the Maximum Security Facility.
 At the time, nobody thought of it as anything more than a doodle.
 Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
 I donΓÇÖt know, howeverΓÇª
 The handwriting resembles the document confiscated from the facility
 where Orochimaru was conducting human experimentsΓÇª
 Which means thatΓÇª Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
 The possibility of that is not zero.
 ItΓÇÖs not like a Chunin alone could do anything with the Scroll of Sealing.
 It would only make sense if Orochimaru were pulling strings from behind.
 Asuma! Kurenai!
 Go immediately to the Maximum Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
 Orochimaru?!
 Be careful! SomethingΓÇÖs strange here!
 YeahΓÇª ItΓÇÖs too quiet.
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Oh, how touching. A welome party for usΓÇª
 YeahΓÇªweΓÇÖre giving you a big welcome. Right, Elder Brother?
 YeahΓÇª
 Asuma, donΓÇÖt tell me that those guys areΓÇª
 Uh huhΓÇªThe legendary idiot brothersΓÇª
 Fujin and Raijin!
 AsumaΓÇª
 Hey, you guys are whooping it up too much for a welcome party!
 Hey, calm downΓÇª the welcome partyΓÇÖs just started.
 His character has changed completelyΓÇª
 All you jerksΓÇª
 You willΓÇªbe our offering!
 Do it!
 Orochimaru!
 Asuma SenseiΓÇª Kurenai Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by

 What in the world happened?

 One more time
 Release the Genjutsu and wake up Naruto and Shikamaru.
 HeΓÇÖll be getting a mission after such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be carefulΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the first A-Ranked mission since the Land of the Waves.
 Ouch!
 You were able to release the Genjutsu too!
 Why were you pretending to be asleep?!
 Track down Sasuke, join up and then stop him!
 Then await next orders in a safe place.
 Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!
 IΓÇÖll tell you the reason en route!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 H-Hey!
 I get it! So thatΓÇÖs what happened!
 That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
 So, why am I pulled into this? This is such a drag!
 It canΓÇÖt be helped!
 ItΓÇÖs Kakashi SenseiΓÇÖs order.
 This way!
 How long will it be until we catch up?
 I donΓÇÖt know. He is moving at a pretty good speed.
 Dang it!
 A ShirkerΓÇÖs Call to Action: Layabout No More!
 Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.
 Huh? What is it?
 Did you find Sasuke?
 No!
 There are eight people in two squads behind usΓÇª
 NoΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs one moreΓÇª There are nine people following us.
 What?!
 CΓÇÖmon. Already?! Give me a break!
 It looks they havenΓÇÖt grasped our location, yet.
 We must lose them.
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs the point of stopping?!
 Shut up and follow me!
 Huh?
 WeΓÇÖre going back over our footprints.
 If we do that,
 itΓÇÖll look to them like our footprints suddenly disappeared.
 But, theyΓÇÖll notice even if we do this, right?
 ItΓÇÖll buy us some time. ThatΓÇÖs enough.
 ItΓÇÖll be a matter for great celebration if our pursuers get impatient,
 cloud their eyes of pursuit and lose sight of the trail.
 Hurry!
 ThereΓÇÖs no time.
 I-I know!
 This is not good.
 Though they're on alert for ambushes,
 theyΓÇÖre catching up with us slowly, but surely.
 Dang it!
 Probably theyΓÇÖre all Chunin or higher.
 WeΓÇÖll be wiped out if they catch up.
 Wiped outΓÇª
 Dang it! Since itΓÇÖs come to this, why donΓÇÖt we ambush them?!
 Ambush?
 Right.
 Indeed, an ambush would be to our advantage.
 Even if the opponent has twice the people than we do,
 if we just catch them off-guardΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs no good.
 Our opponents are former Leaf Shinobi OrochimaruΓÇÖs henchmen.
 In the worst case scenario, there might be Jonin.
 I thought itΓÇÖd work, but I guess not, huh.
 Hold it. Why?
 The level of opponent doesnΓÇÖt have much to do with an ambush.
 What do you mean?
 You guys donΓÇÖt get it.
 Listen. Indeed, an ambush is a very advantageous fundamental tactic.
 But two conditions are necessary.
 What are those necessary conditions?
 Number one.
 The ones on the run must act without making noise and find the enemy first.
 Number two.
 One must be able to catch the pursuers off guard,
 capture a point and position to be able to inflict certain damage,
 and conceal oneself quickly.
 AhΓÇª Huh?
 An ambush only becomes effective when these two conditions are ensured.
 Well, the first condition wonΓÇÖt be so difficult
 since we have the Ninja HoundΓÇÖs nose.
 And the second one also seems advantageous at a glance
 since we know the geography of our village.
 But Orochimaru has spent time in the Leaf before.
 That approach wonΓÇÖt work on his henchmen.
 So what do you really mean?
 Our pursuers must have been instructed in the terrain of this village
 and have gone through simulated practice for this fight.
 And on top of that,
 theyΓÇÖre probably all Ninja who have mastered the pursuit arts.
 So they know what cards we have, huh.
 Well, even so, the fact remains that an ambush is advantageous.
 But there are too many elements of uncertainty.
 In the first place, the enemy is a special unit organized for this operation.
 But we have a foolΓÇª
 a Kunoichi whoΓÇÖs nothing specialΓÇª
 and one dogΓÇª
 and, me with the number-one cold feet!
 A tactic is grasping the conditions that are there without fail
 and formulating an optimal plan.
 And so, thereΓÇÖs only one thing that we can do nowΓÇª
 One?
 A diversion in the guise of an ambush.
 One person will remain, pretend to ambush,
 and delay the pursuers.
 In other wordsΓÇª
 bait.
 Right. If we delay them,
 they wonΓÇÖt be able to grasp the positions of the remaining three.
 If we do that, weΓÇÖll be able to shake off our pursuers,
 but the one who has become the bait will probablyΓÇª
 die.
 So, whoΓÇÖs going to do it?
 We need the dog to follow Sasuke.
 That meansΓÇª
 FineΓÇª
 ΓÇô I'llΓÇª ΓÇô I guess it has to be me.
 Shikamaru?!
 W-Why you?!
 ItΓÇÖs better than being wiped out, right?
 Besides, among us,
 the only one who is equal to playing the bait
 and who has the possibility of survivingΓÇª
 is me.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Art originally intended as a delay tactic, soΓÇª
 Well, IΓÇÖll catch up later!
 Now get going!
 WeΓÇÖre counting on you, Shikamaru!
 Sakura!
 Yeah.
 Was Shikamaru ever this reliable of a character?
 Be carefulΓÇª
 Shikamaru.
 No matter how much you try to erase the signs of your presenceΓÇª
 youΓÇÖre in plain view.
 Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.
 What did you say?!
 I wonder if heΓÇÖs really delaying the enemy.
 Me with the number-one cold feet!
 DonΓÇÖt tell me, ShikamaruΓÇª
 Shikamaru will be okay!
 DonΓÇÖt tell me, he ran away.
 I said heΓÇÖll be okay!
 WhatΓÇÖll be okay?!
 He has a dirty mouth and always says stuff is a pain.
 But he wouldnΓÇÖt betray us!
 He hardly ever says heΓÇÖll do something himself,
 but he makes sure to do it if he says it!
 ThatΓÇÖs absolute.
 I want to believeΓÇª I want to believe, butΓÇª
 Pick up the pace!
 I somehow managed to get away completely.
 Their strides are irregular.
 Urgency is probably increasing their fatigue.
 Sorry about that.
 I was supposed to be the guy with the number one cold feet.
 It seems my character has changed just a bit this time.
 The fact that IΓÇÖm tired is true.
 Those footprints are wrong.
 By the way, this is what the dogΓÇÖs paw print really is.
 Oh, heΓÇÖs still a kid.
 To think weΓÇÖd all get caught like this.
 So this is the rumored Leaf VillageΓÇÖs Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?
 ThatΓÇÖs an old way of saying it!
 The times are passing!
 ItΓÇÖs called Shadow Possession Jutsu now, old man.
 Sure enough, that match wasnΓÇÖt good.
 I used too much Chakra. I canΓÇÖt hang on much longerΓÇª
 1, 2, 3, 4ΓÇª
 5, 6, 7ΓÇª8.
 Eight peopleΓÇª
 EightΓÇª No, thereΓÇÖs one moreΓÇª
 There are nine people following us.
 Sure enough, the ninth personΓÇÖs role is to protect against them getting ambushed.
 That person stays at a fixed distance,
 moves in the back and responds to an enemy attack.
 ButΓÇªthis will make clear where that personΓÇÖs hiding!
 There, huh?!
 Dang itΓÇª The Shadow wonΓÇÖt reach.
 I donΓÇÖt have the stamina to send it to Chakra.
 ItΓÇÖs futile. I see through your technique.
 Is this as far as it goes?
 It looks like youΓÇÖre at your limitΓÇª
 This Shadow Possession Jutsu is going to break very soon.
 Prepare yourself!
 I wanted toΓÇª become a Ninja any which way,
 save up money any which way,
 get married any which way to an ordinary woman
 whoΓÇÖs neither beautiful nor ugly
 and have two kids any which way.
 First will be a girl, and then a boyΓÇª
 I would retire from being a Ninja when my eldest daughter marries
 and my son becomes a full-fledged man.
 And then I take it easy in my life of retirement
 playing Japanese chess and Go the whole day.
 Then I die of old age before my wife.
 Such a life wouldΓÇÖve been nice.
 I was out of character, I tried too hard this time.
 I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.
 What I did was a dragΓÇª
 Hmm, the movements of our pursuers have stopped.
 Yes! The delaying was a success!
 Shikamaru, eh?
 IΓÇÖm sorry I doubted you, even a little.
 Okay!
 NowΓÇªyou wait, Sasuke.
 AndΓÇªShikamaruΓÇª
 Live, and catch up to us no matter what!
 As you say, it seems IΓÇÖm at my limit.
 Hey, come on out.
 While youΓÇÖre at it, cut off his head.
 I finally caught up.
 A-Asuma?! Why?
 Well done, Shikamaru.
 Sure enough, out of character.
 For the time being, you retire here.
 Hurry!
 What a pest.
 The pursuers have increased? Two? No, three?
 Kankuro! Pick up the pace!
 Okay.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away.
 DonΓÇÖt jump the gun, Sasuke.
 Sasuke.
 Now then, shall we begin?
 Everyone makes mistakes ltΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught
 LetΓÇÖs go carve the badges in our chest Yes, itΓÇÖs Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  ItΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 I donΓÇÖt know whatΓÇÖs going on!
 Why is Old Man Hokage fighting with Orochimaru?
 Why is Sasuke going after that guy with shadows around his eyes?
 I donΓÇÖt understand why we have to go after him,
 but thatΓÇÖs what we have to do right now!
 Wait up, Sasuke!

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)

 A coup at the Land of GreenΓÇª?
 Yes, it seems thereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 The retainers conspired with some men
 and began a rebellionΓÇª
 What happened to Naruto and the others?
 Speculating from their gathering point,
 they are around here.
 So theyΓÇÖve already crossed the borderΓÇª
 The large countries have agreed to make this
 a demilitarized zone.
 Considering Naruto and the otherΓÇÖs mission,
 they should be in a safe areaΓÇª
 Are you sure?
 What do you meanΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt you think the timing of this request
 strangely overlaps with the coup?
 Then youΓÇÖre saying that NarutoΓÇÖs mission is also related to this case?
 There is a possibilityΓÇª
 But thereΓÇÖs no time to deal with Naruto at the moment.
 We have to take back the Land of Green
 from the rebels as soon as possible.
 If we leave it like this,
 the flames of the war will eventually reach other countriesΓÇª
 TrueΓÇª
 Shizune, gather the free villagers
 and have them head to the Land of Green immediately!
 Yes, ma'am!
 YouΓÇÖve done it now!
 What a persistent bratΓÇª!
 You shouldn't be able to stand anymoreΓÇª
 Naruto!
 This isΓÇªnothing.
 What a surpriseΓÇª you got some guts.
 Then, take this too!
 Ninja Art Magnet! Electromagnetic Illusion.
 Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs useless! Your voice wouldnΓÇÖt reach him!
 The human brain functions by
 a faint electric current running through itΓÇª
 If you receive my magnetic force powder,
 itΓÇÖs going to alter your electric current and stop your thinkingΓÇª
 That chain also has a strong magnetic force.

 What?!

 How interesting!
 What wonderful Taijutsu, butΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll crush it with my power!
 I did itΓÇª?!
 Yeah rightΓÇª That level of Taijutsu will not work!
 ItΓÇÖs useless!
 This is badΓÇª!
 YouΓÇÖre not much of a challenge. IΓÇÖm disappointed!
 Now tell me! Where did you hide that girl?
 If you answer me, IΓÇÖll let you liveΓÇª That boy too!
 If you rescue him right now, he wouldnΓÇÖt die.
 RunΓÇªHinataΓÇª
 Now say it!
 You donΓÇÖt want to save that boy?
 Or do you think you could win against me?
 If I say itΓÇª Naruto would never forgive me.
 Then IΓÇÖll force you to talk!
 IΓÇÖll change the area behind you into a powerful magnet.
 I can change the position of the magnet according to your movement.
 So it's a waste to run away!
 That bratΓÇª
 She evaded the attack by throwing a paper bomb at that very instant.
 SheΓÇÖs pretty quick witted.
 ButΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt let you go!
 HinataΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª I promise that IΓÇÖll return to rescue youΓÇª!
 But, there is a huge difference in power between him and meΓÇª
 I could never win against him!
 HeΓÇÖs already caught up to meΓÇª What should I do?
 This isΓÇªiron sandΓÇª?
 I seeΓÇªhis Jutsu can change his body
 and the things he touches into magnet.
 The reason why he didnΓÇÖt attack back there
 was to brush off the iron sand from his bodyΓÇª
 If he doesnΓÇÖt, he would sink in his iron sand.
 His attack pattern consists of alternating between
 Ninja Art Magnet and Iron Sand Genjutsu ΓÇª
 He does this to turn his magnet powers on and off
 so his body wonΓÇÖt completely turn into a magnet.
 Then, there is one way to beat him!
 NowΓÇªplay time is almost over!
 Now, itΓÇÖs time you give up!
 I would never give up!
 Because that is my Ninja Way!
 What a wasteΓÇª
 How dare you do that to Naruto!
 I will definitely not forgive you!
 Once you say where that girl is,
 why donΓÇÖt you live with that brat in hell!
 Hey, donΓÇÖt be shy and come closer!
 Right now!
 IΓÇÖll risk everything in this single attack!
 An attack that didnΓÇÖt work before,
 will never work!
 IsΓÇªthat right?
 What?!
 We're both going to hell!
 Let go, you!
 You brat! How dare you play around with me!
 I changed my mind. IΓÇÖll finish you off now!
 What is this?!
 Just nowΓÇª I struck a Chakra Point
 that would make your Chakra flow go out of control.
 Now your body will just turn into a strong magnetΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª? ThatΓÇÖs why you brought me to this sandy area?!
 S-Stop!

 N-NarutoΓÇª
 I came to rescue you,
 but what is this treatment?
 SorryΓÇª
 Why did you escape by yourself?
 I canΓÇÖt count on you guysΓÇª
 I will try to survive no matter who's sacrificedΓÇª
 As long as I survive, the Land of Green can be revived.
 ThatΓÇÖs the most important thing, right?!
 I am a victim!
 If I declare that other countries will lend me their power.
 If I take back the country and
 I, the true successor, become the feudal lord,
 then people will definitely gather and
 the Land of Green will return to the way it was!
 I donΓÇÖt think so.
 YouΓÇÖre saying that the Land of Green wonΓÇÖt revive?
 IΓÇÖm not saying thatΓÇª
 But I just thought what if I lived in the Land of GreenΓÇª
 If I was a Ninja just like YurinojouΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt guard a feudal lord like you!
 Naruto!
 What do you know?! What do you know about me?!
 What do you know about my life as a hostage?!
 Under watch 24/7,
 not even allowed to have my own free time,
 I was lonely everyday.
 Because of that lifestyle,
 I became sick and was in bed for a long time.
 I was finally able to return home after being close to dyingΓÇª
 Naruto! If youΓÇÖre saying that IΓÇÖm wrong, then answer me!
 Were the things done to me
 in the name of protecting the Land of Green all wrong?!
 Then why did my father and mother send me away as a hostage?!
 Answer me! Naruto!
 I wonΓÇÖt count on you.
 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I will go too.
 I promised Hinata that I will definitely protect you, princess!
 With HinataΓÇª?
 She fought with the second Janin
 and got hurt badly....
 Hinata didΓÇª?
 You guys said that you didnΓÇÖt accept the mission of protecting me.
 Then, why do you concern yourselves with me?
 IΓÇª
 Not only me, but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before us is hurt or sadΓÇª That's all.
 Well, letΓÇÖs go!
 If we pass through the valley ahead of us,
 weΓÇÖll get to the town.
 If we do that, they probably won't chase us all the way there!
 Please be carefulΓÇª
 No one uses this deer path.
 This should shake themΓÇª
 I found you!
 ItΓÇÖs impossibleΓÇª to run away from me!
 Choji?!
 DonΓÇÖt make useless effortsΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll make you guys my hostages!
 You guys take them back to the castle!
 Yes!
 If you wander around me
 you might get caught in my Jutsu and die.
 ThatΓÇÖs itΓÇª WeΓÇÖre almost there!
 ThereΓÇÖs no time to waste! LetΓÇÖs go!
 Okay!
 Haruna!
 IΓÇÖm okay!
 Oh no!
 Wh-What is this?!
 I seeΓÇª You have good sense to dodge that attack!
 Who is it?! 					Where are you?!
 Here, over here!
 Too bad, but you guys wonΓÇÖt be able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are going to die here!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 Sasuke!
 NarutoΓÇÖs certainly different from you, Sasuke.
 HeΓÇÖs a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
 But heΓÇÖs not in the least a coward!
 Right? IsnΓÇÖt thatΓÇÖs right?!
 Sasuke!
 You foolish little brother.
 If you want to kill me, resent me,  hate me andΓÇª
 continue to live your ugly life.
 No...
 Flee.
 Flee and hang on to your life.
 No!
 No!
 The Sharingan Revived: Dragon-Flame Jutsu!
 Just what I expect of the Uchiha clanΓÇª
 His blood has begun to stir...
 I should take my time and confirm his true power.
 I have to live so I can kill my older brotherΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thought.
 But itΓÇÖs me who was being stupid.
 Naruto!
 Sakura!
 How can someone who canΓÇÖt put his life on the line at a place like this...
 beat that man?!
 I can see.
 I can see!
 I can see you!
 ItΓÇÖs pretty goodΓÇª
 You foretell my movements and your aim is sure.
 You can see my moves, canΓÇÖt you?
 The sun will set soonΓÇª
 I must find him quickly!
 It will become completely dark and my disadvantage will increase.
 But why in the world right nowΓÇª whatΓÇÖs his goal?
 Well, thatΓÇÖs fineΓÇª
 He came to this village. IΓÇÖll settle this here and now.
 I got you!
 A substitution!
 Sasuke!
 Humph! 					You are too easy.
 The Uchiha name is crying.
 ThatΓÇÖs okay.
 IΓÇÖll just take my time and play with you before IΓÇÖll kill you.
 Like a worm.
 This is Sharingan Windmill Triple Attack!
 Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.
 He did it!
 Sasuke!
 You did it!
 Are you okay?
 Hang on.
 Paralysis?
 I didnΓÇÖt expect that you could use Sharingan this much at your age.
 You are truly a member of the Uchiha clan.
 I do want you, after all.
 YouΓÇÖre definitely his brother.
 Your eyes hide more ability than that Itachi.
 Who in the world are you?
 My name is OrochimaruΓÇª
 If you think you want to meet me again, desperately run to the top of this test.
 ΓÇô The Scroll! ΓÇô Defeat the three...
 Sound Village Ninja under my control.
 You are not making sense at all!
 We donΓÇÖt want to see your face ever again, got it?!
 That wonΓÇÖt do.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 You, what did you do to Sasuke?
 I gave him a parting gift.
 Sasuke absolutely would come look for meΓÇª
 looking for power.
 I enjoyed seeing your various powers.
 Sasuke!
 Hold on, Sasuke.
 C'mon!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke, cΓÇÖmon!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke...
 Naruto!
 SasukeΓÇÖs... SasukeΓÇÖs...!
 Naruto!
 What?
 What should I do?
 I can feel it!
 HeΓÇÖs close by.
 ItΓÇÖs been a while...
 Anko.
 YouΓÇÖre level S class,
 an extremely dangerous person on the most wanted list.
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖll kill you here even if it costs my life.
 That is my duty as your former subordinate
 who learned it all from you. lsnΓÇÖt that right, Orochimaru?!
 No, you canΓÇÖt.
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you escape.
 I got you.
 Orochimaru,  IΓÇÖm gonna borrow your left hand.
 This hand signΓÇª
 RightΓÇª you and I are going to die here.
 Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice--
 You intend to commit suicide?
 Substitution.
 As you are a Special Jonin of the village,
 you canΓÇÖt be just using the forbidden Jutsu I taught you.
 I told you it wouldnΓÇÖt work.
 Why have you come now?
 ItΓÇÖs our reunion after so long, and youΓÇÖre awfully cold.
 DonΓÇÖt tell me that you came to assassinate Lord Hokage?
 No, noΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt have enough subordinates for that yetΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve heard of the excellence ones of this village and thought IΓÇÖd put dibs on it.
 A little while ago,
 I gave that same Curse Mark as a present.
 ThereΓÇÖs a kid that I want.
 Selfish as always.
 That kid will die.
 CertainlyΓÇª the odds are 1 in 10 that heΓÇÖll die,
 but he may survive just like you did.
 This kid, you really like him, huh?
 Are you jealous?.
 Hey...
 Are you still holding a grudge that I used you and threw you away?
 Unlike you, that kid will excel.
 For one thing he inherited the Uchiha ability.
 He has beautiful features and is a vessel who can become my heir.
 If that kid lived, it will make things interesting.
 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three people from my village are also under your care.
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happens to deprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 WeΓÇÖve secured food and water after spending half a day
 and now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned, this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into three and go scouting.
 However, whether we find other teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay.
 Scatter!
 His breathing is gradually getting regularΓÇª
 but he still has a terrible fever.
 I have to protect them both.
 I have to communicate this to Lord Hokage right away.
 Cripes! At a time like this!
 T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.
 So you are here, Anko.
 YouΓÇÖre pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.
 Well, donΓÇÖt say that.
 Are you okay, hey?
 Huh? T-This is...!
 The Curse Mark is appearingΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª?!
 Is it Orochimaru?
 What, really?
 Now that itΓÇÖs come to this, weΓÇÖll take you to Lord Hokage.
 No, take me to the tower.
 What are you saying?
 The moment Orochimaru comes to this village,
 a strict alert is issued.
 ItΓÇÖs more urgent than continuing the Exam.
 I knowΓÇª
 Anyway, IΓÇÖll tell the whole story later, so please call for Lord Hokage.
 I found you.
 As Orochimaru ordered, weΓÇÖll wait for daybreak to do it.
 Sasuke Uchiha is our target, not the other.
 If they come in the way,  itΓÇÖs okay to kill the other two, right?
 Of course.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village, Rock Lee, is here!
 Yeah, I did it! I did it, Guy Sensei!
 Now I can get Sakura's heart, right on the mark!
 You could say, in terms of numbers, the disadvantage is mine!
 But on the contrary, the conditions have been met.
 Guy Sensei, I will use that technique without hesitation.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Die.
 Darn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hmm... Shadow Clone Jutsu. And there are quite a few of them.
 Here I go!
 It's impossible, after all...
 There is no way that you can beat a guy!
 There is only one way left to defeat this guy.
 Sasuke!
 I see!
 So that's your plan, Naruto!
 That's pretty good for you!
 Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill of Shadows...
 A Shuriken won't work on me.
 I see.
 This time it's aiming for my real bodyΓÇª
 But...
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow!
 This is...
 The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 A second Shuriken in his blind spot!
 But...
 Still too na├»ve.
 He dodged it!
 Here it is!
 Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior!
 You little brat!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto...
 Your strategy was outstanding.
 You've grown upΓÇª Both of you.
 The purpose of the Shadow Clones was not to take down Zabuza,
 but to hide my transformation into Demon Wind Shuriken!
 I left one clone behind, then transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken.
 Then a clone threw the real me, who had transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken,
 towards Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 When Sasuke got me,
 he must have realized right away who I was.
 Then he took out his own Shuriken...
 And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 Demon Wind ShurikenΓÇª
 Windmill of Shadows!
 Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken, I aimed for Zabuza.
 Of course I didn't think  I would defeat Zabuza!
 But I thought I'd destroy the Water Prison.
 And as a bonus I defeated his water clone, tooΓÇª
 It was a huge success!
 That was a flukeΓÇª
 It was a fluke, huh!
 Still, they performed oustandingly in tandemΓÇª
 in this desperate situation.
 Despite the factΓÇª
 that those two always fight like cats and dogs.
 HmphΓÇª
 I got distracted and broke my Water Prison JutsuΓÇª
 That's not it!
 You didn't break the JutsuΓÇª
 They forced you to break it.
 I'll tell you now, the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.
 So what will you do?

 My movementsΓÇª!
 He's perfectlyΓÇª

 What?
 He's reading my mind?!
 Blast him! He's...
 giving me that barren, evil eyeΓÇª right?
 Hah! You're just copyingΓÇª You're a pale imitation.
 ΓÇô You won't be able to beat me! ΓÇô You won't be able to beat me!
 ΓÇô You! 					ΓÇô You!
 I'll shut that copycat monkey-mouth permamently!
 W-What's that!

 R-Ridiculous!
 Is that his Genjutsu (Illusion Jutsu)?
 Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!
 W-Wha--!
 No way!
 I was just about to set forth that Jutsu...
 I can't keep up withΓÇª
 his Jutsu!
 It's overΓÇª
 Why...?
 Are you able to see into the futureΓÇª?
 YeahΓÇª
 You're going to die!
 You were right. He died.
 He's definitely dead.
 I thank you.
 I have been waiting for the chance to kill Zabuza.
 By the looks of that mask...
 You're a Tracker Ninja from the Village Hidden in the Mist.
 Impressive. You're very knowledgeable.
 Tracker Ninja?
 You don't know what a Tracker Ninja is?
 We learned it at the Academy, didn't we?
 Tracker Ninja pursueΓÇª
 guys like Zabuza who turn against the village where they were born and raised.
 And when they break away from the village,
 Tracker Ninja go after these Rogue Ninja and assassinate themΓÇª.
 in order to avoid having the secrets of the village being leaked.
 That's common knowledge!
 You should study more!
 That's right.
 I'm a member of Hidden Mist Village's Tracking Unit
 whose mission is to hunt Rogue Ninja.
 From his height and voice, he's not all that different from NarutoΓÇª
 A Tracker NinjaΓÇª ?
 He's not just an ordinary kidΓÇª
 What are you?!
 Hey you!
 Don't worry, Naruto. He's not an enemy.
 That's not what I'm asking!
 IΓÇª!
 I mean...!
 That ZabuzaΓÇª That Zabuza was killed!
 That guy who was so strongΓÇª
 He was killed so easily... by a kid who's no different from me!
 We'reΓÇª
 We're pathetic!
 I can't accept that!
 Well!
 I understand your disbelief.
 ButΓÇª this, too, is reality.
 In this world, there are kids who are younger than youΓÇª
 and stronger than me.
 Your battle is over for now.
 I must get rid of this corpseΓÇª
 because it contains many secrets.
 Now then, please excuse me.
 He's disappeared!
 He's not here anymore.
 What was all this for?!
 What are we anyway?!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Darn it! Darn it! Darn it! DARN it!
 Things like this happen when you're a Ninja.
 If you're frustrated, apply it next time!
 Our mission hasn't ended yet.
 We must take Mr.Tazuna home.
 So sorry, everyone!
 You can rest at my house!
 Okay!
 Let's perk up and go!
 W-What!
 What happened!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 What'll we do?!
 Kakashi Sensei has collapsed!
 Gato's henchmen are probably gonna come and attack us again!
 Guess it means we've gotta fight by ourselves.
 Who knows if this training will make us stronger but,
 it's getting interesting!
 I'll definitely get stronger.
 Next time:  ""The Forest of Chakra.""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away

 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment

 No matter how many times you tryΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs the same!

 YouΓÇÖre not only sharpΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre also very determinedΓÇª
 In addition, IΓÇÖm nice, tooΓÇª

 But however I look at it,
 you donΓÇÖt have the feel of a helpless womanΓÇª

 DonΓÇÖt be getting full of yourself

 SheΓÇÖs still not completely bound.
 Damn itΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt lose!
 A little moreΓÇª
 What Chakra she has?!
 Even if I bind her at point-blank range,
 she still pushes backΓÇª
 But , IΓÇÖll get hammered for sure if I let go now.
 After all, I just have to put this to rest with this Jutsu.
 Hang in there, Akamaru!

 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?! Please go, quickly!

 You also promised Sakura with a ΓÇ£nice-guy pose,ΓÇ¥ right?!
 IΓÇÖll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!
 ItΓÇÖs a promise of a lifetime!

 I wonΓÇÖt let you!
 Die.
 Please donΓÇÖt ignore me!
 OhΓÇª
 Bushy BrowΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt have the time to be inattentive!
 Good response!
 HoweverΓÇª
 If Sasuke is inside that coffinΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖd be totally impossible to take them on with a Genin teamΓÇª
 We Jonin are in this plightΓÇª.
 We should organize a special team and send them out for backup.
 We canΓÇÖt do thatΓÇª
 Ever since OrochimaruΓÇÖs attack,
 the Leaf is currently losing strength as a great land.
 You understand that the Jonin and Chunin are being totally mobilized
 in order to take out possible domestic and international dangers.
 Even if the Sharingan were to fall into OrochimaruΓÇÖs handsΓÇª
 We should now prioritize avoiding war with other lands.
 ButΓÇª IΓÇÖm sure the Orochimaru situation isnΓÇÖt a problem that can be deferred forever.
 If he regains powerΓÇª HeΓÇÖll promptly attack againΓÇª
 I knowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not such a fool.
 I was sure to think about it and measures have already been taken.
 In here!
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, Guy? YouΓÇÖre on the brink of exhaustion.
 Did something happen on your mission?
 NoΓÇª I took care of the mission and ran back with all of my mightΓÇª
 More importantlyΓÇª
 Lee! What happened with LeeΓÇÖs surgery?!
 It was a success.
 He can start training starting tomorrow if itΓÇÖs just for Jutsu.
 Well, bed rest for a while would be best though.

 Sake?!
 UhΓÇªUh-ohΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, Guy?
 Actually, when Lee drinks even a little bit of alcoholΓÇª
 Things getΓÇªso messyΓÇª
 Get so messy?

 Please wait!
 IΓÇÖm sorry. ltΓÇÖs about time for my medicine!
 I have to be sure to drink it, soΓÇª
 Excuse me a moment.
 IΓÇÖve always disliked medicine.
 ItΓÇªhappened before when I took him to a restaurant
 to celebrate his acquisition of the ΓÇ£Hidden Lotus.ΓÇ¥
 Lee mistook my sake for waterΓÇª
 As soon as he drank just a small cupΓÇª
 of the sake, things got uglyΓÇª
 Got uglyΓÇª?

 had gotten all messed upΓÇª

 Kakashi Sensei?
 NarutoΓÇª That thing you just did wasΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you guys doing up on top of the hospital?

 That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.
 ItΓÇÖs the Rasengan.
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 How can Naruto use that JutsuΓÇª?
 Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?

 Sasuke.

 NarutoΓÇª
 How far will you goΓÇª?
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª
 Whatever happened to teamwork?
 Was it youΓÇª who taught him that technique?
 I think Naruto is still too young to be handling that Jutsu.
 He couldΓÇÖve killed Sasuke had something gone wrongΓÇª
 Even if itΓÇÖs a means of resisting the Akatsuki,
 to think you would teach Naruto that JutsuΓÇª
 Right back at youΓÇª
 That Chidori was also considerably hairy.
 But I didnΓÇÖt think he was the kind of kid
 whoΓÇÖd fire that Jutsu at his comrade.
 Or is it that thereΓÇÖs something quite complicated between him and that kid?
 Well, all sorts.
 All sorts?
 Quite simply, itΓÇÖs a relationship
 like the one between you and Orochimaru in the past.
 I see.
 To him, Sasuke is a comrade and a rival at the same timeΓÇª
 Well, someone he considers an equal.
 Most likely, he couldnΓÇÖt take SasukeΓÇÖs cheap provocation.
 HeΓÇÖs been chasing himΓÇª
 Chasing him since the Academy days.

 Scaredy-Cat?
 Sasuke!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose to you!
 For him, itΓÇÖs neither you nor me nowΓÇª
 More than anyoneΓÇª
 he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.
 On the other side of the coinΓÇª
 Sasuke feels the speed of NarutoΓÇÖs growth at close range and feels inferior.
 To the extent that he thinks he himself isnΓÇÖt growing at all.
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto has gotten strongΓÇª
 And SasukeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going to kill a certain man, no matter what.
 Revenge, huhΓÇª?
 I wonder if Itachi is frustrating that kid.
 So Sasuke doesnΓÇÖt want to acknowledge Naruto.
 If he acknowledges him,
 he just might deny himself up to this pointΓÇª
 Rivalry is a difficult thing.
 ItΓÇÖs not a very good trendΓÇª
 Maybe IΓÇÖll do some scolding.
 Then I leave Naruto to you.
 Well, I have a mission. And thereΓÇÖs the Chidori thing, tooΓÇª
 Sakura.
 ItΓÇÖs okay. Things can go back to the way they were in the old days again.
 Cheer up.
 See ya.
 Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Sakura.
 DonΓÇÖt interfere with us!
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak?
 It's because you donΓÇÖt have enoughΓÇª
 ΓÇªhate.
 WhatΓÇÖve I been doingΓÇª
 up until now?
 He got a nice look in those eyes.
 Shall we go soon?
 What do you think youΓÇÖre doing?
 If I donΓÇÖt do this, youΓÇÖll run away, right?
 YouΓÇÖre not the type to listen quietly to lectures.
 As I recall, thatΓÇÖs Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 SasukeΓÇª Forget about something like revenge.
 What?
 Well, in this business IΓÇÖve seen a stink of guys like you.
 But the final days of those who speak of revenge are never good.
 TheyΓÇÖre tragic.
 YouΓÇÖll only hurt yourself and agonize more than now.
 Even if you succeed in revenge, all that will remain is emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?
 DonΓÇÖt talk to me as if you know!
 Well, calm downΓÇª
 If you like,
 shall I go and kill the person most important to you?
 YouΓÇÖll be able to realize just how far off you are
 on what you just said.
 Well, I wouldnΓÇÖt mind if youΓÇÖd do that.
 Unfortunately, I donΓÇÖt even have one person like that.
 EveryoneΓÇÖs already been killed.
 IΓÇÖve lived longer than you haveΓÇª
 The times were not good.
 I know all too well the agony of losing something.
 Well, both you and I arenΓÇÖt the lucky onesΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs for darned sure.
 But weΓÇÖre not the worst, either.
 You and I,
 we both have already found dear comrades, havenΓÇÖt we?
 ItΓÇÖs because I have lost that I understand.
 The Chidori is a powerΓÇª
 I gave to you because you now have something important.
 You should know that itΓÇÖs not a power
 to be used on your comrade or to use for revenge,
 and IΓÇÖm sure you know what it should be used for.
 Think hard about whether or not what IΓÇÖm saying is wrong.
 ItΓÇÖll be tricky with a Shinobi of that level hanging around.
 So letΓÇÖs wait a bit.
 Maybe jerks like youΓÇÖd be no good. But I could do it.
 I wonder. ΓÇ£TwoΓÇ¥ should be ample to rip him apart.
 DonΓÇÖt be butting in all the time, you clod.
 Tayuya, women shouldnΓÇÖt use words like that tooΓÇª
 Shut up, fatso.
 ΓÇô More, please! ΓÇô More, please!
 Wanna head back?
 Sure!
 We both made it to the top of the tree.
 Sakura.
 I have a something to talk to you about.
 IΓÇÖll go out on a date with you, so come along.
 Damn itΓÇª
 Damn it!
 The Curse Mark left by Orochimaru during the Chunin ExamΓÇª
 Kakashi Sensei said it was okay now, butΓÇª
 Master Orochimaru.
 You didnΓÇÖt need to send out all four members, did you?
 It seems those kids are all interested in Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.
 To see what extent his power isΓÇª
 A contest of strength or whatever,
 at this point Sasuke would be no match for them.
 That is precisely whyΓÇªhe will come to me in search of power.
 WhoΓÇÖre you guys?
 IΓÇÖm Kidomaru, the East Gate of the Sound Ninja Four.
 IΓÇÖm Sakon, the West Gate of the same.
 IΓÇÖm Jirobo, the South Gate of the same.
 IΓÇÖm Tayuya, the North Gate of the same.
 IΓÇÖm in a bad mood nowΓÇª
 If you wanna continue to fight her,
 I wonΓÇÖt go easy on you!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 A date, a date!
 What do you want to eat, Sakura?
 Anything's fine.
 At any rate, Kakashi Sensei's over the top.
 I just wanted to fight Sasuke a little.
 But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it, right about nowΓÇª
 Of course, which of us was stronger would be settled, believe it.
 Listen, NarutoΓÇª
 Next time:  ""An Invitation from the Sound""
 I feel uneasyΓÇª

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Hurry!
 RightΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre close!
 There are two enemies leftΓÇª
 There are three of usΓÇª ltΓÇÖs three against two.
 We might be able to do it with one more contact if we do it well.
 All right! All right! LetΓÇÖs do it!
 No! ItΓÇÖs four against two!
 Okay, okay! IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Counting Akamaru, itΓÇÖs four against two!
 LetΓÇÖs finish it quickly with our new technique next!
 Say, say. If necessary, IΓÇÖll do an awesome Shadow Clone,
 so itΓÇÖll be okay!
 ThatΓÇÖs reassuringΓÇª
 But my strategy comes first. Got it?
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 For that purpose,
 we have to catch up before the sun sets at any cost.
 I know. Full throttle!
 The sunΓÇÖs starting to setΓÇª
 Neither Jirobo nor Kidomaru have come.
 It seems theyΓÇÖre having a hard time.
 It doesnΓÇÖt matterΓÇª More important is Lord Orochimaru.
 WeΓÇÖve only completed one-third of the journey in half a dayΓÇª
 They all have Curse Marks, huhΓÇª
 No questions asked, huh?
 This is gonna be different than that time before
 with your surprise attackΓÇª
 Too much interferenceΓÇª
 Yeah, this is badΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt know whether weΓÇÖll make it in time at this rate!
 Damn! We still canΓÇÖt catch upΓÇª
 No, this is good enough.
 WeΓÇÖll maintain this distance and continue the pursuitΓÇª
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I mean, weΓÇÖre delaying the attack until dawn breaks.
 Get real! We canΓÇÖt afford such leisure !
 ThatΓÇÖs right! Besides, if weΓÇÖre going to attack anyway,
 isnΓÇÖt it more advantageous to use the darkness and attack?!
 For us, the darkness works to our advantage
 only the moment we launch the attack.
 ItΓÇÖd be close to impossible to grab Sasuke,
 get away from them and escape to a safe location
 in just that one moment.
 If we couldnΓÇÖt get Sasuke back in that one moment,
 theyΓÇÖd probably just focus on guarding the coffin.
 If that happens, we wouldnΓÇÖt stand a chance in the darkness.
 On the contrary,
 for the part where they wouldnΓÇÖt have to move needlessly,
 suddenly theyΓÇÖd get the advantage.
 ItΓÇÖd be a different story if we had NejiΓÇÖs Byakugan, butΓÇª
 Hey, come on.
 ArenΓÇÖt you forgetting AkamaruΓÇÖs nose and mine as well??
 I was sure to include your senses of smell in the calculations!
 Even so, up ahead they have the geographical advantage.
 PlusΓÇª
 if I canΓÇÖt use my Jutsu, itΓÇÖll be no use.
 Even if I seal off their movements with Shadow Possession JutsuΓÇª
 the effect would be reduced to half if clouds were to cover the moon.
 ItΓÇÖs a drag, but there are too many dangers, and uncertain elements.
 But!
 Got it!
 Naruto?
 YouΓÇÖre the leaderΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll follow your instructions, Shikamaru!
 Right. IΓÇÖm counting on you!
 The Vessel Arrives Too Late
 Hey, Tayuya! Will we really make it in time?
 I was just told to deliver Master Sasuke by tomorrow.
 By tomorrow, huh?
 I canΓÇÖt say that we have lots of time to spare,
 but I guess weΓÇÖll make it in time.
 I hope so.
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 No SasukeΓÇªyet?
 HeΓÇÖs running out of timeΓÇª He canΓÇÖt go on any longer.
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 Several bodies have been prepared for you!
 AndΓÇªyou could even use me, if necessaryΓÇª
 It has to be SasukeΓÇª
 How long do you think IΓÇÖve waited?
 ItΓÇÖs a matter of urgency!
 The Third HokageΓÇÖs JutsuΓÇª
 His curse was stronger than expected!
 Take this! Sealing Jutsu! Reaper Death Seal!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this sensation?
 Seal!
 My armΓÇª
 If you donΓÇÖt ΓÇ£reanimateΓÇ¥ right now, youΓÇÖll lose everything!
 Is that what you want?!
 Lose everythingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve selected and prepared proficient bodies for you.
 Please leave it to me! AlsoΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll handle the recovery of Sasuke as well.
 Shall I use Kimimaro?
 Curse you ΓÇª
 Third Hokage!
 Release!
 Listen well, everyone!
 I shall release you from this prisonΓÇª
 However, itΓÇÖll only be one of you!
 Now all thatΓÇÖs left is to wake up Kimimaro, huh?
 Just as I thoughtΓÇª
 I wasnΓÇÖt summoned this time, either.
 Dr. Kabuto, IΓÇª
 Take care of your body.
 Your role is now finished.
 ItΓÇÖs not Sound Ninja Five now, KimimaroΓÇª
 IΓÇªstill havenΓÇÖtΓÇª
 Your replacement has already been found.
 He possesses power equal to your ΓÇ£EarthΓÇ¥ Curse Mark.
 He has been given the ΓÇ£HeavenΓÇ¥ Curse Mark.
 Additionally, he even has the Kekkei Genkai.
 Wonder whoΓÇÖs strongerΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter? DonΓÇÖt get too excited.
 Dr. KabutoΓÇª
 M-My life, how much do I have left?
 You shouldnΓÇÖt talk anymoreΓÇª
 P-PeopleΓÇª People are born with some kind of meaningΓÇª
 Since people are born,
 there must be some kind of important calling.
 Recently IΓÇÖve started thinking soΓÇª
 That the meaning for being bornΓÇª
 For people, finding the meaning isΓÇª
 the only freedom God has given.
 I understand what you want to say.
 Indeed, Lord Orochimaru is now suffering.
 ItΓÇÖs an unprecedented difficult situation,
 but IΓÇÖll mince no words.
 What can you do now?
 YouΓÇÖve now lost your value as a ΓÇ£vessel.ΓÇ¥
 A new vessel is heading this way.
 WellΓÇª
 At this point in time, itΓÇÖs too late, butΓÇª
 Okay! You said you were going to let one person out of here.
 YouΓÇÖre going to keep your promise.
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing? Open the door now!
 What? There was another one?
 Hurry up andΓÇª
 NoΓÇªIΓÇª IΓÇÖll be eaten here, right nowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll let you out of hereΓÇª
 And I shall grant you just one wish.
 My clan that was captured for your experiments.
 Please release them.
 Sure. Consider it done.
 You donΓÇÖt have to worry.
 Your strong will is going to remain as Residual Aura inside me.
 ItΓÇÖs not like youΓÇÖll lose everything.
 Now then, your flesh is mineΓÇª
 With this, Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs body will, once again
 be unable to reanimate for several years.
 However, there is the next time.
 I-IndeedΓÇª
 my body no longer has value as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
 It will now be difficult for me who has lost everythingΓÇª
 to find my own calling.
 IΓÇÖve finally understood thatΓÇª
 Even if itΓÇÖs not me,
 IΓÇÖll bring in the new ΓÇ£vesselΓÇ¥ even if it costs me my life.
 ThatΓÇÖs my repayment to Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the only redemption for me for being worthlessΓÇª
 Hold on a minute!
 Are we almost there?
 NoΓÇª It should still take a while.
 More importantlyΓÇª
 What were those idiots Jirobo and Kidomaru doing?!
 We caught up!
 All right! IΓÇÖll take care of this nice and quick!
 R-Right away?!
 Eat this!
 Multiple Fists Barrage!
 Chakra in his palmΓÇª?!
 Shadow Clone Transformation, eh?
 Rasengan!
 N-No wayΓÇª His hands nowΓÇª?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no point if I catch you before you do it!
 Now, Kiba!
 Tunneling Fang!
 This was also a Shadow Clone?!
 Luring Sakon into alignment with meΓÇª
 and aiming at me from the start?!
 You think you succeeded just with that?!
 Damn!
 IΓÇÖve been nailed.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

 HeΓÇÖs coming!
 Tayuya! WhatΓÇÖre you doing idling away?!
 N-No!
 Why do you move forward?!

 Here you go!
 Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
 Shikamaru! LetΓÇÖs get out of here!
 Yeah!
 PunksΓÇª!
 You scumsΓÇª Messing around with us.
 They were full of openings just as I thought.
 Having too much ability individually is also a problemΓÇª
 It went well.
 Yeah, it went just as calculated!
 Just in terms of teamwork, ours was way better than theirs.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you

 What the--?!
 What happened? I want to know!
 What in the world is Kakashi Sensei thinking? Huh?
 Darn, IΓÇÖm completely flushedΓÇª Huh?
 ΓÇô Our clothes are gone! ΓÇô Our clothes are gone!
 Please come again! Please come again!
 Thank you for coming!
 Please come again! Please come again!
 CrapΓÇªIΓÇÖm going to definitely defeat you, Kakashi Hatake.
 But it was great that we brought spare clothes.
 I wonder who took them awayΓÇª? Our clothes!
 All right, each of you work at your own posts.
 Now, break up.
 I can't stand it anymoreΓÇª
 I have too much stress stored inside.
 IΓÇÖm almost at the end of my patience as wellΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇªactually, me tooΓÇª
 Then, itΓÇÖs the last resort!
 ΓÇô Last resort? ΓÇô Last resort?
 What is this?
 CanΓÇÖt you see? ItΓÇÖs Shinobi outfit.
 When did you get this ready?
 Well, well, never mind that, never mind that.
 What do you do with this?
 WeΓÇÖll strip away the mask. Even if we have to use force!
 Darn KakashiΓÇª
 Boss! Look at that!
 Hey, Kakashi Hatake!
 Hey, what are you guys up to?
 W-What are you talking about? We are simply Ninja.
 It is not that we want to see what is behind your mask--!
 Fool! DonΓÇÖt say unnecessary things!
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Boss! ThereΓÇÖs somebody else besides you who holds a grudge on Kakashi!
 Now is the chance!
 Right! LetΓÇÖs go!
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Right!
 Stop right there!
 Kakashi! ItΓÇÖs time for you to pay for your crime!
 You shall die!
 With this medicine I prepared that will make you cryΓÇª What?!
 Oh, just when I thought how long you guys were going to sneak aroundΓÇª
 you finally come out.
 Ah, well, you knowΓÇª
 But before that, Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!
 Why are you guys dressed like that?
 Huh?! Well, yeah, soΓÇª
 Oh noΓÇª
 We have to make up an explanation, whatever it is!
 Caught you!
 We were well aware that you three were targeting Kakashi Sensei!
 What?! Then our plot was exposed from the beginning!
 Of course! This was a trap to lure you guys out!
 We caught you off guard!
 So we were completely caught in the trap.
 Darn! We underestimated you, thinking it was kids!
 I never heard that story!
 Nice, Sakura!
 I donΓÇÖt quite get whatΓÇÖs happening, but oh wellΓÇª
 ΓÇô Please forgive us! ΓÇô Please forgive us!
 ThereΓÇÖs no use talkingΓÇª
 ΓÇô O-Oh no! 					ΓÇô S-Stop!
 ItΓÇÖs the same as three years ago!
 This time, we're hung by just one rope, combined with the same movement.
 By the way, who are you guys?
 ΓÇô And he doesnΓÇÖt even remember us! ΓÇô And he doesnΓÇÖt even remember us!
 Hey, Kakashi Sensei.
 Yeah?
 What is behind that mask?
 What? You wanted to see whatΓÇÖs behind this mask?
 Yeah!
 Then you should have said that from the beginningΓÇª
 Well, can you show us?
 I donΓÇÖt mindΓÇª
 What the--?!
 Sure thing.
 All rightΓÇª
 Is it like cod roe?
 Buckteeth?
 Or a tiny mouth?
 Behind this maskΓÇª
 ΓÇô Behind that maskΓÇª ΓÇô Behind that maskΓÇª
 There happens to be another mask!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 What--?!
 What in the world is that ?!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Begging your pardon! Begging your pardon!
 I was born and raised in the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
 My given name is Naruto, and the surname is Uzumaki.
 People call me--
 ""The No. 1 Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja""!
 I'm not ""the No. 1 Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja""!
 What's this you've been practicing?
 We're going to meet with Boss Wasabi.
 A proper first greeting's important!

176,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Mess up the villageΓÇªyou say?!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do that no matter what!
 I mean, thereΓÇÖs no way just the four of you can do that!
 But, we canΓÇª
 A person who knows village matters very well gave us information
 on where and how to attack.
 Knows village matters very wellΓÇª
 It couldnΓÇÖt be!
 You mean Orochimaru?!
 Who knowsΓÇª?
 Well, thatΓÇÖs how it is, so we canΓÇÖt have you guys living.
 Umm, can you see this?
 Paper Bombs!
 WeΓÇÖre going to detonate the Paper Bombs
 after weΓÇÖve left hereΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs nowhere to runΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no chance of someone coming to save you.
 Prepare yourselves.
 ItΓÇÖs better than going back to the Academy, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Umm, rest in peace.
 H-Hey! Just a minute!
 Farewell, real me.
 Run, Dodge, Zigzag! Chase or be Chased!
 It shouldΓÇÖve just been hunting for treasure,
 but to think this would happenΓÇª
 Sure enough, nothing good comes
 of being together with you on missions, Naruto!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be saying stuff like that!
 TheyΓÇÖre attempting to mess up the Leaf Village by impersonating us!
 Then howΓÇÖre we going to get out of here?!
 WellΓÇª
 If I use the Rasengan, I could somehowΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖd notice that!
 ItΓÇÖd be the end if we were to get ambushed outside.
 Then, with your Fang Over FangΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖd be the same, the same!
 You moron!
 Then what should we do?!
 ΓÇô UmmΓÇª 					ΓÇô Huh?
 If I use my Protective 8 Trigrams 64 PalmsΓÇª
 I get it!
 With that we can weather this crisis without the guys outside noticing!
 If I could just loosen these ropes a littleΓÇª
 Leave that to me!
 N-Naruto?!
 All right!
 Me, too!
 KibaΓÇª
 AkamaruΓÇª
 Just a little moreΓÇª
 It snappedΓÇª
 Protective 8 TrigramsΓÇª
 64 Palms!
 Now then, shall we go as arranged?
 ΓÇô Kiba! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 ΓÇô Hinata! 					ΓÇô Yes!
 Naruto!
 I know!
 Hinata!
 You okay?
 OhΓÇª!
 WhatΓÇª?
 Hey, Hinata! Cut our ropes before you faint.
 Right.
 It seems the guys outside are gone.
 It doesnΓÇÖt look like this place is going to hold up now.
 It looks like itΓÇÖd be best for us to escape as soon as we can.
 WhatΓÇÖs that?!
 ItΓÇÖs the buried treasure chest.
 Leave it be!
 ItΓÇÖs a fake anyway.
 And there might be some kind of trap set.
 But itΓÇÖs our mission to take this back with us, soΓÇª
 There really might be buried treasure in it, right?!
 Byakugan!
 It looks empty insideΓÇª Wait, thereΓÇÖs paper inside.
 IsnΓÇÖt it a Paper Bomb?
 It doesnΓÇÖt seem to be anything dangerousΓÇª
 Then I guess IΓÇÖll take it for now.
 Come on, thereΓÇÖs no need to go to the trouble ofΓÇª
 But it might make for a good mark to distinguish him from the imposterΓÇª
 I get it.
 Akamaru, youΓÇÖre the mark for the real me, so stay close to me.
 ThereΓÇÖs no time.
 IΓÇÖll be going with our Fang Over Fang. Make sure you keep up!
 R-Right.
 Man-Beast CloneΓÇª
 Fang Over Fang!
 You okay, Hinata?
 IΓÇÖm fineΓÇª I just have to follow after Kiba, soΓÇªIΓÇÖll be oΓÇª
 Hinata!
 All right!
 You okay, Hinata?
 Naruto!
 Does your leg hurt?
 KibaΓÇª
 If your leg hurts, say so first.
 I was thinking I must not cause trouble, soΓÇª
 Actually, that is trouble.
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Surprisingly, this might be the weakness of our team.
 HuhΓÇª?
 Hinata shows too much concern for us.
 Naruto and I speak too bluntly to each other and we get into fightsΓÇª
 N-Now that you mention itΓÇª
 If weΓÇÖd take on our missions while being a little conscious of stuff like that,
 we mightΓÇª become a pretty good team.
 Got it!
 IΓÇÖll tryΓÇª
 All right. Then Naruto and I will go after those guys.
 Hinata, you come later. Your legΓÇÖs hurt, so donΓÇÖt force thingsΓÇª
 Got it.
 Listen up. YouΓÇÖre hurt, Hinata. So you follow later.
 I just said that, didnΓÇÖt I?
 Huh? Did you?
 RightΓÇªThanksΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Naruto!
 I have to hurry, tooΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm back!
 YouΓÇÖre back, Naruto?
 We couldnΓÇÖt catch up with them, huhΓÇª?
 Naruto? Kiba?!
 Was I here just now?!
 Y-Yeah.
 That one was an imposter!
 Say what?!
 But the dog didnΓÇÖt notice anythingΓÇª
 He canΓÇÖt be sniffed out even with the nose of a Ninja Hound!
 Akamaru was fooled, too!
 WeΓÇÖve got trouble! To the Hokage, immediately.
 Right!
 Akamaru! You remember the smell of that Agari old man, right?!
 After him!
 Lady Tsunade!
 WeΓÇÖve just received a communicationΓÇª!
 Nobody realizes it.
 Stay sharp. Our mission isnΓÇÖt over yet, so.
 ThatΓÇÖs right. The crucial part comes now.
 SomeoneΓÇÖs coming!
 We found you, imposters!
 WeΓÇÖll kick your butts!
 Oh-hoΓÇª So youΓÇÖre aliveΓÇª
 Naturally!
 This time itΓÇÖs your turn to prepare yourselvesΓÇª
 After all, this is our home field.
 There are times when you lose
 even when fighting on your home field!
 We wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 H-Hinata?!
 IΓÇÖm going to inform the Hokage!
 Naruto, you go after the imposters!
 Got  ΓÇªit.
 HeyΓÇª
 Upon careful thought, the real Hinata hasnΓÇÖt come yetΓÇª!
 You imposter!
 What theΓÇª?!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing to Hinata?!
 ItΓÇÖs just like IΓÇÖm the imposter.
 Naruto!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 W-WellΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs an imposter!
 What?!
 Prepare yourself, imposter!
 Hey! Wait a minuteΓÇª!
 Hey, youΓÇÖre also an imposter!
 Even if you can copy the appearance and scent,
 you canΓÇÖt go so far as copy Ninjutsu, right?!
 LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru.
 Fang OverΓÇª?
 Knocked outΓÇª?
 No way. It was just a punch, and I didnΓÇÖt even use a JutsuΓÇª
 Come to think of itΓÇª
 I was slugged good and hard, but I didnΓÇÖt feel it at all.
 Hey! WerenΓÇÖt you going to mess up the village?!
 You guys are utterly weak!
 Damn it!
 IΓÇÖll catch the fake Hinata, so you handle yourself somehow!
 Leave me to me!
 Hold it!
 Hold it!
 I wonder if I got overly ambitious and borrowed too many booksΓÇª
 Hey, Naruto!
 YouΓÇª
 You moron!
 YouΓÇÖre butt is so heavy you fell right on it!
 Ugly! Ugly!
 Forehead girl!
 IΓÇÖll kick your butt the next time I see you!
 IΓÇÖll kick your butt, no matter what!
 Sakura, get out of the way!
 Naruto.
 IΓÇÖll kick your butt!
 Wh-Why?!
 What?
 WhyΓÇÖs the Naruto who ran that way coming from over here?
 IΓÇÖm off on a delivery.
 Right. Take care.
 What is it?! You okay, Ayame?!
 Y-Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew inΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª?
 Na-ru-to!
 How dare you do that to my daughterΓÇª?!
 Wh-WhatΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm okay, Dad.
 No, you rest a bit.
 I will have Naruto take the responsibility and make the delivery!
 What?!
 But, but IΓÇª
 If you refuse,
 IΓÇÖll never let you eat my ramen ever again!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time for me to be making a delivery!
 I finished the delivery!
 Okay! Good work!
 Where did he go?!
 MyΓÇªimposter!
 This jerk was also weakΓÇª
 KibaΓÇª StopΓÇª 					Forgive meΓÇª
 That mightΓÇÖve worked on Naruto. But I hate soppy stuffΓÇª
 like that!
 Did these guys seriously intend to attack the villageΓÇª?
 Where are you, imposter?!
 Come out!
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Could it be that I came here?
 Yeah, you did.
 YouΓÇÖll be paying me for what you ate earlier.
 That jerkΓÇª!
 Forty-five platesΓÇª
 Here.
 Eating and running with someone elseΓÇÖs faceΓÇª
 That imposterΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs not messing up the village, heΓÇÖs messing up my reputation.
 HeyΓÇª
 No wayΓÇª!
 My Golden Delicious Ninja Way Ramen Pure Heart of Fire
 IΓÇÖd been setting aside!
 I wonΓÇÖt allow itΓÇª!
 No matter what, I wonΓÇÖt allow itΓÇª!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ΓÇô Go! 					ΓÇô Go!
 ΓÇô Where is he?! ΓÇô WhereΓÇÖs the imposter?!
 ΓÇô Where are you?! ΓÇô Imposter!
 Where are you?! Come out!
 IΓÇÖll kill you, imposter!
 IΓÇÖll pay the bill later!
 ΓÇô Find him! 					ΓÇô Where is he?!
 There he is!
 Hey!
 ΓÇô I wonΓÇÖt let you get away! ΓÇô Got you!
 ΓÇô IΓÇÖve got you! ΓÇô You're wrong!
 ΓÇô Is it you?! ΓÇô IΓÇÖm not an imposter!
 Calm down, guys!
 The imposter isnΓÇÖt carrying a chest on his back!
 ΓÇô What? 					ΓÇô It's not him?
 ΓÇô Now that you mention itΓÇª ΓÇô That's right.
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 ThenΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs him!
 Yikes!
 At the end of the day, these guys were nothing special.
 Hey, are these guys really OrochimaruΓÇÖs henchmen?
 Who knows?
 The Hokage will look into the details for us.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Man, IΓÇÖm tired.
 My shoulders got stiff from carrying this thing around the whole time.
 Naruto! Kiba!
 Oh, the real HinataΓÇÖs come back.
 Hey, Hinata! Over here!
 Naruto!
 HeΓÇÖs not carrying the chest on his backΓÇª Then this NarutoΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs the imposter!
 Gentle Fist!
 Oh, boy. I feel bad for that NarutoΓÇª
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 A test?!
 This mission was a test
 in order to see the teamwork of you three.
 A Shinobi will often have to form teams with various others
 in response to the qualities and conditions of the mission.
 At such times,
 failing if teamed with a certain other person is a problem.
 And so I gave you a mission that was easy at the start.
 And I made it so along the wayΓÇª
 something would happen involving a village crisis.
 At that time,
 I wanted to see whether you could handle it as a team.
 So thatΓÇÖs what it wasΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs harsh!
 We wouldΓÇÖve died if weΓÇÖd made the slightest mistake.
 ItΓÇÖs okay. I got the story about you guys from Lady Tsunade.
 It was set up so even if you were to make a mistake,
 you would only be injured.
 Since this time around you had the Ninja HoundDog Akamaru,
 I enlisted the help of the Kedouin ClanΓÇª
 so you wouldnΓÇÖt be able to distinguish the enemy.
 And?
 How did these three do?
 Let me seeΓÇª
 They floundered part of the way and I was worried about the outcomeΓÇª
 But I shall pass them.
 In terms of results, they did capture us, soΓÇª
 Oh yeah.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 It was more or less our mission to bring this, so.
 With this, our mission is complete.
 ThereΓÇÖs no point in going to the trouble of bringingΓÇª
 No, no.
 There is something important inside that I must give to you, Lady Hokage.
 Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy.
 You, too.
 See ya.
 Yeah.
 Are they going to look like that forever?
 It seems theyΓÇÖll get their own faces back naturally in a few days.
 I seeΓÇª
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?!
 A bill for the recent trainingΓÇª?!
 HereΓÇªhe said heΓÇÖd be glad to cooperateΓÇª
 It comes to this much?
 This is a hard world to live in, isnΓÇÖt it?
 My name is TsunadeΓÇª
 My concern now is a debt that absolutely will not go down.
 More like, itΓÇÖs growing, isnΓÇÖt it?
 I shouldnΓÇÖt have becomeΓÇª the likes of HokageΓÇª!
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 No, itΓÇÖs gone, gone, gone! WhereΓÇÖd you put it, Naruto?
 Oh, if you mean that, I wrote it.
 You wrote it?
 And I gave it to a Delivery Ninja.
 You gave it?
 So it should reach the other party today.
 You idiot! At this rate, my life as a writer willΓÇª
 More importantly, letΓÇÖs get the training started.
 Shut up and come with me, Naruto!
 We have to get that back at any cost!

 And what was that red Chakra earlier on?
 Is this guy a monster?

 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖm telling you
 IΓÇÖm not gonna let the likes of Orochimaru get you!
 IΓÇÖm telling you that IΓÇÖll stop youΓÇª
 even if it means breaking every bone in your arm and legs!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

 Shut upΓÇª
 What the heck do you,
 who has neither parents nor brothers, think you understand?
 What makes you think that you, who's been all alone from the start,
 can understand anything about me?!
 ItΓÇÖs because I have the ties that I feel this agony.
 How could you possibly understandΓÇª
 what it feels like to lose all that!
 ItΓÇÖs true that I canΓÇÖt understandΓÇª
 how it feels to really have parents or brothersΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs my treat todayΓÇª Eat your fill!

 If this isΓÇª what it feels like to have a dad.
 When IΓÇÖm with youΓÇª
 Idiot, idiot, idiotΓÇª
 What was that, you loser?!
 IΓÇÖm not gonna lose to you, no matter what!
 Go ahead and say whatever you want.
 How about this?
 Better not start feeling too comfortable.
 I wonderΓÇªif having a brother feels something like that.
 Why is it, NarutoΓÇª?
 Why is it that you go to this extent for meΓÇª?
 For me itΓÇÖs a tie that IΓÇÖve finally been able to have!
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖm gonna stop you.
 ItΓÇÖs too late, NarutoΓÇª ltΓÇÖs already too late.
 I canΓÇÖt go back anymore.
 Come, Naruto!
 In that case, I just have to cut that tie.
 Cut, huh?
 Then why wear that headband now?
 IΓÇÖll acknowledge youΓÇª YouΓÇÖre strong.
 And the reason for that is
 youΓÇÖre someone who knows the pain of solitude as I do.
 And that pain makes people stronger.
 And for that very reason, by cutting that tie,
 I will be able to obtain even greater strength.
 I will fight you now on equal terms. HoweverΓÇª
 You won't even be able to inflict a scratch on my forehead.
 ThatΓÇÖs something that wonΓÇÖt change in the least.
 It seems that whatever I say wonΓÇÖt have any effect anymore, huh?
 Sasuke!
 IΓÇÖm done with talkingΓÇª
 From here on, itΓÇÖs only fighting.
 Come!
 IΓÇÖm able to seeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm now able to see this guyΓÇÖs movementsΓÇª
 which I wasnΓÇÖt able to see before.
 IΓÇÖm able to see them!
 SasukeΓÇÖs moving completely different from a few moments ago.
 But I couldnΓÇÖt care less!
 In any case, I canΓÇÖt afford to lose!
 Damn it!
 It must be the influence of my body getting used to the state of Curse Mark.
 When he movesΓÇª
 by the subtle movements in the way he exerts his strengthΓÇª
 I can vividly see an image of his next move.
 With my level of ΓÇ£eyes,ΓÇ¥
 I donΓÇÖt need to use unnecessary Chakra and can instead preserve it.
 The Curse Mark takes too much Chakra.
 If I can see this muchΓÇª
 I can time my attacks to the images of NarutoΓÇÖs movements as I foresee them.
 This is no goodΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs totally reading my movements.
 Damn it!
 Oh, there you are.
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake itΓÇÖs this way, right?
 Right.
 We better hurry. I have a bad premonition.

 ItΓÇÖs too late, Naruto.
 ItΓÇÖs too late now! Naruto!
 You're weak, arenΓÇÖt you, kid?
 You better be grateful to meΓÇª
 and to the Fourth Hokage
 who contained me within the likes of you!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 What was that just now?
 Even if IΓÇÖm able to read NarutoΓÇÖs movements completelyΓÇª
 his Chakra makes a separate move of its own.
 It seems like the Chakra itself is moving in accordance with its own willΓÇª
 Even with my ΓÇ£eyesΓÇ¥ IΓÇÖm unable to read it completely.
 That red ChakraΓÇª thatΓÇÖs not an ordinary Chakra!
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority
 placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 I seeΓÇª
 It appears that you have some kind of special power.
 Now I understand!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 That Chakra is protecting him?!
 Calm down.
 I wonΓÇÖt be caught as long as I fight from distance.
 Damn itΓÇª This is incredible!
 All I can do is dodgeΓÇª
 Please let me get there in time.
 Damn it, gimme a breakΓÇª
 If I get tainted by this power ΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt even know what will happen to me in the endΓÇª
 But, it canΓÇÖt be helped, can it, Naruto?
 It is certainly true that you were specialΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 I am even more special than you.
 Sasuke!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 Damn! My body hurts!
 And to make it worse,
 IΓÇÖve completely lost feeling in my left arm!
 Apparently this power isnΓÇÖt something that
 I can just keep on using continuously!
 But ΓÇªI canΓÇÖt give up!
 My next blow is going to be the end!

 Even if you are like this now, you stillΓÇª
 Open your eyes! Wake up, please!
 Shut up, Shizune!
 You donΓÇÖt have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Also, two human sacrifices are needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,
 so do what you need to do to prepare them.
 Lady Tsunade, letΓÇÖs kill them right here! ltΓÇÖs our chance!
 With you and me, now we canΓÇª!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Sure, I am weak now.
 HoweverΓÇª
 I also know TsunadeΓÇÖs weakness.
 ThatΓÇÖs right, he is one of the Sannin like Tsunade.
 So he knows thatΓÇª
 I see itΓÇÖs not cured yetΓÇª
 your fear of blood.
 HemophobiaΓÇª?
 Shall we get going, Kabuto?
 TsunadeΓÇª IΓÇÖll be expecting a favorable answer from you.
 Looks like we were a little too lateΓÇª
 Is this that snakeΓÇÖs doing, too?!
 ΓÇô LetΓÇÖs go, Naruto! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Tsunade isnΓÇÖt here any more.
 Geez, you keep telling me thatΓÇª!
 Welcome!
 Hey, you olΓÇÖ man, give me another shot!
 Lady Tsunade, youΓÇÖre drinking too much!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Heck, sheΓÇÖs nowhere to be found!
 Dragging me around here and there,
 but after all, we havenΓÇÖt found a single trace!
 Hmm?
 Well, letΓÇÖs dine here for now.
 Huh?
 IsnΓÇÖt this a pub?
 So what?
 I've told you so many times! IΓÇÖm still underage!
 You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink. Kids should only be eating snacks.
 ΓÇô Well thenΓÇª 					ΓÇô Welcome!
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to dine here!
 We can go to a ramen noodle shop or something!
 How stupid! You can gather information in this type of placeΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª?
 Huh?!
 Tsunade!
 Jiraiya?!
 WhyΓÇªare you here?
 IΓÇÖve finally found you! IΓÇÖm exhaustedΓÇª
 That gal is Tsunade?!
 SheΓÇÖs 50 years old for real?
 Now, thatΓÇÖs a swindle.
 I canΓÇÖt believeΓÇª I met two of the Sannin in one day.
 Here you are!
 In any caseΓÇª Today is a day I see many old friends.
 You mean OrochimaruΓÇª
 What happened?
 Nothing, really. We exchanged a greeting.
 Is it really true that this gal is the Kunoichi
 who can heal any kind of wound?
 What about you?
 What do you want from me?
 IΓÇÖll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demanded that you become the Fifth Hokage.
 Hey, olΓÇÖ man, gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!
 All right, in a moment.
 The Fifth Hokage?! WhatΓÇÖs this out of the blue?!
 What the heck is going on?!
 Do you know about the Third Hokage?
 The Third Hokage? So, he really wasΓÇª
 Orochimaru did it, right?
 I heard about it. directly from him.
 Orochimaru did itΓÇª?
 Orochimaru?!
 Did he really killed the old man, the Third Hokage?!
 Who is this Orochimaru?!
 Just like us, heΓÇÖs one of the Sannin.
 Why?! The Sannin are all from Leaf Village, right?
 Then why--?!
 WhoΓÇÖs this brat?
 HeΓÇÖs Naruto Uzumaki.
 This brat isΓÇª that Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇª?
 Hey, you just hold it there!
 I am not done talking yet!
 This Orochimaru?! This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.
 Who the heck is he?!
 HeΓÇÖs a legendary Sannin, right?!
 Then knowing thatΓÇª
 why would you, Pervy Sage, leave such a guy alone?!
 BesidesΓÇª
 What do you mean this person is the Fifth Hokage?!
 Naruto, be quiet for a moment.
 ButΓÇª!
 Just shut up!
 IΓÇÖll say this again.
 They are demanding that you become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.
 So whatΓÇÖs your answer?
 Will you accept it?
 IΓÇÖll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you lovedΓÇª
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!
 What do you sayΓÇªTsunade?
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 I really donΓÇÖt get it!
 ImpossibleΓÇª
 I refuse!
 I rememberΓÇªthose words.
 You said those same words when I asked you to go out with me.
 What the heck are you talking about?! You said it yourself!
 DidnΓÇÖt you say that you will bring her back to the village
 and have her treat Sasuke and Kakashi Sensei ?!
 But whatΓÇÖs this demand for her to be the Hokage?!
 And, on top of that, she refuses!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Could she be thinking of making a deal with Orochimaru?
 Calm down.
 There canΓÇÖt be no other Fifth Hokage, but this Tsunade.
 During the dreadful Great War Era,
 she contributed tremendously to the LeafΓÇÖs victory.
 To this date,
 thereΓÇÖs no one who can rival her combat and medical skills.
 Still more, this Tsunade is the granddaughter of the First Hokage.
 So together with her talents,
 thereΓÇÖs no one else more suited to becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 If she becomes Hokage,
 that means that sheΓÇÖll come back to the village.
 And then, as IΓÇÖd told you, she can treat the two.
 Besides, this is what the LeafΓÇÖs top decision-making advisors settled upon.
 Genin like you have no say on this matter.
 JiraiyaΓÇª
 Unlike your previous apprentice,
 this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit, heΓÇÖs ugly to match.
 What?!
 ItΓÇÖs tough on anyone to be compared to the Fourth Hokage.
 He had all the qualities to be the greatest Ninja in all history.
 Brimming with talent in Jutsu, and he had a brilliant mind!
 Popular with people and wellΓÇª he was as handsome as me.
 But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.
 Risking his own life for the villageΓÇª
 Life is different from moneyΓÇª
 To easily risk it and lose it, is a foolΓÇÖs doing!
 Did she say ΓÇ£foolΓÇ¥?!
 Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage
 seemed to want to subdue the disturbances of war above all else.
 But after all, they died in vain,
 in the midst of their dreams for the village.
 You have changed, TsunadeΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know what you thought in your heart before,
 but to say such thing out loudΓÇª
 Although I look young, IΓÇÖm already in my 50sΓÇª
 Years change people.
 Same goes for Sarutobi SenseiΓÇª
 No wonder he died showing off at that old age!
 Hokage is a bother.
 No one but a fool would take it on.
 Why you--?!
 ΓÇô Let go of me! ΓÇô Don't! We're in a pub.
 I said, let go of me!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª!
 Anyone who makes fun of the old man and the Fourth HokageΓÇª
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter if you are a woman!
 IΓÇÖll clobber you with all my might!
 YouΓÇÖre pretty gutsyΓÇª confronting me like this.
 LetΓÇÖs take this outside, brat!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Though I may not look it, I am one of the Sannin.
 Why should I even take a Genin seriously.
 What did you say?!
 An advance notice for a KO?
 I donΓÇÖt mean one minuteΓÇª
 With one finger. This is enough to take you down.
 Lady Tsunade!
 WellΓÇª
 Come on, kiddo.
 D-DonΓÇÖt make fun of me!
 Darn it!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Forehead poking?!
 Why that no good--!
 SheΓÇÖs strongΓÇª
 Hey, brat!
 IΓÇÖll ask you one thing before you faint.
 WhyΓÇªget so passionate at the mention of HokageΓÇÖs name?
 Unlike youΓÇª
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name, no matter what!
 Because Hokage isΓÇª
 Because Hokage is my dream!
 That kidΓÇª
 What? SheΓÇÖs a bit off her guardΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt tackle her head on.
 Then, I should use that Jutsu nowΓÇª
 Concentrate!
 Oh, no!
 Wha--?! This Jutsu isΓÇª!
 Take this!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 It's been a long time since we drank alone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?
 I didn't necessarily want to see you.
 Don't say that.
 By the way, you're prettier than before.
 You haven't changed a bit.
 Understand this. I'm not interested in you.
 Neither am I. After all, you're actually 50 years old--
 ΓÇô Did you say something? ΓÇô No, nothing.
 I was just remembering the old days.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Today'sΓÇªa special day, soΓÇª
 Time to eat!
 Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?
 Fight me, here!
 What're you doing, Konohamaru?
 Very good, NarutoΓÇª
 You're the man I expected you to be.
 I didn't do anything, you knowΓÇª
 Let's fight fair!
 Sorry! I've got an orientation meeting to go to.
 An orientation meetingΓÇª?
 CauseΓÇª As of today, I'm a Ninja!
 OhΓÇª
 Sakura! Shouldn't you be heading out soon?
 I was thinking of leaving now!
 Cha! How long are you planning to treat me like a child?!
 That's rightΓÇª I'm not a student of the academy anymoreΓÇª
 I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village, Sakura Haruno!
 I'm off!
 Morning, Sakura.
 Morning... Ino.
 Who would've thought you'd be able to graduate.
 Ancient history has nothing to do with it.
 As of today, we're both full-fledged Ninjas...
 I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!
 What the--? Why are you here?
 Today's meeting is for graduates only.
 Hey, don't you see this headband?
 As of today, I'm a Ninja, too!
 How can I put it, it really suits me.
 So NarutoΓÇªwas able to graduate.
 Goal!
 I won again, Sakura!
 What're you sayingΓÇª?
 The tip of my foot got in one centimeter faster!
 You must be blind.
 It's Sakura.
 OhΓÇª
 Sakura's looking at meΓÇª
 Hey, Sakura!
 Mor... morning, Sakur--
 Get outta' the way!
 M-Morning, SasukeΓÇª
 Mind if I sit next to you?
 Hey! I'm going to sit next to Sasuke!
 First come, first served!
 I got in the classroom sooner!
 I did!
 If that's the case, then I did!
 I was first!
 I'm sitting next to Sasuke!
 How annoying...
 Is that this year's top rookie, Sasuke Uchiha?
 Yes.
 The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan?
 Yes.
 Naruto Uzumaki, ehΓÇª
 Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke.
 What's so great about this guy?!
 Just beat him up, Sasuke!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 What? Really?
 Oh! Sorry!
 Wha--?
 Whoa!
 Cha! I was planning on seizing Sasuke's first kiss!
 You jerkΓÇª Naruto! I'll kill you!
 ΓÇô My mouth is rotting. ΓÇô Huh? Was that my fault?
 What? I feel rageΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 YouΓÇª
 An accidentΓÇª lt was an accident
 You are annoying!
 Yikes!
 NarutoΓÇªHe's at the center of trouble as usual.
 As of today, you all have become full-fledged NinjasΓÇª
 However, you're still Genin.
 The tough part's still to come!
 From here on, you'll be in a squad of three
 and carry out your missions under your Jonin teachers.
 A squad of three?!
 I wonder who's going to be grouped with Sasuke.
 I don't knowΓÇª
 Cha! I'll be the one grouped with Sasuke, naturally!
 Squads of three, eh. lt'll just slow me downΓÇª
 First will be Sakura.
 And the other personΓÇª
 can be anyone other than Sasuke!
 The groups have been determined
 so that the strength of the groups will be balanced.
 Now for the assignments!
 Now then, next is Group SevenΓÇª
 Naruto Uzumaki!
 Sakura Haruno.
 Hooray!
 I'm withΓÇªNarutoΓÇª?
 AndΓÇªSasuke Uchiha!
 Hooray!
 I'm withΓÇªSasukeΓÇª?
 So I'll be in a different group from Naruto, huhΓÇª
 Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga!
 Y-YesΓÇª
 Kiba Inuzuka!
 Shino Aburame!
 Why is this happeningΓÇª?
 Group Nine.
 Cha! Love will be victorious!
 ManΓÇª
 Why do women think that kind of guy's so greatΓÇª?
 Don't you understand, Shikamaru?
 Well, I'm not a womanΓÇª
 That's why you are not popular among girls.
 I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.
 Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka.  Shikamaru Nara.
 It appears we've been grouped together.
 And Choji Akimichi.
 And Fatty on top of that...
 That's all for the group division.
 Iruka Sensei!
 Why does an exceptional student like me have to be
 in the same group with this guy?!
 Sasuke has the best grades of the graduates.
 Naruto, you're at the bottom!
 Of course, this is how it is when trying to balance the strength within groups.
 Just don't get in my way, loser!
 Hey, what did you say?!
 You want to fight, loser?
 Knock it off, Naruto!!
 In the afternoon, I'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers.
 You're dismissed until then!
 Sasuke!
 Where'd you go, Sasuke?
 I thought since we're in the same group and all, we'd eat together.
 Sakuraaaa!
 Since we're in the same group and all, let's eat together!
 Why should I have to eat with you?!
 Well... we're in the same group, soΓÇª
 You'reΓÇªannoying.
 Sasuke! Where are you?
 Darn! This is no fun.
 I 'm finally in the same group as SakuraΓÇª and then it's like thisΓÇª
 I wonder if something good will happenΓÇª
 That's it!
 Listen up!
 As long as we're in the same group, you will follow my instructions.
 Yeah-yeahΓÇª
 She becomes a real pain in the neck when people try to argue with to her, soΓÇª
 Let's all go out for some BBQ sometime.
 Oh, manΓÇª
 Hmm?
 NarutoΓÇª?
 Huh?
 Oh!
 Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it!
 Darn! Just be quiet.
 Naruto! I won't forgive you if you hurt Sasuke!
 What happened?
 Heh! IdiotΓÇª
 So Naruto got beaten by the one he challengedΓÇª
 Of course! Naruto's no match  for Sasuke!
 No need for me to feel rushedΓÇª
 From here on out,
 I'll be in the same group as Sasuke for the long haulΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 Even if I were to use my feminine charmsΓÇª
 my proportions are below averageΓÇª
 All that's above average is  the width of my foreheadΓÇª
 What should I doΓÇª?
 Huh? No way!
 SasukeΓÇªis looking...
 this way!
 And with such a passionate look!
 YouΓÇªhave a charmingly wide forehead.
 It makes me want to kiss it.
 That's what its surface area is for.
 Yeah, rightΓÇª
 I'm not just some kid who believes in fairy talesΓÇª
 There's no way.
 YouΓÇªhave a charmingly wide forehead.
 What?!
 It makes me want to kiss it.
 Cha! This fairy tale is for real!!
 Or that's what Naruto would say.
 I've got something to ask you.
 What?
 What do you thinkΓÇªof Naruto?
 He's quite at home interfering and enjoys it when I make mistakes.
 Naruto doesn't understand one thing about meΓÇª
 He just annoys me!
 All I wantΓÇªis for you to accept me, Sasuke.ΓÇª
 For me to accept youΓÇª?
 I'll do anything for the sake of that.
 I was careless!
 W-Wha--?!
 Gotcha!
 I didn't think someone who couldn't perform the Clone Jutsu properly
 could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I'mΓÇªdesperate, soΓÇª
 I finally know why IΓÇª
 I like Sakura so much.
 Diarrhea at a time like this?!
 What's wrong?
 I-I'll be right backΓÇª 225	01:41:53:26	01:41:56:04 Sasuke's so shy!
 I guess he needs to prepare himself mentallyΓÇª
 That was close!
 My stomach hurt so much that the Jutsu was about to wear off!
 Why does my stomach have to hurt at such a good time?!
 I'm annoying... huhΓÇª
 She said so againΓÇª
 And I transformed into Sasuke and had got a little closer to SakuraΓÇª
 In that caseΓÇª I'll play an obnoxious Sasuke ΓÇª
 and make her hate him!
 Oh Sasuke, you're such a shy bad boy!
 Are you prepared? I'm raring to go!
 H-Hey, Sasuke!
 Where's Naruto?
 Oh, there you go changing the subject againΓÇª
 Just leave Naruto alone!
 All he does is pick fights with you!
 It's because he wasn't raised right!
 You know!
 He doesn't have any parents, right?
 He always selfishly does  whatever he wants!
 My parents would get mad at me if I did something like that!
 There are no parents to nag you if it's just you alone!
 So his selfishness comes out at various times!
 The loneliness.
 Huh?
 It's something worse than getting scolded by parents and...
 W-What's gotten into youΓÇª?
 YouΓÇª
 annoy me.
 Darn! It finally stopped!
 I wonder if Sakura's still waiting.
 W-What are you doing here?!
 I used the Escape Jutsu, the very basic of techniques.
 Oh...
 What were you planning to doΓÇª
 by transforming into me?!
 I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?!
 I'll show you that I'm really amazing!
 I'll defeat youΓÇª
 and make you accept me!
 Prepare yourself, Sasuke!
 Just like that, my stomach againΓÇª
 B-Bathroom!
 I'm first, I say!
 I'm first, I say.
 I'm about to go in my pants, I say!
 How stupid!
 ""You annoy me"" ΓÇªhuh?
 I see. So this is how Naruto must've feltΓÇª
 I wonder if I canΓÇª be a bit more nice next timeΓÇª
 Darn.
 Did I eat something bad?
 NarutoΓÇª
 SmileΓÇªSmileΓÇª
 Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto.
 SakuraΓÇª
 Payback for earlier, huh?
 Sasuke's turned himself into SakuraΓÇª
 You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?!
 I don't think so!
 Ow-ow-owΓÇª What the heck is going on?!
 OhΓÇª
 You idiot, Naruto!
 So, this is Naruto's roomΓÇª
 And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is  also in the group you'll be in charge of.
 I wish you good luck!
 The expiration dateΓÇª
 of this milk has passed quite awhile agoΓÇª
 He'll get sick if he drink this.
 It seems like that things are going to get disastrous.
 What the heck is going on?!
 What is going on?!
 This isn't the same Kakashi Sensei from yesterday.
 Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei
 who got caught in my trap and breezily came late?
 Darn it! Darn it!
 No way am I giving up!
 I'll defeat him and clear this super difficult testl!
 No way am I going back now!
 Next episode:  ""Pass or Fail: Survival Test""

116,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
 Uh-oh!
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms!
 4 Palms!
 8 Palms!
 16 Palms!
 32 Palms!
 64 Palms!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 A golden body surfaceΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs the same material as the weapon he spit out of his mouth earlierΓÇª
 That was close.
 I hear that if youΓÇÖre hit straight on with Gentle Fist,
 your Chakra Network gets damaged
 and you become unable to build up ChakraΓÇª
 That was close.
 Are you a monster?
 It seems to come not just from your mouth.
 Gum Style Spider ThreadΓÇª
 is a metal that hardens the instant it leaves my body.
 Moreover, it doesnΓÇÖt let Chakra through.
 AndΓÇªit can be secreted not just from my mouth,
 but also from the sweat glands throughout my body.
 Attacks on Chakra points wonΓÇÖt work. Now it makes senseΓÇª
 The Spider Web Net wonΓÇÖt work.
 And thereΓÇÖll be no close-range combat fighting
 against a Gentle Fist opponent.
 In other words,
 I just have to attack the blind side from long distance.
 ThereΓÇÖll be no soundΓÇª ltΓÇÖll be in a flash.
 The gameΓÇÖs over.
 The Kunai Knife is a fake!
 What?!
 8 Trigrams PalmΓÇª
 Rotation!
 WhaΓÇô?! What is that?!
 Does heΓÇªhave eyes behind him?!
 And the defense just nowΓÇª
 He repelled physical attacks with Chakra?!
 360 Degrees of Vision: The Byakugan's Blind Spot!
 If weΓÇÖre not prepared for ΓÇ£one person, one kill,ΓÇ¥
 then itΓÇÖs not going to work outΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what you said earlier.
 Hurry up and go! IΓÇÖll catch up with you all!
 We have to be prepared for ΓÇ£one person, one kill.ΓÇ¥
 NarutoΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve got better eyes than me.
 NejiΓÇª
 Catch up with us, no matter what!
 Can he see me?!
 What the heck is he?!
 I know youΓÇÖre there.
 Come out.
 Those eyesΓÇª
 It seems they can do more than just see through the Chakra flowΓÇª
 So I see there was an extraordinary Visual Jutsu user.
 A long range battle is unfavorableΓÇª
 I must bring this to close combat by all means.
 Very well.
 IΓÇÖll acknowledge that this game has a somewhat high level of difficulty!
 I too shall go for it seriouslyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs like heΓÇÖs a totally different person from beforeΓÇª
 His Chakra activity is overwhelming.
 And those markingsΓÇª
 His move earlierΓÇª
 He dodged an attack aimed from behind
 and was able to see me hiding in the shadows.
 In other words,
 he has a combined wide range of sight and X-ray vision.
 And whatΓÇÖs more, that JutsuΓÇª
 If soΓÇª
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Your abilityΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll find a way to impeccably assault it.
 If he defends against physical attacks
 with a large emission of Chakra and its RotationΓÇª
 all I need to do then is to stop that Chakra Rotation!
 Scatter!
 Rotation!
 ItΓÇÖs starting to stop.
 Here!
 Die!
 He released the Chakra just in time and repelled the Kunai Knife!
 To think heΓÇÖd stop my Chakra Rotation
 by binding it with Chakra threadsΓÇª
 These thingsΓÇª
 I just have to cut them for now.
 If the Rotation wonΓÇÖt do,
 then I just have to dodge each and every one.
 This guy uses close-range Taijutsu-style combat .
 There will be no problem if I fight him from afar.
 In that wayΓÇª IΓÇÖll have a good long look at your ability.
 8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!
 What a number!
 Hm?! His stance changed?!
 8 Trigrams.
 128 Palms!
 HeΓÇÖs fast! The number of strikes has doubledΓÇª!
 If I get nailed by that straight on, it'll be the end for me.
 If thatΓÇÖs the case on his end,
 then itΓÇÖll be a battle of numbers on this end, too!
 The numberΓÇÖs too great! I wonΓÇÖt have enough time!
 The RotationΓÇÖs no good, just as I thoughtΓÇª
 It seems he has 360-degree vision.
 And it seems he deals with enemy attacks
 by combining his X-ray vision ability for seeing through things
 and his telescopic vision ability for long-distance sight.
 Furthermore, although heΓÇÖs got 360-degree vision,
 that vision has a formidable extentΓÇª
 If I were to determine the range from his reaction beforeΓÇª
 he almost unfailingly detected the Kunai Knives
 that entered the approximately 150-foot circumference around him.
 But for some reason,
 there are Kunai Knives he canΓÇÖt evade completely.
 If soΓÇª
 8 Trigrams, SixtyΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 This time, thereΓÇÖll be even more.
 This time, two will hitΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve found a way to impeccably assault your ability!
 It seems that defense technique
 was something to compensate for this weak point!
 In other words... Your Visual Jutsu isnΓÇÖt perfect!
 Why even bother?! IΓÇÖve won the game!
 Come on. Are you going to keep at it for naught?
 The fate of the small fry character in an easy game is to be destroyed right away!
 You canΓÇÖt beat me!
 ΓÇô I-IΓÇÖm not done yet. ΓÇô LeeΓÇª
 You never give up do you?
 No way you can beat him. HeΓÇÖs a genius unlike you.
 Genius? What is genius anyway!
 Even without any talent, IΓÇÖll surpass ΓÇ£geniusΓÇ¥ by working hard.
 ItΓÇÖs no use, Lee.
 No matter how hard you work, you cannot beat me.
 ItΓÇÖs already decided.
 Lady Hinata...
 YouΓÇÖre the sheltered little baby of the main branch.
 A person can never change.
 And then, this matchΓÇª
 Your destiny was decided at the point when I became your opponent.
 You donΓÇÖt know until you try!
 This is the endΓÇª
 Gentle Fist!
 Small fry character oneΓÇª Destruction completed.
 Well, for a crummy game, I was entertainedΓÇª
 HehΓÇª I missed the fatal spots, huh?
 And he wouldnΓÇÖt easily die from Kunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh?
 I seeΓÇª HeΓÇÖs still going to entertain me, huh?
 This is thanks for that.
 Seriously, that fat Jirobo canΓÇÖt be helped,
 but whatΓÇÖs that clod Kidomaru doing anywayΓÇª?
 That lowlife!
 HeΓÇÖs got the habit of playing games.

 When that idiot plays too much,
 he becomes hyper and easily gets into that stateΓÇª
 But still... Once he gets to the second stateΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs instant death for the opponent.
 Maximum destructive powerΓÇª with 100% accuracy!
 Die!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak

 For the first time, I spoke to you
 He doesnΓÇÖt carry out wasteful attacks.
 And he accurately reads information from the results.
 No mistake, this guyΓÇÖs the strongest of all IΓÇÖve fought up until now!
 I probably wonΓÇÖt be able to evade the next attack.
 IΓÇÖve had enough. I canΓÇÖt dodge it anyway.
 Since the secret of my eyes has been discovered, I wonΓÇÖt run or hide!

196,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 So itΓÇÖs a case of not being able to fight with the leader
 unless I defeat the underlings?
 Well then!
 Hot-Blooded Confrontation: Student vs. Sensei
 So you think youΓÇÖve blackened the path to this Might GuyΓÇÖs tomorrow with this?
 Youth is breaking through the walls that close you inΓÇª
 If you have both passion and effort,  then nothing is impossible!
 With our sights trained on tomorrowΓÇª!
 Is there no tomorrow for usΓÇª?
 So this wood retains its incredible strength
 because it is reinforced and connected by Chakra, I see.
 Guy SenseiΓÇª
 Yagura?
 Are you all right?!
 IΓÇÖm not YaguraΓÇª
 Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers,  Gensho!
 Second son of the same, Rokkaku!
 Third son, Jako!
 Ryudouin?
 HmmΓÇª I think IΓÇÖve heard of that somewhereΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt tell me that you donΓÇÖt remember!
 Our father, Agira Ryudouin, was deeply injured
 by the cowardly strategies of you Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
 And unable to execute his missions, he passed away in despair.
 Our father resented you to the very end,
 even muttering your name on his deathbedΓÇª
 telling us to fight with Might Guy of Hidden Leaf Village.
 From that day forth,
 our objective has been to avenge his death!
 Yes! We have been lying in wait for the time when we could get even with you!
 Oh! Do you mean that Agira?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way I could forget that battle.
 Although we were enemies on our missions, Agira was a fine manΓÇª
 That will remain in my memory as a splendid contest, even within
 the annals of the complete eight-volume
 ΓÇ£Might GuyΓÇÖs History of Famous Battles.ΓÇ¥
 It was a man-to-man fight.
 Nothing happened that dishonored my Way of Ninja!
 You three must be mistaken.
 I wonΓÇÖt be angry at you, so let me out of here!
 Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon  you to settle my fatherΓÇÖs scoreΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll finish you off!
 SakuraΓÇª
 I noticed you were there some time ago.
 My master told me to make sure you donΓÇÖt overdo it.
 YouΓÇÖre hiding something, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 N-NoΓÇª Nothing!
 Sakura, youΓÇÖre not very good at lyingΓÇª
 What?
 Die, Might Guy! Enemy of our father!
 Wait, I tell you!
 Hey, you Yagura imposter. lnfiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves,
 what are you scheming?!
 Byakugan!
 Guy is in that building! The building is controlled by their Chakra!
 Why you--!
 Intense Brow Sensei, IΓÇÖm coming to your rescue!
 Wh-What is this?!
 Do you intend to shut us in with these pieces of wood?
 DonΓÇÖt underestimate us!
 Stop it, Naruto!
 Wooden Dummies for training?
 Are these also controlled by those three?
 However strong they are,
 they couldnΓÇÖt move all of these Wooden Dummies at once.
 ItΓÇÖs hard to believe those three would have that much power.
 Byakugan!
 I see.
 They have a simple mechanism,
 and their movements are controlled by the labels stuck to the back of their heads.
 So, theyΓÇÖre not moved with Puppet Jutsu?
 No, theyΓÇÖre only designed for repeated punches and kicks,
 so they probably cannot respond to our movements!
 Does this mean their movements can be halted by removing the labels?
 So thatΓÇÖs what itΓÇÖs all about!
 If thatΓÇÖs the case, then IΓÇÖll return that blow!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here goes!
 Once I know the weak spot, youΓÇÖre all mine!
 ΓÇô Gotcha! 					ΓÇô Gotcha!
 Hah! This is easy!
 These Wooden Dummies are just one small part of our Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Wooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu!
 Damn you!
 Keep your wits about you!
 ThereΓÇÖs one that moves differently  from the others!
 Neji!
 U-zu-ma-kiΓÇª
 Naruto Barra--!
 Stay back!
 Some of these Wooden Dummies seem to be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu.
 Be careful!
 ΓÇô Lee! 					ΓÇô Bushy Brow!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Lee?!
 How did you know we were here?!
 From what Sakura told us,
 I felt certain that Guy Sensei would take this route
 if he were headed for the Land of Mountain Streams.
 And where is Guy Sensei?
 Inside there.
 What?
 A-Are they running away?
 WhatΓÇÖs happening?!
 ItΓÇÖs just like a castle!
 Leave this to me!
 Guy Sensei is my master! I would risk my life to save him!
 But, Bushy Brow, your leg injury hasnΓÇÖt healed yet.
 IΓÇÖm going in!
 ItΓÇÖs reckless!
 Do you intend to interfere?
 Today, I am just a bit different from usual--!
 Bushy Brow, weΓÇÖll cover you.
 There is a weak point in the Chakra at the center of the castle.
 If you hit there, thenΓÇª
 But it may be a trap!
 EveryoneΓÇª If it is a trap,  letΓÇÖs try falling into it intentionally.
 Over there!
 Dynamic Entry!
 As we suspected, it was a trap to lure me in.
 Anyway, letΓÇÖs follow it through.
 Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me.
 All right.
 Take revenge on that coward by a suitable method.
 Leave it to meΓÇª
 Wooden Dummy: Possess: Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
 A Wooden Dummy here too?
 Your teacher is an incredible liar, LeeΓÇª
 Is that YaguraΓÇÖs voice I hear?
 IΓÇÖll teach you both, master and student,
 that sometimes passion and effort alone come to naught.
 I wonΓÇÖt allow you to speak ill of my teacher.
 If youΓÇÖve got something to say,
 then why donΓÇÖt you come out here and say it?
 There is no need.
 I can amply prove it with  the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation.
 I have come to rescue my teacher!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖm going to let myself lose to you!
 You make me laughΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs this? The Leaf HurricaneΓÇª?
 Does this mean that the technique  I deployed that time
 has been completely imitated and mastered by Yagura?!
 In that caseΓÇª
 Leaf's Severe Hurricane!
 Can this really be Yagura?
 If heΓÇÖs mastered not only offensive moves,
 but also learned to guard with such perfection
 then he truly must be a genius!
 What an incredibly powerful spinning kickΓÇª
 The Gensho I faced off with in the practice hall
 did not have this much power.
 To my knowledge,
 there is only one person who could let loose this powerful a kick.
 They are student and teacher who respect each other.
 Dying in fighting each other must  be a wish come true.
 WeΓÇÖll have them crush each other
 with Wooden Dummies mimicking each otherΓÇÖs movements.
 Even if each were to discover the true identity of his opponentΓÇª
 They canΓÇÖt escape from the confrontation
 without defeating the Wooden Dummies before their eyes.
 That is the secret of
 Wooden Dummy: Possess: Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
 Looks like my legs canΓÇÖt last for very longΓÇª
 If it comes to this, thereΓÇÖs only one move left.
 Guy Sensei, itΓÇÖs okay right?
 If I use it for your sake, youΓÇÖll probably forgive me.
 The Lotus?
 Could it be that the one who is controlling  this Wooden Dummy is Lee?
 Dancing Leaf Shadow!
 A combo move from the Lotus Hit Back to aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
 ItΓÇÖs magnificentΓÇª Too magnificent!
 Only Guy Sensei could use such artful techniques!
 Splendid! If I had not been his opponent,
 IΓÇÖm 100% certain that he would have toppled the opponent with that Lotus.
 But, at this rate,  I wonΓÇÖt be able to beat this JutsuΓÇª
 Wait! There is a way.
 That tapping is Morse Code. ΓÇ£You and I are destroying each otherΓÇªΓÇ¥
 But thereΓÇÖs no way for either of us to end this fight
 without defeating the enemyΓÇÖs JutsuΓÇª
 So, it was Guy Sensei that  I was fighting all along?
 We must both create an attack  with speed and power
 of a magnitude that cannot be  reproduced by the Wooden DummiesΓÇª
 ΓÇ£But I cannot show to you  the abyss of death again!ΓÇ¥
 Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person  who is most important to meΓÇª
 ΓÇ£You will forgive me for using  that move, wonΓÇÖt you?
 ""To meΓÇª"" 					""To meΓÇª""
 ΓÇ£To me, there is no one more important than Guy Sensei,ΓÇ¥ you say?
 Lee! What do you mean by making me cry at a time like this?
 Lee! I havenΓÇÖt forgotten the promise I made to you back then!
 ΓÇ£If you dieΓÇªI shall die with you.ΓÇ¥
 Thank you, Guy Sensei!
 Now is the very time whenΓÇª
 oneΓÇÖs own Way of NinjaΓÇª
 ΓÇô must be followed to the very end!  ΓÇô must be followed to the very end!
 Third Gate: Gate of LifeΓÇª Open!
 Fourth Gate: Gate of PainΓÇª Open!
 Guy Sensei!
 WeΓÇÖre far from finished!
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, Elder Brother?
 TheyΓÇÖre fast. TheyΓÇÖre both too fastΓÇª
 At this rate, the Wooden Dummies willΓÇªbreak.
 Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing!
 Open!
 I canΓÇÖt see them. TheyΓÇÖre faster even than sound!
 There you go, Lee!
 Bring the Chakra of your passions  to bear upon your opponent!
 Right!
 ΓÇô The castle isΓÇª ΓÇô ΓÇªcrumbling?
 If this was revenge,
 then why did you not come at me with the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin?
 That day, though he was the only man left,
 your father refused to surrender,
 but fairly and sportingly confronted me with Kung Fu.
 Out of respect to your father, I faced him one to one.
 When the fight was finished, your father smiled slightly,
 as if satisfied, and said he would like to fight againΓÇª
 Whether or not you believe me, this is all there was to it.
 Could it be that what Father wanted to say
 was not that he wanted us to defeat Master Guy,
 but that he wanted to fight again, fairly and squarely?
 Have we had the wrong idea all along?
 I learned something important from your father in that fight.
 It is not the people born with  natural gifts who are the lucky ones;
 the truly fortunate are they who,  believing in themselves to the very end,
 can go on striving and keep the flame of their passions alive because of it.
 Uh-huh. ThatΓÇÖs a good teacher-student relationship.
 Naruto!
 Say, Sakura! Hurry up and get Bushy Brow to GrandmaΓÇÖs place, will you?
 Got it! Get him to the stretcher.
 No, donΓÇÖt worry about me. IΓÇÖm okay. See to Yagura first.
 Speaking of which, I still havenΓÇÖt asked of YaguraΓÇÖs real name.
 Lee, thereΓÇÖll be plenty of tim  for that later.
 Administering first-aid should take priority.
 Yes! Guy Sensei!
 Yup, yupΓÇª That is really one super teacher-student relationship.
 I wish mine was as goodΓÇª

 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªthe mediumΓÇª?
 To thank you for entertaining me up to nowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll show you the real powerΓÇª
 of the Sand Spirit!
 The circles under his eyesΓÇª
 Those are symptoms of insomnia which indicate
 that the medium is also possessed by the Shukaku of the Sand.
 InsomniaΓÇª?
 Those who are possessed by the Demon Raccoon Shukaku
 are unable to sleep soundly through the entire night.
 Because of the terrorΓÇª
 If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowly eat away at their personality
 and eventually that person is no longer himself.
 Because he normally doesnΓÇÖt get much sleepΓÇª
 the mediumΓÇÖs personality tends toΓÇªbecome unstable.
 OhΓÇª
 Therefore, usually while the medium is awake,
 the power of Shukaku is normally controlled.
 HoweverΓÇª
 when that medium sleepsΓÇª

 Water Style: Water Bullets!

 Chief! I told you, not in that direction!
 Shut up! I know!
 Air Bullets!
 Water Bullets!
 Too badΓÇª
 This isnΓÇÖt good, Chief! There's one shot leftΓÇª!
 Yeah! I killed itΓÇª
 I killed it!
 That hurtsΓÇª!
 How dare you shoot me
 with bullets containing stupid amounts of Chakra!
 Even I canΓÇÖt take that many shots!
 What should we do?!
 For a start, wake up that medium kid!
 It will release that Jutsu!
 How do we go about waking him?!
 Give him a good punch!
 Water Bullets!
 Like IΓÇÖll take that!
 Now!
 Chief, I canΓÇÖt hit him unless you hold him down!
 This Toad doesnΓÇÖt have fangs or claws to hold that guyΓÇÖs movement.
 What should we do then?!
 WeΓÇÖll use the Transform Jutsu to change into something that has those!
 But with that saidΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not particularly good at transformations.
 Huh?
 So you will act as my will and make the Sign!
 Whaaaat?!
 Time for a combined transformation!
 UhΓÇªOkay!
 We got to have fangs and claws!
 UmmΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 WaitΓÇª Say, w-wait a secondΓÇª!
 F- Fangs and clawsΓÇª Fangs and clawsΓÇª Fangs and claws!
 Transform!
 Transform Jutsu!

 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 I donΓÇÖt know about your past, and my past doesnΓÇÖt matter either!
 I only have people who I must protect.
 Hey you with no eyebrows!
 LetΓÇÖs just end this as similar fighters.
 I will finish this with my next hit.

 HuhΓÇª
 Jiraiya: Naruto's Potential Disaster
 Atafuku Town? ThatΓÇÖs ten kilometers from here!
 ItΓÇÖs ΓÇ£OΓÇ¥tafuku Town!
 HeyΓÇªheyΓÇª 					Hey, Pervy Sage!
 IΓÇÖm telling you, itΓÇÖs Jiraiya. Gimme a breakΓÇª
 So the fact that such a bigwig Pervy Sage like you
 is taking me along as his travel companion meansΓÇª
 that IΓÇÖm potentially a genius?
 Just as I thought!
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Why did you choose me?
 A long time ago, the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.
 And you resemble the Fourth Hokage so much, itΓÇÖs almost funny.
 ThatΓÇÖs the only reasonΓÇª
 IΓÇª?
 The Fourth HokageΓÇª?
 Yeah!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 W-What is it?
 Yeah!
 The fact that I resemble the Fourth Hokage means
 that I also possess genius of his level, right?
 IΓÇÖll become the Hokage, after all! All right!
 W-WaitΓÇª
 I stepped on some dog poop!
 About the only areas you resemble the Fourth Hokage
 are your hair and your stubbornness!
 What was that?! You senile Pervy Sage!
 Not again!
 Sakura? Come here!
 Okay!
 Please take these rice sweets over to InoΓÇÖs house.
 InoΓÇÖs house?
 These?
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt bother them by staying too long.
 Because everyone is very busy at this time.
 I know that!
 See you later!
 Oh, yeahΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll bring some over to Sasuke later on too.
 I wonder if he likes sweetsΓÇª?
 And to Naruto tooΓÇª
 Naruto looks like he would eat anythingΓÇª
 Hey Kakashi Sensei! Teach me Chidori too!
 You may say teach me, but itΓÇÖs not that easy.
 What the heckΓÇÖs that?!
 ThatΓÇÖs not fair, show me how! Teach it to me.
 SasukeΓÇª Thank youΓÇª
 You rescued me from the Sand Ninja, right?
 NoΓÇª
 Huh?
 For a start, why donΓÇÖt you try gathering Chakra in your palms!
 All right!
 The person who rescued youΓÇª was Naruto.
 Like this? Like this?
 Oh come on, Sasuke, youΓÇÖre being overmodest again.
 ItΓÇÖs true that Naruto has gotten stronger, but against that Sand NinjaΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm telling you the truth.
 That kid fought desperately to rescue you.
 He showed a kind of strength that he had never shown before.
 Naruto rescuedΓÇªme.
 Oh, itΓÇÖs comingΓÇª
 Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!
 All right! IΓÇÖll bring some to Naruto too!
 I wasnΓÇÖtΓÇª I wasnΓÇÖt able to do anythingΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt want to watch a precious comrade die right before my eyes ever againΓÇª
 No matter what, I will protect you!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.
 Compared to him, IΓÇª
 While you may able to manage against him,
 I couldnΓÇÖt possiblyΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs in a completely different levelΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª
 If we go at each other, weΓÇÖll either both be killed or at best,
 kill each other simultaneously.
 Even if we increased the numbers, that wouldnΓÇÖt change.
 I didnΓÇÖt expect the kidΓÇÖs guard would be a legendary Sannin.
 With him as the opponentΓÇª
 the names of Leaf VillageΓÇÖs Uchiha Clan
 and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of Mist would be tarnished.
 Yeah. HoweverΓÇª
 Any strong one has a weaknessΓÇª
 Stop! You will get cursed!
 Hey, hey, Pervy SageΓÇª
 Huh?!
 What kind of a student was the Fourth Hokage?
 Well, I guess one could say
 that he developed to that extent because he was my studentΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre one lucky guy to be taught by me!
 ΓÇô HmmmΓÇª 					ΓÇô HmmmΓÇª
 Are you dubious?
 A good teacher will develop good disciples.
 That goes without saying.
 Then, then, who taught you, Pervy Sage?
 Me?
 I learned from the Third Hokage.
 The Third Hokage?
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 The Third Hokage was still young and lively.
 ΓÇô The Third HokageΓÇªyoung and lively? ΓÇô The Third HokageΓÇªyoung and lively?
 ThatΓÇÖs right! I was young and lively too!
 Young and lively?!
 IΓÇªI got tangled up.
 SeeΓÇª You got cursedΓÇª
 So you learned from Kakashi.
 Then you experienced the ΓÇ£Bell Training,ΓÇ¥ right?
 HuhΓÇª?
 Yeah! I did! Yes I did!
 Only I was tied to the tree trunk and had one deuce of a timeΓÇª
 What? You too?
 Huh? What do you mean by ΓÇ£you tooΓÇ¥?
 Huh?
 What do you mean by ΓÇ£you tooΓÇ¥?
 Why donΓÇÖt you just hurry, get up and return those things.
 Even if you were to say thatΓÇª itΓÇÖs pretty difficultΓÇª
 There are two bells.
 The fact that there are only two meansΓÇª
 That one of us has to go to the tree trunkΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.
 All right! IΓÇÖll make it!
 Come at me with the intent to kill!
 Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didnΓÇÖt I?
 You got tied to the tree trunk, after all.
 Shut up!
 You flat-chested like a cutting board.
 What did you say?! You nerdy perv!
 Okay, Okay, thatΓÇÖs enough.
 Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
 Okay!
 You are hopelessΓÇª
 Ninja shouldnΓÇÖt be getting caught in obvious traps like that over and over again.
 ButΓÇª
 Why donΓÇÖt you learn a little from Orochimaru?!
 Sarutobi Sensei, youΓÇÖre always saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!
 Hm?
 When it comes to snooping, IΓÇÖm really good at Transparency Jutsu.
 Gimme a breakΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt even wanna know
 what level of Transparency Jutsu you possessΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve never been caught once! And thatΓÇÖs the truth!
 If youΓÇÖre that sure of yourself, IΓÇÖll go with you next timeΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre such a lecher, Sarutobi SenseiΓÇª
 Huh?! Huh?
 What, what?
 Hey!
 WhatΓÇÖs so funny?! Pervy Sage!
 Huh?
 ItΓÇÖs just as I said, a good teacher will develop good disciples.
 HuhΓÇª? I donΓÇÖt understand what youΓÇÖre saying!
 Come on, letΓÇÖs go. Did you put it back properly?
 Yeah, I fixed them!
 See!
 It appears that they havenΓÇÖt found Naruto yet.
 But donΓÇÖt you think thatΓÇÖs strange?
 Those guys had already infiltrated the village.
 It should be easy to find Naruto in this village.
 Itachi knows NarutoΓÇÖs face.
 KakashiΓÇª
 Why is Kakashi sleeping?
 Besides, only Jonin are gathering hereΓÇª
 What are you doing? What in the world happened?!
 NothingΓÇªin particularΓÇª
 Is it true that that ltachi has returned?!
 And moreover, that heΓÇÖs after NarutoΓÇª?!
 OhΓÇª
 IdiotΓÇª
 Why does this always happen?!
 So that guy returned to this village? And moreover, heΓÇÖs pursuing Naruto?
 What does all this mean?!
 Sasuke?!
 WhereΓÇÖs Naruto?!
 Huh? I just got here too.
 I wanted to give NarutoΓÇª
 Some sweetsΓÇª?
 If Naruto is caught by that guy, that will spell his end.
 IΓÇÖm not gonna let him do that!
 Hey old man! Naruto must have come here!
 And do you know where he went after that?
 Oh, Naruto, rightΓÇª
 If I remember correctlyΓÇª
 Master Jiraiya came here around noon andΓÇª
 They ate ramen together, and he said he was going somewhereΓÇª
 Where?!
 HmmΓÇªI think he said to a post station some distance from the villageΓÇª
 And then he left with Master Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya?
 Jiraiya ΓÇô one of the genius Sannin.
 Well, in appearance,
 he just looks like a big white-haired old man.
 Big and white-hairedΓÇª
 H-Hey!
 GeezΓÇª If youΓÇÖre gonna ask somebody a question,
 itΓÇÖs only polite to stay and have a ramen or something.
 Candies are here.
 This town is pretty weird.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 WeΓÇÖre staying here tonight!
 What?! I can still walk!
 A disciple should obey his master!
 I just want to learn the Jutsu!
 ThatΓÇÖs whatΓÇÖs called a disciple!
 Huh?!
 Oh, ohΓÇª!
 Naruto!
 Yes?
 Here, this is the key to the room.
 Go to the room ahead of me, practice Chakra,
 train some and go to sleep!
 Got it?!
 What?!
 ΓÇ£The adult world is gonna begin from this point onΓÇ¥ΓÇª
 Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?! ThatΓÇÖs not fair!
 That post town isnΓÇÖt that farΓÇª!
 This! Somehow this always happens when IΓÇÖm with that Pervy Sage!
 DarnΓÇª
 HereΓÇª
 Candies are here!
 IΓÇÖve got to check door by door!
 Cheers!
 I wonder if he really has any inclination to oversee my training?
 What about that one? Yeah that.
 See! A hundred out of a hundred!
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 This is an inn for women onlyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm looking for someoneΓÇª
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 Today, we only have old people.
 HmmΓÇªthis is kind of crisp on the tongueΓÇª
 Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 White-hairedΓÇª?
 Are they here?!
 EhΓÇªDo I remember seeing some people like that earlier
 when shifts changedΓÇª?
 This tastes bitterΓÇª are you all right with it? Cheers!
 Oh! A blond kid and a white-haired old man!
 TheyΓÇÖre here?! WhatΓÇÖs their room number!
 UmΓÇª
 Room number one at the end of the hallway
 on the second floorΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs up? Has she already dumped you?
 Okay, Okay!
 Okay, Okay, IΓÇÖll open up!
 Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs not himΓÇª
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Darn it! My body is frozen! What is this creepy feeling?
 This guy is absolutely not an ordinary person.
 HeΓÇÖs got the same Sharingan as Sasuke.
 HeΓÇÖs a member of Uchiha clan.
 Is this the guy Sasuke was talking about?

 Okay! Okay!
 There it is! ThatΓÇÖs it!
 ButΓÇª
 A teacup like this a treasure, huhΓÇª?
 A delivery mission?
 No, itΓÇÖs delivery protection to be exact.
 ThereΓÇÖs a higher risk of danger than a regular delivery.
 The Beauty of Nature is a treasure of national importance so to speak.
 In monetary value, you could buy one or two mountains with its value.
 For realΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖd like you to deliver it safely to Kale Avenue
 where it will be put on exhibition.
 At any rate, whatΓÇÖs with that humongous safeΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖre late.

 Huh?
 CanΓÇÖt you see the ΓÇ£no trespassingΓÇ¥ sign, huh?!
 No, we came here on a delivery mission from Lady Tsunade for that thing.

 HuhΓÇª?
 Look out. ltΓÇÖs going to fall!
 Run, Naruto!
 Hey, whatΓÇÖre you doing, bro?

 All right!
 That was closeΓÇª
 S-So what should we do with this, bro?
 Die.
 You jerkΓÇª
 As for you brother, what kind of person are you?!
 We were just about to die!
 Huh?
 Ninja are supposed to risk their lives on a commissioned mission, right?
 Just a minute, buddy!
 IΓÇÖm not your buddy!

 Jeez. Getting all uselessly carried away.
 YouΓÇÖll get no sympathy if you get all tired later on!
 This here is not like you guys, this here!
 So you got too carried away and dropped it?

 JeezΓÇª Well, weΓÇÖve got the time,

 NoΓÇª It seems we donΓÇÖt have that much time.

 Oh! The Beauty of Nature!
 DonΓÇÖt move, buddy! Gently, hold out your hand!
 Idiot, whatΓÇÖre you doing?!

 the Beauty of Nature rather than my life!

 Yeah, do as you like!

 Now then, what shall I do now?
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 Sure enoughΓÇª without the treasureΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt mope like that. ThatΓÇÖs why you guys are useless.
 But thereΓÇÖs no point without the treasure after all!
 Huh? If there isnΓÇÖt one, then I just have to make one.
 MakeΓÇª? You say that like itΓÇÖs easy, butΓÇª.
 ThatΓÇÖs a picture of you, buddy.
 The creator of the dauntless artifactΓÇª
 Beauty of Nature ΓÇª Shinemon, the living national treasure?
 So basicallyΓÇª?
 That means you made the Beauty of Nature, buddy?!
 But, youΓÇÖreΓÇªthe clientΓÇª
 You got a problem
 with the client being the creator and a living national treasure?
 But no matter how you look at itΓÇª
 This hereΓÇÖs not like you guys! This here!
 Well, you knowΓÇª
 It means my life rather than the treasure was the correct answer.
 You do pretty good work for Genin.
 Thanks for the help.
 Now then, I guess IΓÇÖll hurry
 and make a masterpiece to exceed the Beauty of Nature!

 WhatΓÇÖs a Ninja Dropout?
 ItΓÇÖs a gang of thieves consisting of Rogue Ninja,

 I canΓÇÖt forgive them for using their Shinobi powers for evil.
 So, well, you can figure out the rest by now.
 In other words, there is a possibility that they will

 Exactly.

 And that time, I thought of myself that IΓÇª no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it was the most painful thing.
 That IΓÇª that my existence didnΓÇÖt matter to anyone else in the world.
 D-DonΓÇÖt come any closer!
 The pain ofΓÇªbeing all aloneΓÇª really is unbearable, isnΓÇÖt it?
 The way you feelΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know why, but I completely understand that it hurts.
 But IΓÇÖve met people who are very important to me now.
 I wonΓÇÖt allow those important peopleΓÇª to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you even if that meansΓÇªthat I have to kill you!
 WhyΓÇª?
 How is it that you can fight so much for other people?
 They saved me from the hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I was.
 ThatΓÇÖs whyΓÇªthey are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that personΓÇª
 LoveΓÇª
 That is why he is so strong?
 ThatΓÇÖs enough, NarutoΓÇª
 Sakura is okay.
 This guyΓÇÖs Chakra must have been depleted as wellΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇÖs sand crumbled a long time ago.
 Oh, I seeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve had enoughΓÇª Stop here.
 Gaara?
 IΓÇÖve never seen Gaara in such a weakened state beforeΓÇª
 All right.
 Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
 LOVE 							One of these days, even IΓÇª
 TemariΓÇª KankuroΓÇª
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 SorryΓÇª
 D-DonΓÇÖt worry about itΓÇª
 RainΓÇª
 The sky has started to weep as wellΓÇª
 We will begin the memorial service
 for the Third Hokage, who lost his life in this battle,
 as well as the other victims of this battle.
 ItΓÇÖs startedΓÇª
 In the end, all we could do was just watchΓÇª
 Why?
 Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
 WhyΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs already been a yearΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not easy to laugh hiding your sadness.
 I heard from your teacher that youΓÇÖre the center of laughterΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not sad at all!
 ItΓÇÖs a very honorable thing for a Shinobi to die doing their duty!
 My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
 to protect this village from the Demon FoxΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖre heroes!
 I am the child of the heroes! IΓÇÖm not sad to be alone.
 And besides, these are tears of joy.
 ItΓÇÖs all right.
 I know that youΓÇÖre curled up holding your knees by yourself.
 But youΓÇÖre not aloneΓÇª
 Huh?
 The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village have the will of fireΓÇª
 Will of fireΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs the strong will to protect the Leaf Village.
 As long as they have this will of fire, everybody in this village are all family.
 IrukaΓÇª I wonder if you have it?
 YeahΓÇª
 For HayateΓÇª?
 The Third HokageΓÇÖs funeral has already started. Make it quick.
 You too, Kakashi, is it for ObitoΓÇª?
 If youΓÇÖre always thinking of an excuse for your tardiness,
 you should just come earlier.
 I doΓÇªfrom early in the morning.
 ItΓÇÖs just that, whenever I come here
 I just want to punish myself for being such a fool in the past.
 HumphΓÇª
 Shinobi, no matter what kind of situation they are in,
 cannot show their emotion.
 You must always prioritize your mission,
 and never shed a tear in any kind of situationΓÇª
 Iruka SenseiΓÇª
 Hmm?
 Why do people risk their own lives for other people?
 When one person diesΓÇª
 their past, their present life, and their future disappear along with them.
 Many people die doing their duty and fighting in battleΓÇª
 And shockingly easily, too.
 Hayate was one of them.
 Those who pass away also have dreams and ambitions.
 But everyone has something else, just as important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, loversΓÇª Those who are dear to them.
 They trust each other and help each other,
 the people whom theyΓÇÖve cherished since the day they were born.
 And that string which connects those people
 becomes stronger and thicker as time goes byΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be explained by logicΓÇª
 Those who hold those strings just do it, because itΓÇÖs important to them.
 Yeah, I kind of get it.
 ButΓÇª
 It's tough to die.
 ItΓÇÖs not like he just died for nothing.
 He left us something very important.
 Well, youΓÇÖll eventually understand one of these days.
 Yeah, I kind of get that too!
 The rainΓÇÖs stopped.
 Bye! Iruka Sensei!
 YeahΓÇª
 Lord Third Hokage, the will of fire you spoke of
 seems to have been passed on to the young Leaves.
 The flame in their hearts which you lit
 will burn bright and strongΓÇª
 And it will shine upon this village, and watch over and protect us.
 It will become a new HokageΓÇª one of these daysΓÇª
 They did manage to avoid annihilation,
 but it seems the damage is pretty extensive.
 The village that was once at the height of its gloryΓÇª
 How sadΓÇª
 How unlike you.
 You have lingering affections for your old home?
 Even you?
 No, not at all.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 The ritual ends, and morning mist will be covering all soon.
 SilenceΓÇª
 In that white mist, the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.
 It awakens childhood memory, disappointment, ire, and resolve.
 The cog wheel named destiny slowly begins to turnΓÇª
 Next time: ΓÇ£Return of the Morning MistΓÇ¥

2,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Hey, you!
 Are you sure you want to look like that?
 Yes, of course! C'mon! So hurry hurry!
 Don't regret it later.
 Say cheese!
 My Name Is Konohamaru!
 I couldn't decide on how to look.
 It took me 3 hours to decide.
 But as you can see, it's more like a work of art.
 Doesn't it look great?
 Take it over.
 What?!
 Take it over.
 Stop saying that!
 Transform!
 Oh please, Lord HokageΓÇª
 The Sexy JutsuΓÇª That's quite a devious technique.
 By the way Naruto, where's your headband?
 I won't wear it until the orientation. lt might get scratched
 Well, that's just fine.
 But the Ninja Registration Form is a very important document
 held in high regard by our village.
 Why do you want to look like this?
 Because!
 Anyway, how should I know about all that stuff?
 Old man! Get ready to fight!
 I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!
 Ouch!
 If it's not one thing, it's anotherΓÇª.
 Drat! Is this a trap?
 Are you okay, Honorable Grandson?
 May I just inform you that there aren't any traps hereΓÇª
 Huh? What's with this runt?
 What?!
 I know this kidΓÇª He's that Nine-Tailed boy!
 He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!
 You must have done this to me!
 You tripped all by yourself, stupid!
 Hey! Let go of him!
 He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage!
 He stopped as soon as he learned who I amΓÇª.
 He's like my four-eyed teacher.
 He's just like everyone else!
 What's the matter?
 Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?
 Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?
 As if I care! 					lmbecile!
 This guyΓÇª
 What?!
 Good griefΓÇª
 Listen to me.
 You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage.
 Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind.
 Nothing good will come of your tangling with him.
 This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu,
 and I am never wrong about these things!
 Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage?
 Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu,
 so that your dream will become a reality.
 That's right.
 Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?
 He's gone!
 It seems he's gone after Naruto.
 Oh no!
 This is terrible!
 Honorable Grandson!
 How did he become like this?
 That was the 20th sneak attack today.
 And now he's in the company of Naruto. I'm a bit worried.
 I just hope he doesn't pick up more foolishness.
 Huh?
 Stop following me!
 What is it now?!
 Your camouflage is pathetic.
 You've seen through my disguise...
 Your reputation is well-earned.
 I will allow you to make me your apprentice.
 But you must first teach me that  ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique
 you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.
 You gotta be kidding.
 I beg you to say yes, boss!
 Huh?
 Boss?
 Boss! Boss! Boss!
 I guess I have no choice.
 Listen.
 In order to become a skilled Ninja,
 you must first learn to control your Chatora.
 Chatora?
 Yes, Chatora.
 Boss, I think you mean Chakra.
 Silence!
 That's what real Ninjas call it!
 Oh! I didn't know that!
 WhewΓÇª I'm glad he's a fool.
 Listen. Chakra essentially meansΓÇª
 Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu.
 Huh?
 In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra,
 the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body
 with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience.
 This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs.
 You made me think you knew all that,
 when you were just reading from a scroll!
 Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques,
 but it really boils down to just one thing.
 And what is that?
 Hard work and guts.
 Hard work and guts?
 That's right.
 So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you.
 Yes, boss!
 Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me.
 Huh?
 Let me see first how much you already know.
 But what do I transform into?
 OK... First, transform into that lady.
 An easy task, boss.
 Transform!
 Well, do I look like her?
 UhmΓÇª Well, the clothes do andΓÇª
 And what's so similar about that?!
 Honorable Grandson.
 If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK?
 She's scary!
 Why am I the one who gets hit?
 OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!
 Yes, boss!
 I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto!
 This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it!
 Yes, boss!
 Transform!
 Naruto! It's you again!
 Why is it always meΓÇª?
 Sorry.
 Huh?
 It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson.
 Don't worry about it.
 Huh?
 You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu!
 You just need more practice.
 Yes, boss!
 OK, keep in mindΓÇª the point is for ""boom boom boom""!
 Now do it!
 Yes, boss! 					Transform!
 What do you think?
 That won't do!
 More slender.
 Yes, boss!
 Is this okay?
 Not yet. 					More attractive.
 Yes, boss!
 How about now?
 That NarutoΓÇª What is he teaching the Honorable GrandsonΓÇª?
 Where the hell could they beΓÇª?
 I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage.
 All those who interfere will be eliminated.
 You know I've been wonderingΓÇª
 You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage.
 My name is Konohamaru.
 It was Grandpa who gave me that name.
 He named me after our village.
 It should be easy for everyone here to remember.
 But nobody ever calls me by that name.
 When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage.
 No one sees me for who I really am.
 I can't stand it anymore.
 That's whyΓÇª
 That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now.
 IdiotΓÇªWho do you think will accept you, huh?
 Huh?
 You won't win the title that easily, you know.
 What?!
 It's not that simple.
 If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord HokageΓÇª
 What?
 You'll have to beat me first!
 Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you.
 Iruka.
 Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form?
 Yes.
 When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand,
 he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja.
 He's been happy since then.
 It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream.
 Huh?
 As you well know,
 only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago
 know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto.
 I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident.
 I have severely punished those who have broken this rule.
 Now our children know nothing about it.
 That is the only positive development for Naruto.
 Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died,
 his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.
 A hero?
 The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby
 whose umbilical cord had just been cut.
 As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 Naruto saved the village.
 Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that.
 Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.
 Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children.
 Iruka. 					Do you know?
 What, sir?
 When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence,
 he sees it in the eyes of the people around him.
 I have found you!
 Huh?
 That Demon Fox!!
 That cold look! lt's always like that!
 Honorable Grandson, we have to go now.
 No way!
 I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!
 Don't get in my way!
 A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,
 judgment, obedience and all that.
 He must be skilled at more than thousand techniquesΓÇª
 And then...
 Transform!
 Take this! Sexy Jutsu!
 What? 					lt didn't work!
 What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!
 I am a gentleman!
 Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!
 Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!
 Stick with me and...
 you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 C'mon, let's go!
 No way!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu
 Wow! 					Fantastic!
 Ha! 					That's nothing.
 I am a distinguished teacher.
 I am not as weak as Mizuki.
 BossΓÇª
 Transform!
 Transform!
 Oh, Master EbisuΓÇª
 I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""!
 He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.
 That's another devious attack.
 I probably won't even survive that one.
 I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!
 I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!
 But I keep failing.
 You think it's that easy?
 Huh?
 It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.
 Everybody must learn to believe in you.
 I've been through a lot already.
 It's been one struggle after another.
 But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.
 I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.
 You had better push yourself.
 For what?
 The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.
 There's no such thing as a shortcut.
 If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage
 You'll have to beat me first.
 Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?
 I won't be your apprentice anymore.
 From now on, you're my rival.
 Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.
 Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.
 Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.
 You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.
 Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?
 The guy I hate the most?
 Sakura keeps saying  ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!""
 and doesn't even pay attention to me!
 It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!
 I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura!
 Next Episode:  ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?""
 Watch my outstanding performance!

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions

 Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is all about Passion!
 ItΓÇÖs been a while, hasnΓÇÖt it, Naruto? Were you alone on a mission this time?
 I just went to deliver Grandma TsunadeΓÇÖs letterΓÇª
 Is that so? Then you should report to Lady Tsunade right away.
 I know!
 IΓÇÖve only been away for a week,
 but it seems as though an awful lot has changed.
 DOJO CHALLENGERS, COME THIS WAY 		That sign wasnΓÇÖt here before, either.
 Dojo challenge?
 MAKE-OUT VIOLENCE 3
 This way?
 This is a tight squeeze.
 Is that it?
 PASSION DOJO 		ΓÇ£Passion Dojo."" 		Who on earth built this?
 IΓÇÖve been waiting for you!
 Huh?
 YouΓÇÖve come here for a Dojo challenge, right?
 Well, then. Come at me from anywhere you like!
 Huh? Bushy Brow?
 If you donΓÇÖt make a move, IΓÇÖm coming at you!
 What? Wait, hold it.
 Hey, itΓÇÖs me! ltΓÇÖs only me, Bushy Brow!
 Naruto!
 Hey, that was close, I tell you!
 So the first Dojo challenger will be you, Naruto!
 Well, I couldnΓÇÖt wish for a better opponent!
 Huh?
 IΓÇÖm going to go at this for real!
 W-Wait just a minute!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 HereΓÇª
 So you just came to view the grounds?
 Then you should have said so in the first place.
 I never even got a chance to tell you. You just suddenly attacked me.
 IΓÇÖm really sorry about that.
 Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow?
 Yes. I have been working on it for quite some time
 and finally completed it 6 days ago.
 This flyer was distributed not only in Hidden Leaf Village,
 but in all the nearby towns and villages as well.
 You donΓÇÖt say?
 IΓÇÖve been away on a mission and have only just returnedΓÇª
 Is that so?
 But why a Dojo?
 ItΓÇÖs all for training.
 For training?
 Well, actually, IΓÇÖve been busy with missions lately
 and have not been able to set aside as much time for training as IΓÇÖd like to.
 And even on those occasions when I was able to take time outΓÇª
 it was difficult to find practice partners, so I wasnΓÇÖt able to train efficiently.
 Just when I was wondering what I ought to do about it
 YOUTH 		I saw something in a village 		I visited on a missionΓÇª
 I request a challenge!
 Please come this way.
 OkayΓÇª
 I have traveled near and far in search of trainingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like to have a practice match.
 But if I should win, IΓÇÖll claim your marquee.
 A Dojo challenge, huh? Very well, I shall have a match with you.
 Here I come!
 If I were to open my own Dojo,
 someone with confidence in his skills will surely come to challenge me!
 So, I opened the Dojo thinking it would give me good practice,
 but nobody has come to challenge me yetΓÇª
 HmmmΓÇª Is that so?
 Say, since youΓÇÖre here, Naruto, wonΓÇÖt you try out for a Dojo challenge?
 If you win, IΓÇÖll give you the sign I painted myself.
 I have no need for such things.
 DonΓÇÖt say that! Please, by all means!
 C-Come to think of it, I forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade!
 IΓÇÖd better go right away!
 See you later!
 Naruto!
 Please be my first!
 Damn it. I wasted so much time thanks to Bushy Brow.
 Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits.
 IΓÇÖd better steer clear of Bushy BrowΓÇÖs Dojo for the time being.
 WhatΓÇÖs that I hear about LeeΓÇÖs Dojo?
 Intense Brow SenseiΓÇª?
 Naruto, what do you mean by that?
 Do you mean to tell me that he opened a Dojo to train himself
 while I was away from the village on a mission?
 Splendid, if I may say so about my own student!
 I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved!
 But the all-important Dojo challengers are yet to appearΓÇª Not a single one.
 Damn those Dojo challengers!
 To think that LeeΓÇÖs earnest hopes have come to naughtΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll search high and low and give them a hit they can not forget!
 But, if you do that,
 youΓÇÖll just make even less people want to visit for a challenge.
 Ah, thatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª Whatever shall I do then?!
 IΓÇÖve got it. If no one come to challenge his Dojo, thenΓÇª
 Why donΓÇÖt I myself go to LeeΓÇÖs Dojo, disguised as a Dojo challenger?
 IΓÇÖll play the part of LeeΓÇÖs first!
 A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself.
 He wouldnΓÇÖt dream that this was me, no way.
 Here I come, Lee.
 Guy Sensei!
 I finally found you.
 If it isnΓÇÖt Sakura! What is going on?
 Guy, forgive me for bothering you when youΓÇÖve only just returned, butΓÇª
 an emergency relief request has come in from ShikamaruΓÇÖs squad,
 which was assigned to transport unit duty.
 We know nothing whatsoever about the true nature and scale of the enemy.
 ThereforeΓÇª
 there is a possibility of this developing into something major
 if we err in our initial encounter.
 Judging from reports, they should be around here.
 TheyΓÇÖre close by.
 First, you go reconnoiter to confirm the situation.
 If they seem to need additional relief, I will make immediate arrangements.
 Yes, roger that.
 Can that strange getup have some significance?
 I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs with that strange fellow?
 Well, no matter. IΓÇÖll borrow his form
 to infiltrate Leaf Village.
 The Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇÖ secretsΓÇª
 I, Nanafushi, shall investigate every last detail!
 Was that guy really looking for a Dojo challenge?
 Yeah. ThatΓÇÖs what he claimed to be, so there can be no doubt.
 He says he came because he saw the flyers.
 I wonder if he got lost or somethingΓÇª
 Intense Brow Sensei, how long do you intend to keep us waiting?
 Naruto, I think, after all, IΓÇÖd like to have you be a Dojo challengerΓÇª
 Oh no.
 IΓÇÖll go look for him!
 Naruto!
 LetΓÇÖs work up a youthful sweat with me!
 Oh, he returned after all.
 I knew that get up would be problematic.
 What? 					WhatΓÇÖs the problem?
 Huh?
 SenseiΓÇª? WhatΓÇÖs with the strange disguise?
 Everyone can still tell itΓÇÖs you!
 IΓÇªI didnΓÇÖt think it was such a great idea, either.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 DonΓÇÖt tell me these guys have discovered my true identify!
 Intense Brow Sensei!
 Sensei!
 Oh!
 Quit lollygagging and get over to Lee's Dojo!
 Huh?!
 If you donΓÇÖt go, then IΓÇÖll have to fight him! Come on!
 Be seeing youΓÇª!
 I guess you could sayΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs typical of himΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm safe thanks to this guyΓÇª
 I should attach myself to him for a while and scope out the situation in the village.
 What is this place?
 This is LeeΓÇÖs Dojo!
 But, reallyΓÇª CouldnΓÇÖt you have come up with a little better disguise?
 Well, never mind!
 Lee must be tired of waiting, so try to do a good acting job!
 Acting? What is he talking about?
 IΓÇÖve brought him with me, Bushy Brow!
 IΓÇÖve been waiting for youΓÇª!
 Well then, please try to take down my Dojo!
 HuhΓÇª?
 Please come this way!
 UmΓÇªum.
 At time like this, you're supposed to say, ΓÇ£I request a challenge match,ΓÇ¥ right?
 I-I seeΓÇª
 I-I request a challenge match!
 Do I hear that familiar call? You indeed are a Dojo challenger!
 Fair enough! If you win, you can have my marquee!
 Could it be that IΓÇÖve been mistaken for a Dojo challenger?
 Oh my godΓÇª
 Huh?!
 HeΓÇÖs just a kidΓÇª
 Well, it canΓÇÖt be helped. IΓÇÖll go easy on himΓÇª
 Okay! Here I come!
 ΓÇô Ready! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 He disappeared?
 HuhΓÇª?
 Wh-What happenedΓÇª?
 This little bratΓÇª!
 Take that! And that! And this! And that!
 He's strong!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 I know youΓÇÖre only acting, but youΓÇÖre still giving him too much of a break, Sensei.
 Oh, I see. HeΓÇÖs not fighting back because itΓÇÖll ruin his disguise!
 Even if I had nine lives, IΓÇÖd never survive this fellowΓÇª
 I think IΓÇÖd better wave a white flag and withdraw here.
 I-I concedeΓÇª
 Then that meansΓÇªI did it!
 I splendidly fought off my first Dojo challenger!
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it at all!
 What he means by ΓÇ£concedeΓÇ¥
 is that he concedes to be a Dojo challenger, right?
 In other words, heΓÇÖs just been warming up,
 and now comes the real challenge, right?
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it at all!
 So that's what you meant, after allΓÇª
 I thought it was odd that
 that an experienced Dojo challenger would surrender.
 ItΓÇÖs not odd! ThereΓÇÖs nothing odd about it at all!
 Well, then, IΓÇÖll have to really get down to business now, too!
 What?! You mean you havenΓÇÖt even really gotten started yet?
 Hey! Intense Brow Sensei is a pretty good actor!
 HeΓÇÖs even taking more hits so that Bushy Brow won't know it's him.
 What? You were only attacked by monkeys?
 They were after the snacks that Choji procured
 but the important load is safe!
 My snacksΓÇª by a monkeyΓÇª
 Ino mistook that for an enemyΓÇÖs attack
 and sent out an emergency relief request.
 But, it was so sudden!
 Anyway, itΓÇÖs your fault for procuring so many snacks!
 These snacks were available only for a limited time,
 and moreover, only available in the Land of Tea,
 the Super-rare ΓÇ£Green tea Pork-flavoredΓÇ¥ chips!
 For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sin to refrain from buying
 a limited offering of snacks once one has found them!
 Like I care about stuff like that!
 What?
 What?!
 Shikamaru, things are tough for you, aren't they?
 Right back at you. That getupΓÇª Did something happen?
 Huh? What about my getupΓÇª?
 Here.
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs right! I havenΓÇÖt got time for dallying here!
 IΓÇÖve got to get over to LeeΓÇÖs dojo!
 Just wait for me, Lee!
 YouΓÇÖre overdoing on purposefully getting beaten, SenseiΓÇª
 Is he finished now?
 Whoa, hold it! Time out!
 Fight back a little, will you?!
 ItΓÇÖs impossible, I tell you.
 If Lee doesnΓÇÖt find this challenging enough,
 I might get stuck being his opponent.
 ActuallyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs been one extreme mission after another lately,
 and I havenΓÇÖt gotten any sleep at allΓÇª
 What? You donΓÇÖt sayΓÇª
 If I got a little rest, I think I might recover, butΓÇª
 While I take a rest, wonΓÇÖt you be his opponent for a while?
 What?!
 IΓÇÖm begging you!
 Wh-What is that?
 IΓÇÖm coming, Lee!
 G-Guy?
 I thought he already entered the village a while agoΓÇª
 S-Sorry to keep you waiting!
 You've weathered such an attack and you're still undamagedΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre quite a fellow!
 The world is vastΓÇª
 To think that such an awesome Dojo challenger exists!
 It was worth building this Dojo!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way I could win with only Taijutsu!
 If thatΓÇÖs the case, then IΓÇÖll fight my own wayΓÇª
 Here I come!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 But, of course! HeΓÇÖs well acquainted with Ninjutsu too!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 The real body isΓÇª right above me!
 Primary Lotus!
 Is this a clone, too?
 Got you!
 Here I go, one more time!
 Another Shadow Clone?
 NopeΓÇª!
 Stop it, Lee.
 S-Sakura?
 ΓÇô Be nice, now! ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt be too hard on me.
 ΓÇô Please! 					ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt be mean!
 So many SakuraΓÇª Guy Sensei! IΓÇÖm moved!
 IΓÇÖve never known such happiness before in my life!
 ΓÇô Cha! 					ΓÇô Cha!
 WhaΓÇª?!
 We did it!
 I guess I forgotΓÇª that this is a fight with a challenger.
 Just as one might expectΓÇª But I wonΓÇÖt fall for the same trick again!
 Even though they may look like Sakura, theyΓÇÖre really just phony Transformation!
 How can you say that, Lee?
 Hurry back, Sensei!
 For brats, they fight such a high-level fightΓÇª
 ΓÇô Leave it to Village Hidden in LeafsΓÇª ΓÇô How about this?!
 I wonder if the rumors that
 ΓÇô they lost its vigor were just lies? ΓÇô In that caseΓÇª
 ΓÇô I guess I need to ΓÇô Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 investigate this furtherΓÇª
 This disguise is problematicΓÇª
 I get a feeling I will be embroiled in trouble again.
 LetΓÇÖs go with this. Well then, shall I be taking my leave?
 Hold it right there!
 The real thing!
 I see that you are Rock Lee, master of this Dojo.
 Oh no. I guess IΓÇÖll have to play along with himΓÇª
 Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee, master of this dojoΓÇª
 I am a Dojo challenger!
 Rock Lee, I shall defeat you and claim your marquee!
 Here I come!
 You fight a pretty good fight.
 You, tooΓÇª
 H-Help!
 B-Bushy Brow?!
 Dynamic Entry!
 A-Another Dojo challenger?!
 Intense Brow Sensei! What took you so long?!
 N-NarutoΓÇªwhat's the meaning of this?
 If you canΓÇÖt dodge even this much of an attack,
 you are not worth all the talk!
 Your training is inadequate!
 N-NoΓÇª This isΓÇª I meanΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs about Million years too early for you to be building your own Dojo!
 I must straighten that spoiled attitude of yours with my own fist!
 Forgive me LeeΓÇª ltΓÇÖs my whip of love!
 So, the true identity of the challenger was you, Guy Sensei!
 What? YouΓÇÖre Lee? Then, who was I punching?
 WhoΓÇÖs that guy?
 Good griefΓÇª
 Come in! 					Oh, itΓÇÖs you, GuyΓÇª
 And youΓÇÖre with Naruto and Lee.
 ThatΓÇÖs perfect. I was just about to call you all.
 Has something happened?
 Just now, some intelligence came inΓÇª
 A Shinobi from the Land of Valleys, by the name of Nanafushi,
 is said to have been seeking inside information on our village.
 He may already have infiltrated the village.
 I want you to go search for this Nanafushi immediately and capture himΓÇª
 Oh!
 That manΓÇª
 You have an idea of where he might be?
 ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs this guy! ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs this man!
 I donΓÇÖt really know whatΓÇÖs going onΓÇª but our mission is complete!
 Well then, weΓÇÖll be going.
 Hey! DonΓÇÖt just leave him here!
 Oh! Guy Sensei!
 Explain what happened! Hey! Lee! Hey! Naruto!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardustΓÇÖs are rapidly dancing
 I just canΓÇÖt come out and say, ΓÇ£Ah, I donΓÇÖt want to go home yet.ΓÇ¥
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs from that coke I just drank?
 In the small hours of the morning when the trees and grasses are asleep
 and the forest is deathly calmΓÇª
 A signpost standing forlorn starts telling of the destruction of a clan.
 Suddenly with a strike of thunder, heavy rain begins to fall down.
 What could be the true identity of the Iron Castle that appeared?!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 IΓÇÖll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Sakura Blossoms!
 Huh?!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that and is the speed of sound!
 Lee!
 My left ear...
 ThereΓÇÖs a little gimmick I have.
 Evading wonΓÇÖt work... on my attacks.
 What is he going to do?!
 ItΓÇÖs sound.
 Even though you evaded my fist, sound assaulted you.
 Sound?
 Do you know what sound is all about in the first place?
 Vibration?
 Correct. In other words, hearing sounds means,
 that the eardrum is catching vibrating air.
 And the human eardrum breaks with sounds over 150 Mhz.
 Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal which is located even deeper,
 I can make you totally lose balance.
 You wonΓÇÖt be able to move your body freely for sometime.
 Something old and tired like Taijutsu donΓÇÖt work on us.
 Well, you were doing good up to a certain point,
 but I brought forth my Jutsu.
 ItΓÇÖs just not gonna work anymore.
 I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves and air pressure,
 and have the power to obliterate even boulders!
 Primary Lotus!
 I can send air into the ground
 and change the dirt into a cushion as I please.
 ItΓÇÖs different from your silly Jutsu.
 Blast it!
 Lee, it is all right to use this Jutsu
 to protect someone precious.
 Protect... someone precious?
 In any case,
 IΓÇÖm impressed that you were able to master it, little man!
 You did it quite well, Lee!
 Darn it!
 Okay, then!
 Next is...
 You!
 Darn it!
 HeΓÇÖs coming!
 What?!
 No way!
 Lee!
 Leaf...
 Hurricane!
 It looks like my earlier attack is having an effect!
 IΓÇÖm somewhat surprised...
 but thereΓÇÖs not even a trace of that flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!
 This arm amplifies sounds from within to its maximum.
 ItΓÇÖs a speaker of sorts!
 Lee!
 And the assault sound isnΓÇÖt limited by the direction of my arm...
 it always converges on the targeted prey by my Chakra!
 Lee!
 Now then... 					The final blow.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you!
 Oh, well.
 Hey, letΓÇÖs get outta here!
 Those guys are pretty dangerous!
 It looks like Sasuke and Naruto are only unconscious, but...
 even that guy LeeΓÇÖs been messed up and SakuraΓÇÖs alone.
 WhatΓÇÖre you gonna do, Ino?
 What do you mean?
 Well, SakuraΓÇÖs in deep trouble!
 YouΓÇÖre all right with that?
 Huh?!
 You two were once close friends, werenΓÇÖt you?
 By the way...
 What Sakura, donΓÇÖt be so stiff!
 Well...
 Ino, I hear you also...
 What is it?
 ...like Sasuke.
 Then, that means from now on,
 you and I are rivals.
 Why... why am I recalling things from that time?
 Hey, Ino!
 WhatΓÇÖre you gonna do?!
 I know, but thereΓÇÖs nothing I can do!
 I canΓÇÖt heedlessly go out there, can I?!
 Even if I went out now...
 IΓÇÖd be taken down without a doubt.
 I also...
 I also...!
 Air pressure! The shurikens got bounced back?!
 Your hairΓÇÖs shinier than mine.
 Hey! If you have time to worry about your hair,
 you should practice!
 Getting all spiced up like a woman...
 Why donΓÇÖt you kill that Sasuke guy right in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?
 Yeah! That sounds great!
 Hey hey...
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do such a thing!
 DonΓÇÖt move!
 Sakura.
 My body... It has no strength.
 I...
 Again... IΓÇÖm just pulling everyoneΓÇÖs feet!
 IΓÇÖm always being protected.
 It's so frustrating!
 This time for sure... I had thought!
 This time for sure...
 I must protect people precious to me... so I thought!
 So...
 LetΓÇÖs do this!
 Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are gonna get it, too!
 W-What should I do?!
 ThatΓÇÖs pointless!
 That wonΓÇÖt work on me!
 What are you saying?
 Huh?
 What?!
 I always...
 act as if IΓÇÖm a full-fledged Ninja.
 I always say that I like Sasuke.
 I always act like I know everything and lecture Naruto.
 I always just... watch them from behind.
 And yet...
 Tazuna, get back!
 Get back!
 Now then...
 LetΓÇÖs get wild!
 This is the only way to take him down!
 Sasuke!
 Here it is!
 Those two always covered my back and fought for me.
 Lee, you say that you like me...
 IΓÇÖll protect you until I die!
 Primary Lotus!
 With me at your back...
 you risked your life and fought for me.
 I have a feeling that you taught me...
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Humph!
 I want to be like all of you!
 This time...
 I want all of you...
 to watch me...
 ...from behind!
 Sakura?
 Sakura...
 Kin! Kill her!
 Huh! That sign...
 Substitution Jutsu!
 On the right, huh? You think IΓÇÖm a fool?
 With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...
 you think you can come at me?!
 Kin, get out of the way!
 Useless!
 Air pressure 100 percent, ultrasonic waves 0%, output...
 Is that all you can do?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 YouΓÇÖre easy to spot...
 YouΓÇÖre above!
 IΓÇÖve said it two or three times that that wonΓÇÖt work!
 This is enough... for you!
 Where next?
 Huh?!
 What...?!
 This time... itΓÇÖs not a substitution!
 Get off me! Hey!
 Sakura...
 YouΓÇÖre always being called ΓÇ£Billboard BrowΓÇ¥ and being picked on.
 WhoΓÇÖre you?
 IΓÇÖm called Ino Yamanaka. How ΓÇÿbout you?
 IΓÇÖm... Sakura.
 Huh? I canΓÇÖt hear you. Say it louder.
 Sakura Haruno!
 Huh, I see.
 You have a wide forehead.
 So, Billboard Brow, huh...?
 ThatΓÇÖs why you hide your forehead with your bangs.
 Like a ghost...
 Sakura, was it?
 Uh-huh...
 Come back here tomorrow.
 IΓÇÖll give you something nice.
 Huh?
 Darn, let go!
 See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!
 IΓÇÖll give you that ribbon.
 T-Thanks.
 But...
 But what?
 My forehead...
 You hide it, so people make more fun of you, you know?!
 You have a cute face Sakura, so you should be more confident!
 More confident!
 Ino...
 Hey, whoΓÇÖs that? WhoΓÇÖs she, Ino?
 Her nameΓÇÖs Sakura.
 Hey, say hello!
 Hello...
 Listen everybody! Listen!
 ThereΓÇÖs someone I like! Who do you think it is?
 Hurry up and tell us!
 DonΓÇÖt say itΓÇÖs Sasuke?
 Huh? WhyΓÇÖd you know?
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?
 SasukeΓÇÖs really popular, heΓÇÖs the most popular!
 Huh? Is that so?
 Oh no! IΓÇÖll have a lot of rivals. What should I do?!
 Hey, Ino! SakuraΓÇÖs been upbeat lately!
 SheΓÇÖs just acting brave and romping around!
 Ino! IΓÇÖve heard Sasuke likes girls with long hair.
 ...likes girls with long hair. ...likes girls with long hair.
 Sakura...
 IΓÇÖve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.
 From now on, weΓÇÖre rivals.
 Your hair. ItΓÇÖs grown quite a bit.
 Ino...
 Why...
 Why are you on the same team as Sasuke?!
 I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!
 Me too! I wonΓÇÖt lose to you, Sakura. No matter what!
 ...Sakura!
 I will...
 I will...
 Give it up!
 ItΓÇÖs really bad...
 Hey, Ino...!
 I must... protect everyone!
 You punk!
 Huh?
 Huh! More strange ones.
 Ino...?
 Sakura! I promised I wouldnΓÇÖt lose to you, didnΓÇÖt I?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Wow! This is Ino teamΓÇÖs battle?!
 What a formation based on calculations!
 I hate to admit it, but theyΓÇÖre strong!
 Even the Sound Village ones would be no match for them!
 WeΓÇÖll protect Sasuke...
 Huh?! WhatΓÇÖs this feeling?

 Then let's not play around...
 IΓÇÖll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.
 You bandaged cucumber roll!
 I know his Achilles heel all too well from my last battle with him.
 Those holes in his arm emit a pulsing sound, soΓÇª
 Ninja Art!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Followed by the Hidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!
 All I have to do is to prevent him from aiming at my ears!
 Human Boulder Jutsu!
 Hooray for Big-Boned!
 Good!
 Squash him, Choji!
 This guy can attack sonically without even touching the opponentΓÇª
 But thatΓÇÖs only when ears are showing!
 With ChojiΓÇÖs whole head buried, itΓÇÖs like heΓÇÖs wearing ear plugs.
 how does anyone make a sonic attack on a meat ball,
 let alone one thatΓÇÖs rolling?
 The way you areΓÇª you can barely move, can you?
 ThatΓÇÖs where I attack!
 ItΓÇÖs no use, IΓÇÖm wearing ear plugs.
 No, this is the end!
 Oh?!
 The human body is made up of 70% water, and water is able to transmit sound waves.
 In other words, your whole body is like one big ear.
 And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇªno, Orochimaru!
 IΓÇÖll have you know that... IΓÇÖm more than a mere guinea pig.
 Are you all right?
 I-I want to eat meatΓÇª
 Oh man... And the guy went easy on him, too.
 Although he lost, the least we can do for him is take him for some BBQ beef.
 ItΓÇÖs finally over.
 At long last, the Final RoundΓÇª
 With this, the preliminaries for the third exam is completed.
 A Shadow in Darkness: Danger Approaches Sasuke
 I wonder whatΓÇÖs happened to Naruto?
 LetΓÇÖs go outside now.
 Iruka Sensei hasnΓÇÖt been alert recently, so nowΓÇÖs our chance.
 Hey!
 Konohamaru!
 You intend to sneak out again, do you?
 I-I need to go to the bathroom!
 Liar!
 To everyone who has advanced to the Final Round
 of the third test of the Chunin Exams,
 thereΓÇÖs one person whoΓÇÖs missing, but, congratulations.
 SenseiΓÇª
 Hmm?
 I have a question.
 About Sasuke?
 Well, IΓÇÖm sorry, but I donΓÇÖt know much.
 But donΓÇÖt worry too much.
 From here on, itΓÇÖs up to Sasuke.
 Sakura, I have to step out for a moment.
 Please inquire about the details of the Final Round!
 Sure.
 Here, in our house, including Sasuke whoΓÇÖs not here,
 we have five Leaf,
 three Sand,
 and one Sound.
 Well, I will begin the explanation of the Final Round.
 Finally!
 The preliminary battles have ended without incident.
 It seems theyΓÇÖre now entering the Final Round.
 This land really has become peaceful, hasnΓÇÖt it?
 This peaceful time has put this country in slumber...
 while all the other lands are busy racing to expand their military.
 Would it be possible for us to take it now?
 Humph, I suppose.
 Though, I donΓÇÖt know how much fun it would be to take out that old man.
 Is that so?
 To me, it looks like you are still have a hesitation about it.
 From now on, the power of each Hidden Village will clash
 with one another in a long and violent manner.
 The Sound village is also one of themΓÇª
 You intend to be the trigger for all of thatΓÇª
 And use him for a bullet.
 Our SasukeΓÇªright?
 You guess well.
 So well that itΓÇÖs a bit creepy.
 Not in the slightest.
 I still had no idea about Dosu, Zaku or Kin.
 In gathering information on Sasuke,
 I desired to learn their skills
 and carried out tactless things like deliberately subjecting myself to an attack.
 You overestimated me.
 It seems that youΓÇª
 you donΓÇÖt trust me completelyΓÇªyet.
 Was it necessary to tell you, my right-hand man,
 about the likes of those three?
 You see, therein lies the very proof of my trust.
 And because I doΓÇª
 I would like to leave Sasuke in your hands.
 The Curse Mark that was given to himΓÇª
 appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.
 Though, that wonΓÇÖt matter much.
 While there is still some darkness left in his heartΓÇª
 I want you to abduct him.
 ThatΓÇÖs an uncharacteristically hasty request, is it not?
 ThereΓÇÖs a little something troubling meΓÇª
 Is it Naruto Uzumaki?
 YouΓÇÖre quite a sharp one, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Sasuke has lived for revenge against his older brother Itachi,
 and will not rest until he has achieved that aim.
 Nevertheless, in battle with me,
 he was aware that there were things beyond his power and
 faced death without fear.
 I didnΓÇÖt think heΓÇÖd be the type of person who would be in a hurry to die.
 According to your information,
 contact with that Nine-Tailed kid has altered SasukeΓÇÖs heart and mind.
 So much so, that he possesses some influence over Sasuke.
 The best thing to do is to get Sasuke away from him immediatelyΓÇª
 And quickly turn him in my color.
 Well, thenΓÇª
 KabutoΓÇª
 You...
 If you wish to stop meΓÇª
 You have no choice but to kill young Sasuke, now.
 You canΓÇÖt possibly kill meΓÇª
 Though you are strong, youΓÇÖre only in the same league as Kakashi.
 Just kiddingΓÇª
 Now, run along.
 I trust you.
 That faceΓÇª
 I wonder what could possibly be going on in his head?
 The Final Round is where each one of you
 will show off your battle skills in front of everyone.
 I want you to satisfactorily demonstrate and show off your ability
 as representative battle forces of your respective lands.
 Accordingly, the Final Round will commence one month from now.
 W-WeΓÇÖre not going to do it here, right now?
 This is so that thereΓÇÖs a suitable period of preparation.
 What do you mean?
 That is to sayΓÇª
 Along with the announcement of the conclusion
 of the preliminary match to each countryΓÇÖs Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,
 readying the summons for Final Round requires preparation timeΓÇö
 not to mention the time it takes for you examinees to prepare.
 This old man always has such a roundabout way of saying things.
 I donΓÇÖt quite get what youΓÇÖre trying to say.
 What do you mean?
 In other words, in order to know your adversary,
 in order to prepare yourself, time is necessary.
 Time to analyze what you learned about the adversaries in the preliminaries...
 time to take stock of your successes.
 The battles until now were like actual battles-
 it presupposed situations in which you canΓÇÖt know your adversary.
 ThatΓÇÖs for sureΓÇª
 I never dreamed that this guy could make sand into a weapon.
 However, this is not the case in the Final Round.
 Some of you might have already revealed everything in front of your rivalsΓÇª
 In the spirit of fairness and equality,
 you will have a month to train yourself to further your skills.
 Now, I canΓÇÖt be thinking of this
 as some sort of month-long holiday and do nothing! Believe it!
 Seriously! Seriously!
 It might not be good idea to excel too much, is it?
 We failed to stay out of OrochimaruΓÇÖs watchful eye,
 and it was unfortunate for us both.
 Under this gentle exterior, a seed of evil took root ΓÇô
 and it was this seed that was exploitedΓÇª
 Some day, through that NinjutsuΓÇª
 this child will as wellΓÇª
 KabutoΓÇª
 Who knows?
 Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.
 I have to give it you, KakashiΓÇª
 Stopping my attack from your blind spotΓÇª
 But, youΓÇÖd better ready at least 10 of your men next time.
 The Anbu that I prepared were taken out without difficultyΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre not an ordinary Genin are you?
 You caught a whiff of me and immediately readied your weaponΓÇª
 youΓÇÖre quite impressive.
 No, IΓÇÖm not all that.
 What do you want with Sasuke?
 Depending on circumstances, IΓÇÖll haul you off to questioning.
 I wonder if thatΓÇÖs possible for the likes of youΓÇª
 Are you looking to take me on?
 You are the son of the chief of the Leaf medical corps, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?
 Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?
 If you arrest me here now,
 you might never be able to prove my connection to Orochimaru.
 Shut up and confine your answers to my questions.
 What if I say ΓÇ£NoΓÇ¥?
 IΓÇÖm the one asking the questions around here.
 Now give me some answers.
 YouΓÇÖll find out before long anyway if you let me go,
 so can you make an exception just this once?
 You, willful little bratΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt mess around with grown-ups.
 DonΓÇÖt be so arrogant.
 The circumstances are in my favorΓÇª
 I should have known.
 A shadow clone!
 DarnΓÇªI've let him escape.
 ImpressiveΓÇª
 As I suspected...
 This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,
 where one temporarily animates and controls the heart of a dead body.
 Meticulously transforming even the faceΓÇª
 and also stopping his heartbeats and eliminating all traces of his body odorΓÇª
 in order to prepare an escape by impersonating a murdered AnbuΓÇª
 He wasn't raised as the adopted son of the chief of the medical corps for nothing.
 If someone this good is working for OrochimaruΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt stay as I am nowΓÇª
 Now that thatΓÇÖs doneΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like to let you take your leaveΓÇª
 But first, for the Final Round,
 there is one more important matter to take care of.
 LetΓÇÖs get on with it, so we can get to training!
 Now, now. I want you all to calmly take one slip of paper
 from the box that Anko is holding.
 IΓÇÖm going to go around in orderΓÇª take only one.
 Good, everyone has taken a number.
 Then, from left to right, tell me  the number on your slip of paper.
 IΓÇÖm eight.
 IΓÇÖm one.
 Seven.
 Five.
 Three.
 Nine.
 Two.
 Six.
 In other words, he has number four.
 Uh-huh.
 Very well, I will tell you
 about how the Final Round tournament will work.
 Huh?
 Is that what these drawing lots were for?
 Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.
 Yes, sir.
 HeΓÇÖs so far away.
 Is that all the Final Round is, a tournament?
 Shoot! I have one extra round.
 Vendetta for Choji? Give me a break!
 IΓÇÖm so relieved to know that I wonΓÇÖt be in the same section as Gaara.
 Sasuke UchihaΓÇª
 Perfect.
 Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?
 This couldnΓÇÖt be better! Believe it!
 Sasuke has to go up against himΓÇª?
 Could I ask a question?
 Go ahead.
 Does this mean that there will only be one winner of the tournament?
 That only one of us will be able to become a Chunin?
 No, on the contrary.
 The judges of the Final Round, of which I am one,
 will be made up of the Kazekage,
 the Daimyo from various countries who will assign you your missions,
 and the Shinobi Leaders.
 Through this tournament,
 these judges will be able to make a thorough evaluation,
 and come to a decision as to whether each one of you
 possesses the qualities incumbent of a Chunin.
 Even if someone loses the first round, they can still become a Chunin.
 So thereΓÇÖs a chance that all of us will become Chunin?
 Correct, but conversely, thereΓÇÖs also a chance that none of you will.
 To ΓÇ£advanceΓÇ¥ in the tournament,
 means maximizing chances to appeal yourselves to the judges.
 Understood, Shikamaru?
 This is all a real pain in myΓÇª
 Thank you for your patience.
 We will adjourn until next month.
 The second round will either be No Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?
 That guy is so strong he kicked Bushy BrowΓÇÖs butt.
 Sand Coffin!
 I want to fight you, too.
 Now that itΓÇÖs come to this, IΓÇÖve got to see Kakashi Sensei.
 Umm, whereΓÇÖs the room that SasukeΓÇÖs in?
 IΓÇÖm sorry. Mr. Sasuke is not allowed visitors.
 What?! Hey, hey! What's up with that?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry, those are the rules.
 Why, Sis, tell me why?
 Naruto, this is a hospital. Keep it down.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Say! Say!
 IΓÇÖve got a favor to ask!
 You donΓÇÖt need to say it all.
 Well, I thought it would come to this soΓÇª
 I searched for someone to watch your training.
 Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
 I have some matters to take care of.
 I donΓÇÖt have the time to trouble myself with you.
 Oh! Aha...!
 YouΓÇÖre going to train Sasuke, arenΓÇÖt you!
 Well, don't say that.
 I found a sensei whoΓÇÖs more reliable than I am!
 WellΓÇªwho is it?
 ItΓÇÖs me!
 Huh?
 You!
 The Closet Perve!
 Such insolence!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Darn! IΓÇÖm not satisfied with this!
 I don't care if youΓÇÖre elite tutor or whatever,
 but thereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖm not going to get stronger
 if IΓÇÖm to learn from the Closet Perve weaker than me!
 I have to get strong by any means necessary, no matter what!
 If youΓÇÖre really a strong ninja,
 just try to convince me with your sheer strength!

119,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 IΓÇÖll let you out of here.
 And IΓÇÖll grant you one wish, too.
 You donΓÇÖt have to worry.
 Your strong will is going to remain as Residual Aura inside me.
 ItΓÇÖs not like youΓÇÖll lose everything.
 Now then, your flesh is mine.
 With this, Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs body has once again
 become unable to reanimate for several years.
 However thereΓÇÖs a next timeΓÇª
 I-Indeed. My body no longer has value as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
 It will now be difficult for me who has lost everythingΓÇª
 to find my own calling.
 IΓÇÖve finally understood that.
 Even if itΓÇÖs not meΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll bring in the new ΓÇ£vessel,ΓÇ¥ even if it costs me my life.
 ThatΓÇÖs my repayment to Lord Orochimaru.
 ThatΓÇÖs the only redemption for meΓÇª who was worthless.
 Miscalculation: A New Enemy Appears!
 TheyΓÇÖre fast.
 Akamaru.
 Come quick after youΓÇÖve set the bombs!
 Oh no!
 All right.
 Great.
 Akamaru, well done.
 Messing with me.
 Akamaru.
 DonΓÇÖt you ΓÇ£arfΓÇ¥ me, you mutt!
 IΓÇÖll waste you.
 Hold on.
 You!
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Damn it.
 WhatΓÇÖs happening?
 You punks!
 Where are Kiba and Akamaru?!
 Another oneΓÇÖs come.
 We have no choice.
 IΓÇÖll take care of this, so you take the coffin and go on ahead.
 ShikamaruΓÇª
 Get going already.
 Wh-Why are youΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm sorry, Naruto. ltΓÇÖs my miscalculation.
 Kimimaro.
 You were taking too long, Tayuya.
 And what happened to the other three?
 Being none other than those of the former ΓÇ£Sound Ninja Five.ΓÇ¥
 Why are youΓÇª?
 Your bodyΓÇª Your bodyΓÇÖs no longerΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not moving with the flesh anymore. ltΓÇÖs mental power.
 Man, you cheater of deathΓÇª
 I understand a little now, that feelingΓÇª
 of being information that has escaped from the prison of the flesh.
 The feeling of experiencing a taste of Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs dream.
 OrochimaruΓÇª!
 This vesselΓÇªis an important vessel for the dreamΓÇª
 The flesh that Lord Orochimaru truly desires.
 But you guys were a bit too late.
 Some dangerous guy has appeared again.
 That air about him is nothing ordinary.
 Anyway, we need to sort out the situation.
 If we were to carelessly plunge inΓÇª
 You jerk. WhatΓÇÖre you babbling nonsense?
 Naruto!
 Give back Sasuke!
 Hey, wait!
 Tayuya.
 The reason why I wonΓÇÖt kill you now
 is because you have a mission you have to complete.
 And my mission is to deliver that to Lord Orochimaru.
 IsnΓÇÖt it too late now?
 Humph. I told you.
 ThatΓÇÖs the body that Lord Orochimaru truly desires.
 The next vessel, huh?
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 And this is the only thing that I can do at present.
 I leave those two pieces of garbage to you.
 SasukeΓÇª
 That punk!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 How can I calm down?
 At this rate, Sasuke will get far away again.
 NarutoΓÇÖs right.
 This is a mission to bring Sasuke back to the Leaf Village.
 We must choose what would be the most rational means
 to execute the mission.
 Damned punks.
 IΓÇÖll finish this in a flash.
 Naruto, listen up.
 Please move according to the plan that IΓÇÖm going to tell you.
 HeΓÇÖs a classic close-range combat-type fool
 with Shadow Clone Jutsu as his only saving grace.
 And heΓÇÖs a middle-range combat type
 who binds his enemies with a Jutsu using shadowsΓÇª
 and a sharp squad leader, huh?
 Got it?
 Yeah.
 Come on already, you punks.
 ItΓÇÖs two versus one. WeΓÇÖve got the upper hand.
 ItΓÇÖs an opponent we can beat if we team up.
 LetΓÇÖs go, Naruto.
 All right.
 With garbage like you jerks,
 it doesnΓÇÖt matter how many of you are there.
 DonΓÇÖt underestimate our teamwork.
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Bring it.
 Now... Naruto.
 IΓÇÖll blow you away.
 Gotcha. The strategy is a success.
 Farewell.
 Blast.
 You tricked me.
 Teamwork, my foot. You little punksΓÇª
 Blast.
 You wouldnΓÇÖt fall for the same trick over and over, huh..?
 Small fryΓÇª YouΓÇÖve got nerve.
 Well, I guess IΓÇÖll settle for just having been able to let him get away.
 Remember this.
 ItΓÇÖs not just Jutsu that are weapons.
 IΓÇÖm counting on you, Shikamaru.
 Hang in there, Sasuke.
 But that kid,
 how wonderful it is that he can move with that body, eh?
 Kabuto, I donΓÇÖt know what kind of order you gave him,
 but itΓÇÖs a bit harsh.
 Not at all. lt wasnΓÇÖt an order.
 I donΓÇÖt like to force things.
 He acted on his own.
 For you whom he reveres.
 KabutoΓÇªYouΓÇÖve really got a hateful personality, donΓÇÖt you?
 Lord Orochimaru.
 To you, Kimimaro was a perfect existenceΓÇª
 His thoughts were steeped in darkness in the same way as yours.
 And he sanctified you.
 And he fanatically admired and revered you.
 Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clan with the strongest and perfect bodies
 being the legitimate bloodline of their Kekkai GenkaiΓÇª
 until a short time ago.
 YesΓÇª
 When I think about having lost him, I still get a chill down my spine.
 I think about it even nowΓÇª
 The man I truly wished forΓÇª The body I wanted the mostΓÇªKimimaro.
 And if only he hadnΓÇÖt been stricken with disease,
 the assassination of the Hokage wouldΓÇÖve gone smoother.
 Seal!
 My armsΓÇª.
 NowΓÇªyou can no longer use either of your armsΓÇª
 And since you can't use your arms,
 you can't weave SignΓÇª
 You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
 Your ambition of crushing the Hidden LeafΓÇªdies right here!
 Orochimaru, you foolΓÇª
 It's unfortunate that we can't leave together but, my discipleΓÇª
 Let's meet in the other world one dayΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª SasukeΓÇÖs not here yet?
 We wouldnΓÇÖt have needed to go through such an experience.
 In the world, very often things donΓÇÖt go as we want them to.
 ItΓÇÖs only a matter of time, Lord Orochimaru.
 When TayuyaΓÇªcomes back, IΓÇÖll kill her.
 Hold it.
 HeyΓÇª!
 Now then, how shall I defeat you?
 YouΓÇª
 Those eyesΓÇª
 It seems he possesses a peculiar Chakra.
 What does Orochimaru want to doΓÇª? WhyΓÇÖs he after Sasuke?
 Lord Orochimaru has already obtained Immortality JutsuΓÇª
 A long time is necessary to get every Jutsu and obtain everything in the world.
 What does that have to do with Sasuke?!
 ΓÇ£ImmortalΓÇ¥ doesnΓÇÖt mean that the flesh is being maintained as isΓÇª
 Before his body decays,
 a strong and new flesh will be made into a vessel for his soul.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Are you saying thatΓÇÖs Sasuke?!
 YesΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs right.
 I wonΓÇÖt let such a thing happen!
 IdiotΓÇª What will come of sending one shrimp punk in pursuit?
 And looking at things in terms of time,
 up until now you probably sacrificed one member each time
 in order for the group to move forward.
 Is that guy called Sasuke that important?
 How many of your men do you intend to sacrifice for the sake of just one person?
 You incompetent punk.
 HehΓÇª IndeedΓÇª
 For me, this is my first mission as a platoon leader.
 ItΓÇÖs very disquieting having comrades gradually whittled down,
 and I didnΓÇÖt know if my own judgments were correct or not.
 As a squad leader with the lives of the party in my handsΓÇª
 respecting the lives in the four-member party,
 rather than the life of one person taken by the enemyΓÇª
 and deciding to abort a mission thatΓÇÖs too dangerous, would be by the book.
 Then, why didnΓÇÖt you do that?
 The world doesnΓÇÖt go by the book very oftenΓÇª
 Since not one person in my squad would do something like
 abandon a captured comrade and give up fighting for the sake of their own safety.
 Me included.
 Being the cloud-loving loafer myself,
 I am not cut out to be a squad leader who gives orders to comrades.
 The only thing I can do for them... is to have faith in them.
 Listen. IΓÇÖm not thinking anything like they were sacrifices.
 IΓÇÖm not thinking anything like theyΓÇÖve died.
 DonΓÇÖt mock my comrades.
 I got you.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 This doesnΓÇÖtΓÇªlook so good.
 IΓÇÖll play a melody of death for you.
 DonΓÇÖt you mock us, you damned punk.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you take Sasuke, no matter what.
 Interesting.
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 Damn it! What'll I do?!
 He's trouble enough yet,
 but his Chakra has increased several ten-fold!
 It's no good. I can't use it here yet.
 But if I stay like this, we'llΓÇª
 I get it, Akamaru.
 It's like you said.
 I have no choice but to use it!

 All right! IΓÇÖm up for it today again, believe it!
 HoweverΓÇª There havenΓÇÖt been any flashy missions around here lately.
 CΓÇÖmon! ItΓÇÖs unbelievable, right?!
 Yeah wellΓÇª
 Lately, IΓÇÖm dead tired from doing nothing but training.
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 ThereΓÇÖs someone who got too much time on his hands!
 WhatΓÇÖs that?! Speak for yourself.
 No matter how I look at it, you are just helping the shop.
 What happened to Shikamaru and Choji?
 On a mission with Asuma Sensei!
 Oh, I wanted to go on a mission too!
 While Ino was down with a cold, everyone went on urgent missions.
 And now IΓÇÖm completely recovered!
 What am I going to do with all my fighting spirit?
 Why donΓÇÖt you use that fighting spirit in some training?
 ThatΓÇÖs what you think!
 In my family, if you donΓÇÖt have a training partner,
 then they make up some reason for you to help out with the shop!
 They must know that if youΓÇÖre alone youΓÇÖll skip training, eh?
 H-Hey! Don't say something that could hurt a personΓÇÖs reputation!
 I do it properly by myself.

 Stop it, Shino! DonΓÇÖt surprise me!
 Naruto UzumakiΓÇª Yamanaka InoΓÇª
 The Hokage is asking for both of you.
 What? Me too?
 By the way, IΓÇÖve also been ordered to go, along with you guys.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 InoΓÇª me and Shino?
 Huh?
 Demon of Ocean causing disturbanceΓÇª?
 Yes, literally a demon in the ocean.
 It seems to be the cause of the disturbance happening in the remote Land of SeaΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs wrongΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖll go for me, wonΓÇÖt you?
 Of course.
 ShizuneΓÇª
 Y-Yes!
 ExplainΓÇª
 Y-Yes!
 As you can see,
 the Land of Sea is made up of a group of islands of various sizes.
 Recently in that area, their only means of transportation, ships,
 are being attacked and robbed of money and valuables.
 The people on the boat who were victimized
 unanimously claim that the damage was done by the ΓÇ£Demon of the Ocean.ΓÇ¥
 And exterminating this Demon of the Ocean is the mission?
 WellΓÇª more or less, yes. But thereΓÇÖs more.
 The Land of Sea does not have a hidden village of its own,
 so theyΓÇÖre prepared for contingencies
 through military cooperation with the neighboring country, the Land of Water,
 and have been paying them a retainer every monthΓÇª
 However, the other day, one of their ships that collects funds
 was attacked by the Demon of the Ocean as wellΓÇª
 I see. To preserve their relationship with Land of Water,
 Land of Sea will do anything to protect the next ship.
 YesΓÇª This mission is to guard the ships collecting funds
 and destroy the Demon of the OceanΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve got a few people to work under you, so IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 Work under meΓÇª ?

 Characteristics of the Demon of the Ocean...
 ItΓÇÖs like a fish, like a person... What is this?!
 Huh, someoneΓÇÖs eyes are playing tricks. Something like that canΓÇÖt exist!
 Not true, itΓÇÖs possible that Ex-Ninja become pirates
 and use Transformation and Genjutsu.
 Well, whatever, if we donΓÇÖt gather information, there will be no solution.
 RightΓÇª
 Mother Island is the biggest island at the center of Land of SeaΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll go to a nearby fishing port and cross over by boat!
 ΓÇô I understand! ΓÇô I understand!
 Yeah! LetΓÇÖs depart for the Land of Sea!

 Hmm?
 ItΓÇÖs aboutΓÇªAnko Mitarashi just nowΓÇª
 Did, uhΓÇª Did something happen in the past?
 Sort ofΓÇª
 Oh? This isΓÇª
 Her record of missions from about the age of ten is pretty sporadic.
 Because Anko was under Orochimaru...
 So the parts that are blacked out
 are combined with OrochimaruΓÇÖs movementsΓÇª
 and in the confidential file?
 Part of them areΓÇª
 Huh?
 There are some parts that arenΓÇÖt recordedΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the truth.
 No record?! Even though Anko herself was in the village?
 That OrochimaruΓÇª
 It seems he really didnΓÇÖt want to be tracedΓÇª
 When he left the villageΓÇª
 He erased part of AnkoΓÇÖs memories.
 The wind is saltyΓÇª
 Coming this far, we can already see over the Land of Sea.
 Then, that must be the Mother Island?
 What ? What is this feeling?
 EveryoneΓÇª Sorry butΓÇª
 Go ahead and take care of the arrangements for the boat.
 What? But, what would you do, Sensei?
 IΓÇÖll take care of some business and join youΓÇª See you!

 CΓÇÖmon, it canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 What are you doing, Shino?
 WeΓÇÖll leave you behind!

 Hey, mister!
 ArenΓÇÖt you bringing prices down way too much?
 ThatΓÇÖs high-quality fish, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Oh dearΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not price-cuttingΓÇª
 See...
 Because of that  ""Demon of the Ocean""  uproar,
 customers are completely staying away...
 This is the market price around here.
 Really? That fish is rarelyΓÇª Oh!
 WhatΓÇÖs with her appearance? ls she injured or something?
 NoΓÇª That girl, she has her reasons.
 WellΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs a female diver from a small town on the cape of Mother IslandΓÇª
 What?!
 Why would a woman diver on Mother Island transfer islands on purpose?
 ThatΓÇÖs because, the island people didnΓÇÖt want to do business with herΓÇª
 That girlΓÇª
 In the past, she was spirited awayΓÇª
 Spirited awayΓÇª?
 A person suddenly disappearsΓÇª is that it?
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 In the past,
 a lot of island people disappeared from being spirited away.
 The story is that out of all those people
 that girl was the only one who suddenly returned one day.
 Hey, hey!
 ItΓÇÖs a little villageΓÇª
 So everyone felt creepy.
 They say that now, she lives alone outside of the villageΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª I feel sorry for her.
 With her appearance... And then you hear things, I too...
 feel a little bit creepyΓÇª
 That's true.

 But the sun hasnΓÇÖt even set yetΓÇª
 Around here, thereΓÇÖs nobody who will take you across in the early evening...
 Sorry, but come back tomorrow.
 No wayΓÇª
 Well, is there a way to get to Mother Island besides the ferry?
 Mmm, I canΓÇÖt really advise it, butΓÇª
 If itΓÇÖs necessary, IΓÇÖll let you borrow my little boat.
 Hey! I was looking all over for you guys!
 CΓÇÖmon! Where were you?!
 Sorry, sorryΓÇª
 You should at least say something before you disappear.
 You and Sensei are exactly alike, suddenly going someplace.
 Feels like thereΓÇÖll be a bumpy road ahead.
 What?! ThatΓÇÖs rude.
 Placing me in the same category together with that unreasonable sensei--!
 WhoΓÇÖs what?
 S-Sorry.
 This senseiΓÇª is dangerous, after allΓÇª
 Good work procuring the boat!
 S-SenseiΓÇª Where in the world have you been all this time?
 Oh, something like gathering informationΓÇª
 Well, letΓÇÖs go!
 The Shinobi of Leaf Village are hereΓÇª
 Land of Sea must have pleaded with them
 to investigate on the ΓÇ£Demon of the Ocean.ΓÇ¥
 Well then, we should give them the best welcome.
 ItΓÇÖs getting darkΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre almost to Mother Island.
 All right, all right!
 Full speed advance to Mother Island!
 Although the sun has already set ...
 Where does all your hyper-energy come from?!
 Times like this, your state of mind is important!
 Sakura sure has her share of troubleΓÇª I feel sorry for her.
 What theΓÇª! I ran up against a rock or something!
 Hang in there, Naruto!
 Hey, all of you look forward, front!
 Dodge it, quick!

 What?!
 Hey! Naruto! What kind of place did you call me to?!
 Why did you come out! You stupid frog!
 Oh! Hey, wait!
 Summoning Jutsu.
 Please come out, Chief Toad!
 Hey, good evening!
 It can't be! I have been calling for Chief Toad!
 Stupid! If you summoned the old man to a place like this,
 terrible things would happen.
 Huh? Why?
 WeΓÇÖre freshwater creatures! We donΓÇÖt go with saltwater!
 I donΓÇÖt like salty things either.
 YouΓÇÖre no help at all!
 Shino! Take care of InoΓÇª
 Okay!
 All right!

 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 To think the departure of the collection ship
 would be moved up at the time like this.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped.
 WeΓÇÖve got to find Naruto somehow by tomorrow morning.
 I hope we pick up some information about the Demon of the Ocean along the way.
 The search range is quite expansive, huh?
 ItΓÇÖd be best to split up.
 Then IΓÇÖll go from the south, you guys take the north.

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so donΓÇÖt hide your fists
 YouΓÇÖre not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 DonΓÇÖt forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Blaze Away, Byakugan! This is My Ninja Way!!
 Kiba!
 Naruto!
 This isnΓÇÖt good.
 Oh my, whatΓÇÖs wrong?
 So youΓÇÖll just stay there and become larvae food?
 Queen BeeΓÇª
 That kind of stuff shouldnΓÇÖt be effective, should it?!
 ChakraΓÇª!
 Byakugan!
 ItΓÇÖs no goodΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs no way I can make it in time!
 NarutoΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know when to give up!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 I know that Naruto would never give up, no matter what the situation is!
 Hey, did you catch them?
 What a foolish group!
 They made this creature madΓÇª
 And they all got bound in wax!
 Bees make wax.
 YouΓÇÖre an insect handler and you donΓÇÖt know that?
 HeΓÇÖs right! CΓÇÖmon, are you really an insect handler?
 What about the Bikochu?
 Nothing.
 We did an all-out mobilization and searched,
 but we havenΓÇÖt found it.
 ArenΓÇÖt these guys carrying it?
 ThatΓÇÖs unthinkable.
 So that meansΓÇª
 So weΓÇÖre going to have to ask one of these guys, after all.
 WhoΓÇÖs gonna talk?!
 We can tell you.
 Shino!
 HoweverΓÇª ltΓÇÖs in exchange for Hinata.
 ThatΓÇÖs stupid, isnΓÇÖt it? To bargainΓÇª
 Do you not understand your position?
 You guys definitely will not find the Bikochu.
 And youΓÇÖre pressed for time.
 You are the onesΓÇªwho will regret it.
 What should we do?
 If things stay like this,
 the Bikochu wonΓÇÖt be of any help even if it hatches.
 In that case, our mission is alsoΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 If we can get rid of even one of the Aburame familyΓÇª
 HinataΓÇª
 Are you worried?
 Of course!
 SheΓÇÖs strong.
 Huh?
 Much moreΓÇªthan you think.
 I concede. We have a deal.
 First of all, we need our friend.
 What happened?
 The bratΓÇªisnΓÇÖt here.
 The wax she was trapped in isnΓÇÖt there.ΓÇª
 She may have been swept out to the waterfall.
 Jibachi!
 It canΓÇÖt be helped! I warned her not to make a bad move or sheΓÇÖd die.
 You!
 What did you do to Hinata?!
 What happened to Hinata! Hey!
 Shut up, kid.
 The kidΓÇÖs probably in the depths of hell about now.
 Damn you!
 Aha, the girlΓÇÖs your girlfriend?
 YouΓÇª! I absolutely will not forgive you!
 YouΓÇÖre kidding me. What can you do looking like that?
 Without Hinata youΓÇÖll never get your hands on the Bikochu either.
 You are rightΓÇª
 That girlΓÇÖs death was not part of the plan,
 but in the end, itΓÇÖs a good thing.
 BecauseΓÇªweΓÇÖll take your lives in return.
 From the very beginning, people from the Village Hidden in the Leaves and
 from my own Village Hidden in the Stones have been sworn enemies.
 ItΓÇÖs natural that we kill each other, isnΓÇÖt it?
 What're ya gonna do, little guy?
 Die like this?
 Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is, I could save you for now.
 ΓÇô All right. ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt you dare tell them!
 Those jerks, IΓÇÖm going to blow them away!
 Shut up, brat!
 ΓÇô Jibachi? 					ΓÇô Hey!
 Shut up, IΓÇÖve got to kill him!
 ItΓÇÖs a Paper Bomb!
 YouΓÇÖreΓÇª!
 Y-YouΓÇÖreΓÇª!
 ΓÇªstill alive!
 That was really close. But I didnΓÇÖt give up, just like NarutoΓÇª
 Did she escape from the wax? lt canΓÇÖt be!
 These are not ordinary kids.
 Leave it to me!
 Hinata!
 IΓÇÖve never used that in an actual fightΓÇª
 But I have to do it here, now!
 Bee Bombs Jutsu!
 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
 Bee Swarm Jutsu!
 NarutoΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª Watch me.
 Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 YouΓÇÖre kidding, right?
 That Hinata can do such an amazing Jutsu?
 The Hinata that you know, Naruto, is from when?
 What do you mean?
 YouΓÇÖve learned new Jutsu since the Chunin Ninja Exam, havenΓÇÖt you?
 Hinata has been steadily developing, too.
 She always has been concernedΓÇª
 Take aim.
 ThatΓÇÖs nice, the three of you,
 all have something youΓÇÖre good at and something you like.
 Hinata, you should find something, tooΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 By the way, what is it?
 You had some business with me, didnΓÇÖt you?
 YeahΓÇª
 I want you to join me in my training.
 Hinata was fretting over what she could doΓÇª
 What she should doΓÇª
 Hinata!
 Hey, I donΓÇÖt think that we shouldΓÇª
 NoΓÇª DonΓÇÖt go easy on me!
 If youΓÇÖre doing it for meΓÇª
 Do it seriously!
 IΓÇÖve got it!
 During the harsh training,
 Hinata discovered her own stylesΓÇª and her own special Jutsu.
 ThatΓÇÖs the result of her training.
 Huh? You, why!?
 IΓÇÖll tell you somethingΓÇª
 Angering the Queen Bee, getting encased in wax,
 it was all part of the strategy.
 With our Chakra being sucked and being immobilized,
 it was the only way to protect ourselves from the larvaeΓÇª
 And, do you think I was doing nothing while I was captured?
 I was ordering my bugs. The wax weΓÇÖre wrapped in is very weak.
 Shino!
 Because of her hard training,
 HinataΓÇÖs Chakra control has dramatically improved.
 That Jutsu is what she developed from the trainingΓÇª
 Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms!
 HinataΓÇÖs already flexible body combined with fine-tuned Chakra control
 could completely defend an attack from every directionΓÇª
 Truly, itΓÇÖs an ultimate defense Jutsu.
 Yet itΓÇÖs different from NejiΓÇÖs 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.
 ItΓÇÖs HinataΓÇÖs own JutsuΓÇª
 She finally worked that out on her own.
 She probably did it because she wanted to be acknowledged by her father.
 To be acknowledged by everyoneΓÇª
 And to be acknowledged by you.
 Our Jutsu isnΓÇÖt effective at all?!
 What the hell is going on?
 What a girl!
 Hey, what happened to those guys?!
 When did they?!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Blow them away!
 Hinata!
 Shino!
 BelieveΓÇªin her.
 Make the ChakraΓÇª
 sharper, strongerΓÇª
 bigger, more flexibleΓÇª
 moreΓÇªmoreΓÇªmoreΓÇª moreΓÇªmoreΓÇªmoreΓÇªmore!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Hinata, thatΓÇÖs an awesome Jutsu! YouΓÇÖre really awesome!
 NarutoΓÇª!
 LetΓÇÖs hurry. ItΓÇÖll be dawn soon.
 ΓÇô Okay! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 Oh, itΓÇÖs becoming a pupa already?
 If we make it smell SasukeΓÇÖs scent at the moment it hatches,
 the mission is complete.
 Right!
 SasukeΓÇª Wait for me!
 No way!
 Inside the tree, huh.
 If it was there, the bees should have found itΓÇª
 You can still move?
 This insect cage was coated with secret Aburame family insect repellent.
 Wh-What?
 The bees wonΓÇÖt come close because of the repellent.
 As long as youΓÇÖre using bees to searchΓÇª you definitely wonΓÇÖt find it.
 I expected as much.
 I think as long as your clan existsΓÇª
 my clan maybe destined to be ruined some day.
 But!
 I absolutely will not let you succeed at your mission!
 Even if it kills me, that BikochuΓÇª
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 This is our hopeΓÇª in order to get our friend back!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do that!
 Shut up!
 Rasengan!
 Hey, lookΓÇª
 The pupa is hatching!
 Okay!
 Huh? It's gone!
 You had it ΓÇÿtil just a minute ago!
 Hey, search for it, hurry!
 R-RightΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 Naruto! Over there.
 You blew it away the instant you set off the Rasengan!
 Hurry!
 I know!
 CΓÇÖmon, cΓÇÖmon.
 ItΓÇÖs going to hatch!
 We did it! Hurry, make it sniff thisΓÇª
 Wh-WhyΓÇª?!
 That thing just now doesnΓÇÖt count! CΓÇÖmon, sniff SasukeΓÇÖs smell!
 ItΓÇÖs all over now.
 HuhΓÇª?
 Hey! Stop! Wait!
 So you failed because you farted!
 Take responsibility!
 What are you saying that for?!
 Well thenΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªthe Bikochu, isnΓÇÖt it?
 NarutoΓÇª I found you!
 CΓÇÖmon, forgive me already, Sakura!
 No! I absolutely will not forgive you!
 ΓÇô Sakura, you look so scary! ΓÇô Come back here!
 So the mission failedΓÇª
 It seems that they succeeded at protecting the Bikochu,
 but failed at getting it to smell the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.
 I seeΓÇª Hinata must be depressed.
 This strategy was her idea, wasnΓÇÖt it?
 WellΓÇª Looks like thatΓÇÖs not the case.
 HinataΓÇª I heard that your mission failed.
 Yes. It didnΓÇÖt work at all.
 I have to train more and moreΓÇª and work harder next time!
 I-I seeΓÇª Good luck.
 MoreΓÇª
 MoreΓÇª
 MoreΓÇª
 More!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 What! Why do I have to go on such an easy mission?!
 DonΓÇÖt complain! YouΓÇÖre the one who picked up this missionΓÇÖs client!
 ThatΓÇÖs no reason! After all, IΓÇÖm busy with a lot stuff!
 ThatΓÇÖs enough, or IΓÇÖll send you back to the Academy!
 ThatΓÇÖs not fairΓÇª
 No arguments! Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto!
 The four of you, IΓÇÖm delivering your new mission.

5,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 You have to think when using Jutsu.
 They can be used against you.
 Also, don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.
 A Ninja must see through deceptionΓÇªgot it?
 I know that!
 You know, you say that because you don't get it. Listen up.
 Your movements are wasteful.
 Now!
 He finally dropped his guard!
 You're so...
 No way!
 You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it.
 Damn! Another substitutionΓÇª?
 He must have found out my location with those Shuriken!
 He purposely lowered his guard! Serves me rightΓÇª
 I fell for the trap.
 So he's over there, ehΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇªWhere are youΓÇª?!
 Don't tell me, Kakashi Sensei alreadyΓÇª
 No!
 That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!
 Safe! He didn't notice me.
 Sakura, behind you.
 Huh?!
 What's up with that ""A Ninja must see through deception"" stuff?!
 Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again!
 I fell for it again!
 You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision
 What was that?! Huh?!
 Hold on! Where's Sensei?!
 Huh?! What's going on?!
 Huh?! What's what?!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Sasuke?!
 SaΓÇªSakuΓÇªraΓÇª
 P-PleaseΓÇªhelpΓÇªmeΓÇª
 Maybe I went a bit overboardΓÇª
 But it's really something she should noticeΓÇª
 Was that voiceΓÇªSakura'sΓÇª?
 Shinobi Battle Skill ΓÖ¬2, Genjutsu.
 Sakura was easily lured.
 Genjutsu, huh...?
 An illusory mind-controlling technique. I'm not surprised she got lured.
 HoweverΓÇª
 I'm different from them.
 Why don't you say that after you get a bellΓÇªSasuke?
 It's no use just using straightforward attacks.
 A trap?!
 What?!
 This guy's...?!
 What a guy.
 There's no time to read ""Make-Out Paradise.""
 WhatΓÇª? 					IΓÇª?!
 That's right! I saw Sasuke on the verge of dying and IΓÇª
 Sasuke! Don't die and leave me here!!
 Where are you?!
 So that's what it looks like behind the logs.
 Oh! There are box lunches on the stone!
 A Ninja must see through deception... eh?
 Well! I'll acknowledge that you're different from those two.
 Horse!
 Tiger!
 Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!
 What?! That's not a Jutsu that a Genin can doΓÇª
 He shouldn't have enough Chakra yet!
 He's gone! ls he behind me?! No, above me?!
 Where is he?!
 I'm under you!!
 Wha--?!
 Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu.
 Shinobi Battle Skill ΓÖ¬3, Ninjutsu.
 How's that? You can't move, heh?
 Although, you'reΓÇªalready starting to make your mark.
 But, oh well.
 They do say that the nail that sticks up gets hammered down, soΓÇª
 Damn it!
 I don't have to naively take those bells. I'll just eat in secret right now!
 Let's eat!!
 Hey.
 I was just jokingΓÇª
 Too late!
 Darn itΓÇª! Is there this much of a difference in strengthΓÇª?
 Sakura...
 This time it's a freshly severed head?!
 What's up with her?
 Sasuke?
 You're okay!
 Hey, cut it out! Don't cling to me!
 There's not much time left until noon. I'm going.
 Sasuke, you're still going after the bells?!
 I was able to touch them last time. Next time I'll be able to take them.
 What?! 					I-I see.
 Sure enough, you're awesome, Sasuke.
 There's no way I can take the bells from Sensei.
 At this rate, I'll face separation from SasukeΓÇª
 UhΓÇªsay. There's really no time leftΓÇª
 So let's just take it easy and try again next time.
 I'm the only one who can kill that man.
 HuhΓÇª? What? You mean Sensei?
 At that timeΓÇªI was crying.
 CryingΓÇª?
 MyΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª? What is itΓÇª?
 I'm an avenger. I must become stronger than that manΓÇª
 I don't have time for setbacks here...
 ...to kill a certain man!
 Damn itΓÇªI wasted my time talking.
 Sasuke...
 Oh-oh, your stomachs are growlingΓÇª
 By the way, about this exerciseΓÇª
 Well! There's no need for you guys to go back to the Academy.
 What? IΓÇª All I did was lay unconscious.
 Is that okay?
 Love is victorious!! Cha!!
 Yahooooo!
 Then, then! That means the three of usΓÇª
 Yes. The three of youΓÇª
 must quit being Ninja!!
 N-No way!
 Kakashi hasn't passed a single person this whole timeΓÇª
 IrukaΓÇª
 Even I don't know if it's good for those kids to become Shinobi right awayΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª Kakashi's judgments were correctΓÇª
 Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?!
 Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to take the bells.
 But why do we have to be told to ""quit""?!
 That's because you're all squirts who don't have the qualifications to become Ninja.
 Oh!
 Sasuke!
 I'm saying you're squirts.
 Don't step on Sasuke!!
 Are you kids thinking that being a Ninja is easy? Huh?
 Why do you think you're doing this exercise in teams?
 Huh?! What do you mean?
 Put simplyΓÇª
 it's as if you guys have no understanding of the answer to this test.
 AnswerΓÇª?
 Yes. The answer that determines passing or failing of this test.
 That'sΓÇªwhat I've wanted to ask about for a while now.
 Man, are you guys brainless or what?
 Don't you get the meaning of the three-man squad?!
 Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?!
 That'sΓÇªteamwork!
 You mean, working together?
 Exactly. But it's too late even if you realize that now.
 You might've been able toΓÇª
 take the bells if the three of you had come at meΓÇª
 Well, it's too bad.
 Now wait a minute.
 Why use teamwork if there were only two bells?
 If the three of us were to desperately go take the bells with one having to hold back,
 that wouldn't be teamwork. That'd create internal discord.
 Of course!
 This is a test set up to purposely place you against each other.
 It's under just such conditions where one's own interests aren't the issue.
 The intention was to select those who could prioritize teamworkΓÇª
 Despite this, you foolsΓÇª
 Sakura!
 You were only concerned with Sasuke and you didn't even know where he was.
 And you didn't care for Naruto who was right in front of your eyesΓÇª
 Naruto!
 All you do is run soloΓÇª
 You labeled the other two as hindrances and acted on your ownΓÇª
 Missions are carried out in squads!
 There's no mistaking that Ninjas need unsurpassed individual skillsΓÇª
 But ""teamwork"" is considered more important than that.
 Individual actions that disrupt teamwork throw the team into crisis and lead to deathΓÇª
 For example...
 ""Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke diesΓÇª""
 What?! What?! Whaaat?!
 Is what willΓÇªhappen.
 Oh, I was so surpised.
 On top of having a hostage taken,
 you're faced with two impossible choices and end up being killed.
 Every mission is a life-risking assignment.
 Look at thisΓÇª
 The many names engraved on this stoneΓÇª
 These are all Ninjas who are called heroes in the village.
 That-that-that-that! I like thaaat!
 I've decided now to get my name engraved there, too!
 A hero! A hero! I'm not going to die like a dog!
 ButΓÇªthey're not just ordinary heroes.
 No kidding. Then, what kind of heroes are they?
 Hey! Hey!
 They are heroes who were killed in action.
 Killed in action?
 It means they died performing a mission.
 This is a memorial.
 The names of my friends are also engraved here...
 I'll give you guys one more chance!
 However, after noon it'll be a harsher battle to take the bell.
 Those who want to take on the challenge can eat lunch.
 However, don't let Naruto have any.
 It's punishment for breaking the rules and attempting to eat lunch on your own.
 If someone lets him eatΓÇª
 that person will be disqualified on the spot.
 I make the rules, here. Got it?!
 I must be going.
 Listen to me, Iruka.
 What?
 No matter what the result, don't hold it against KakashiΓÇª
 Alright.
 I'm okay with not eating lunch! No sweat at all!
 No sweatΓÇª
 Here.
 H-Hey, Sasuke. Sensei just saidΓÇª!
 It's okay. There's no sign of him now.
 The three of us are going to go take the bells together.
 It'll be trouble for me if he becomes a hindrance, so...
 SasukeΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª
 ThanksΓÇª
 Don't thank me. Just hurry up and eat.
 ButΓÇª
 I'm onΓÇªa dietΓÇª I mean I just eat less than Sasuke.
 So you don't need to worry.
 ButΓÇª
 SeeΓÇª
 Wha--?!
 Hurry it up. We don't know when he'll be backΓÇª
 It's just this one time.
 Okay? You got it?!
 I got it.
 You three!
 Yiiikes!
 You defied the rules so that means you know what's comingΓÇª
 Do you haveΓÇªsomething to say?
 But you seeΓÇª
 What?!
 But! But! But! You said, Sensei!
 These guysΓÇª
 We're a three-man squad, right?
 That's right! The three of us are one, soΓÇª!
 That's right! That's right! That's right!
 That's right!
 The three of you are one, ehΓÇª
 You pass!
 What?!
 Whaaat?!
 You pass!
 We passed?! Why?!
 You guys are the first.
 Up until now, it was always just dunces who would meekly listen to what I said.
 A Ninja must see through deceptionΓÇª
 In the world of Ninja,
 those who break rules and codes are branded as garbageΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 Those who don't cherish their friends are garbage worse than that.
 He'sΓÇª He'sΓÇªkindaΓÇªcoolΓÇª
 That's it for the exerciseΓÇª
 Everyone passes!
 Group Seven starts their mission tomorrow!
 Yes, Sir!
 I did it!! I'm a Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
 Let's go home.
 Cha!
 I...
 knew this is how it'd turn out!
 Untie the rope!
 Oh, please! It'd been nothing but blah missions until now.
 And just when I thought I'd finally gotten an awesome mission,
 to think it'd be bodyguarding this old man.
 He mocks the heck out of me, calling me a brat.
 I'll tell him a thing or two.
 Someday I'll beΓÇª Hey, are you listening?!

 Those who become Hokage are born to that fate.
 So what?!
 Lord Hyuga!
 IΓÇÖm sorry butΓÇª Could you step out for a moment?
 B-ButΓÇª
 It wonΓÇÖt take long.
 Y-Yes.
 What do you need from me?
 That dayΓÇª
 I came to tell you the truthΓÇª about that day.
 That dayΓÇª?
 At that time, I intended to die!
 W-What are you talking about?!
 That day my fatherΓÇª
 He was killed as your body double!
 The truth of that dayΓÇªis here.
 They're probably only excuses made at the convenience of the head family.
 The person you are nowΓÇª should be able to understand.
 This writingΓÇª!
 NejiΓÇª I only have a little time left.
 I want to use that limited time to convey something to youΓÇª
 Convey something to me?
 The head of Ninjas from the Land of Lightning,
 who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata, was killed by Lord HiashiΓÇª
 But the Land of Lightning didnΓÇÖt acknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,
 made only the killing of the head Ninja a problem,
 and made unreasonable demands.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped.
 With my one life, the village can be savedΓÇª
 Wait, Hiashi. DonΓÇÖt be so hasty!
 The HyugaΓÇÖs Kekkei Genkai is an important strength of this land.
 It is the duty of the head family to protect it foreverΓÇª
 However, for the sake of that dutyΓÇª
 if we involve our land in a desperate warΓÇª!
 I understand that! ThatΓÇÖs whyΓÇª
 IsnΓÇÖt that why we have branch families?
 HizashiΓÇÖs corpseΓÇª WeΓÇÖll hand it over as your body double.
 Hizashi tooΓÇª understands the situation.
 However, what they want is the secret of the power of the Byakugan.
 The point in time that Hizashi becomes a corpse,
 that power will be sealed.
 I donΓÇÖt believe that the Land of Lightning will consent to that.
 ThatΓÇÖs their true intent,
 but the condition made by Lightning is to ΓÇ£Hand over Hiashi HyugaΓÇÖs dead body.ΓÇ¥
 We pretend that we agreed to their terms,
 and hand Hizashi, who is identical to you, over...
 and they canΓÇÖt pursue it any further than that.
 B-ButΓÇª
 HiashiΓÇª The time has comeΓÇª
 Your predecessors have done the same to protect the power of Hyuga clan.
 Even siblingsΓÇª have the heart to write each other off.
 That is the fate of the head family.
 And thisΓÇªis the destiny of ones born into Hyuga!
 Where has Lord Hiashi, who is always bullish, go?
 The scale of this issue is different from the ones in the past!
 ItΓÇÖs not that easyΓÇª
 H-HizashiΓÇªyouΓÇª
 PleaseΓÇªlet me go.
 YouΓÇª YouΓÇªhave Neji.
 Why do you choose deathΓÇª for the head family?!
 ThatΓÇÖs not so!
 I have been resenting the head family.
 To tell the truth even now IΓÇÖm bitter.
 ThatΓÇÖs whyΓÇª
 I want to die protecting you as ΓÇ£my brother,ΓÇ¥ not as the head family.
 ItΓÇÖs the first time IΓÇÖve had the freedom to choose.
 IΓÇÖve only shown Neji my ugly side.
 However, now IΓÇÖve come here and finally know my own intentions.
 So please tell NejiΓÇª
 I-I wasnΓÇÖt killed to protect the head familyΓÇª
 but to protect my siblings, family and the landΓÇª
 by my own will I chose death!
 T-To choose deathΓÇª you call that freedomΓÇª?
 Big brotherΓÇª
 Once, just this once, I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.
 I wanted to choose my own fate.
 ThatΓÇÖs all.
 Overcome your own fate, NejiΓÇª
 Fate is something you work out with your own hands.
 FatherΓÇª
 This isΓÇªthe truth!
 IΓÇÖm sorry!
 PleaseΓÇªraise your head.
 FatherΓÇª
 I wonder if a personΓÇÖs destiny is only floating like a cloud in a fixed currentΓÇª
 Or is a person able to ride on the current that he chooses.
 I donΓÇÖt understand it well yet.
 Whichever, the end point might still be the sameΓÇª
 Just, when the choice is the latterΓÇª
 people turn toward the goal of living and work hard toward it.
 And those who hold that are really strong.
 I feel like I finally understand, through this battleΓÇª
 AndΓÇª fatherΓÇª
 I have only one goalΓÇª
 I want to become stronger, so I wonΓÇÖt lose to anyone.
 ThatΓÇÖs how I feel now.
 FatherΓÇªI see many birds flying. And they seem to be enjoying themselves.
 ItΓÇÖs buzzing.
 ThatΓÇÖs because it was a good battleΓÇª
 Certainly, thereΓÇÖs that too, butΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs likely that, for the curious heads of Ninja and the feudal lords,
 there is no match they look forward to more than this next match.
 By the way, it seems that he wasnΓÇÖt seen at the opening ceremonyΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs arrived here already, hasnΓÇÖt he?
 ThereΓÇÖs been no news of Sasuke.
 And thereΓÇÖs the issue of Orochimaru.
 Before everyone starts to make noise, we should disqualify himΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?! Hurry up and start the next match!
 How long are you going to make us wait!
 Before night falls!
 I wonder whatΓÇÖs going on with the next match?
 Is Sasuke here?
 SasukeΓÇª
 That guyΓÇª What in the world is he doing?!
 Is he planning not to show up?
 A wise man never courts dangerΓÇª
 A wise judgementΓÇªis it?
 What are you saying?
 HeΓÇÖll definitely come! Believe it!
 But seriously, what is he doing?
 Keep this up and heΓÇª heΓÇÖll be disqualified.
 ThereΓÇÖs no choiceΓÇª
 Sasuke isΓÇªdisqualified.
 Yes.
 Sasuke Uchiha isΓÇªdisqualified?
 It has to be done.
 What in the world are we going to do?
 If that guy doesnΓÇÖt show up, our plan of strategyΓÇª
 This isnΓÇÖt goodΓÇª
 Could he haveΓÇª?
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 IΓÇÖm going to confirm my existenceΓÇª
 Darn that GaaraΓÇª
 I wonder if he really killed himΓÇª
 Sasuke one more timeΓÇª
 What happened?
 ItΓÇÖs obvious that youΓÇÖre there standing with the thirst for blood.
 Why donΓÇÖt you come out?
 ItΓÇÖs youΓÇª
 Lord HokageΓÇª
 I want you to consider waiting a little bit for Sasuke UchihaΓÇÖs disqualification.
 I understand your point, butΓÇª
 No matter how excellent the Shinobi,
 to make light of time is not a qualification for Chunin.
 If thereΓÇÖs no clear reason to satisfy
 the heads of Ninja and feudal lords who are here,
 thereΓÇÖs no reason to wait for him!
 I seeΓÇª
 Well then, there is a sufficient reason.
 Including myselfΓÇª
 most of the heads of Ninja and feudal lords that are hereΓÇª
 came here because they want to see the next match.
 HoweverΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs the remaining survivor of the ΓÇ£Uchiha.ΓÇ¥
 Land of the Wind too, absolutely, is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.
 Lord HokageΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no guarantee that Sasuke will come butΓÇª
 All right thenΓÇª
 We shall specially postpone this match and wait.
 Lord Hokage! ReallyΓÇª
 Inform so to the Proctor!
 Y-Yes.
 HoweverΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs rare for you to insist like that, Lord Kazekage.
 WellΓÇª
 To show off the ShinobiΓÇÖs qualities of our village to the feudal lordsΓÇª
 thereΓÇÖs no better opponent than an Uchiha.
 ItΓÇÖs a chance for us as well.
 CΓÇÖmon, what happened to the match?!
 What happened to Uchiha?!
 I understandΓÇª
 Everyone! The candidate for the next battle has not arrived here!
 WeΓÇÖll briefly postpone this battle and start the following battle ahead of it.
 What is he doingΓÇªthat Sasuke?
 Great, so Sasuke didnΓÇÖt get disqualified!
 ThatΓÇÖs goodΓÇª
 Hey! That means my match is one match closer!
 Then, on to the next pair!
 Kankuro and Shino Aburame! Come down!
 My matchΓÇªdoesnΓÇÖt matter at all.
 More importantlyΓÇª
 I'd rather not expose the Mechanism of Crow to the enemy before the planΓÇª
 Proctor!
 I abstain!
 What?!
 I abstain! Please advance the matches!
 Due to KankuroΓÇÖs abstention, Shino Aburame wins by default!
 WhatΓÇÖs that all about?!
 Have a proper match!
 You areΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs my turn, isnΓÇÖt it?
 It seems that youΓÇÖre really fired up.
 Okay, letΓÇÖs go to the next match.
 Hey! The last one, come down!
 Hey! Hey! What are you doing, frivolously building things up?
 I mean, why does only my match have to be modified?
 Shikamaru Nara! You!
 DamnΓÇª lf itΓÇÖs like this IΓÇÖll abstain tooΓÇª
 CΓÇÖmon! Shikamaru, fight hard!
 Damn that NarutoΓÇª
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says ΓÇ£I LOVE YOUΓÇ¥
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 It looks a bit strange that Shikamaru is fighting in the Final Round.
 He's good, firing up, burning up! That's my teammate!
 But, doesn't he seem spaced out looking at the sky?
 He totally looks so ambitious. All right, Shikamar!
 Keep it up and 					attack hard!

 Okay! LetΓÇÖs go!
 Huh?
 ""Let's go,"" with so much energyΓÇª
 Don't act like a little kid!
 Oh? YouΓÇÖre in a bad mood.
 Because! Because! lt's in the middle of my training!
 There are three steps in the training, right?!
 IΓÇÖm only done with the second step!
 You can do the third step even while walking.
 What! Really?!
 A balloon?
 Here!
 WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª? An ordinary balloon?
 The first step is ΓÇ£Spin.ΓÇ¥ The second step is ΓÇ£Power.ΓÇ¥
 And finally, the third step is this.
 An Impossible Choice: The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart
 Which one is ΓÇ£thisΓÇ¥?!
 Watch me, it looks as if I am simply holding a balloonΓÇª
 You say it ΓÇ£looks as if,ΓÇ¥ but nothing is really happening.
 Then, I will do the same thing on my left hand.
 LetΓÇÖs see whatΓÇÖs really happening inside the balloon.
 Wow!
 The Chakra is randomly spinning and going faster and fasterΓÇª
 But still, itΓÇÖs perfectly roundΓÇª ltΓÇÖs almost likeΓÇª
 Like a small typhoon, right?
 WhatΓÇÖs happening in your left handΓÇª
 is happening inside that balloon in your right hand, too?
 Yeah! ThatΓÇÖs right.
 CoolΓÇª
 The balloon isnΓÇÖt moving at all even if heΓÇÖs spinning that much ChakraΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs more power than that time the rubber ball popped,
 and itΓÇÖs spinning a lot more too!
 Listen, in this third step,
 youΓÇÖve got to use 100% of what you have learnedΓÇª
 and retain them.
 In other words, while keeping the ΓÇ£SpinΓÇ¥ and the ΓÇ£PowerΓÇ¥ at their max,
 imagine creating a single layer within the balloon
 and compressing the Chakra within it.
 Got it!
 So, this training is about keeping
 the spin and power that I did in the second step,
 and conversely, trying not to pop a delicate balloon!
 Oh! ThatΓÇÖs the most perceptive you've been so far!
 Huh?
 But, whatΓÇÖs the point in going to all the trouble?!
 In short, it means this.
 Watch! ItΓÇÖs like this up until the second step of the training.
 Next, after you have mastered the third step!
 This is what happens!
 If you can keep this small typhoon the size of your palm,
 the force wonΓÇÖt disperse.
 The spinning gets faster and faster
 and the power gets more and more compressed.
 And the destructive power will reach its max.
 Well, so, thatΓÇÖs that.
 All right! IΓÇÖll do this, too!
 Okay, this feels rightΓÇª
 Now!
 Retain it here!
 RetainΓÇª
 RetainΓÇª
 No cutting-corners!
 YouΓÇÖve got to put out 100% spin and power, and retain them.
 You gotta be kiddingΓÇª
 Unless I can perfectly control all my power, itΓÇÖs impossible!
 Now I can see itΓÇª
 This third stepΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs on a totally different level compared to the others.
 I told youΓÇª
 With an achievement difficulty of Rank A, itΓÇÖs a super advanced Ninjutsu.
 Well, IΓÇÖm done explaining! WeΓÇÖll continue as we go on walking.
 Hey, hey!
 We donΓÇÖt need to rush so much, until I can properlyΓÇª
 We have already wasted enough time waiting for your body to recover.
 ThereΓÇÖs no guarantee that Tsunade stays in this town much longer.
 What?!
 But, butΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not like an old acquaintance is going to conveniently pop up
 and start talking about the good old times with herΓÇª
 Come on, letΓÇÖs go!
 All rightΓÇª
 Long time no seeΓÇªOrochimaru.
 IΓÇÖd looked for you everywhere.
 What do you want from me after so long a time?
 You arenΓÇÖt thinking of talking about the old daysΓÇª?
 Actually, I need to ask you for a little favorΓÇª
 His heartbeat is fastΓÇª
 From that complexion, he must have a high fever.
 He must have been fatigued for quite some timeΓÇª
 And that armΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade.
 You must have understood by now.
 Go to someone else, I donΓÇÖt treat anyone any more.
 That wonΓÇÖt doΓÇª
 You must know how serious this wound isΓÇª
 No one can treat this wound.
 Except for one of the Legendary ΓÇ£SanninΓÇ¥
 who won her fame as a medical specialist, Princess TsunadeΓÇª
 YouΓÇª
 That armΓÇª itΓÇÖs not an ordinary wound.
 A special Sealing Jutsu or somethingΓÇª?
 What have you done?
 Well, it just happenedΓÇª when I killed the Third Hokage.
 YouΓÇª Really?
 Humph. DonΓÇÖt look so scary.
 Anything that has a form will one day decayΓÇª
 Same goes for humans.
 You must already know that too.
 For you have let two of your most beloved ones dieΓÇª
 Let two of the most beloved ones die?
 I seeΓÇª He thinks of terrible things.
 That was a really terrible way to dieΓÇª
 You!
 PoisonedΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs fast!
 Get out of my way!
 WonΓÇÖt let you!
 Calm down, Shizune!
 This attendantΓÇªis an expert.
 OrochimaruΓÇª
 Your personality's been like this for a long time.
 And you know my personality very wellΓÇª
 So stop fooling around with me.
 IΓÇÖll kill you, bastard!
 SheΓÇÖs powerfulΓÇª
 And so scaryΓÇª she definitely must be single.
 Tsunade is impatient and short-temperedΓÇª
 Hey Naruto, thereΓÇÖs no time to be falling.
 If we donΓÇÖt hurry,
 who knows where that shrew will disappear again.
 Hey you, Pervy Sage!
 ThatΓÇÖs no way to speak to a hard-working apprentice!
 Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now, not you.
 Well, what the heck!
 To have this Pervy Sage come all the way to meet herΓÇª
 Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?
 Hope sheΓÇÖs still hereΓÇª
 We didnΓÇÖt come here to fight.
 We just want to negotiate with you!
 Negotiate?
 Yes.
 DonΓÇÖt make me laugh!
 IΓÇÖve already told you once. Get out of my sight!
 We canΓÇÖt do that.
 Get out of my sight.
 You are the only one who can treat Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs arm.
 Get out of my sight.
 WeΓÇÖre not asking you to do it for free.
 LetΓÇÖs make a deal!
 IΓÇÖll count up to five. Leave before IΓÇÖm done.
 Or else, IΓÇÖll make you disappear myself.
 Please calm down. lt wonΓÇÖt be a bad deal for youΓÇª
 FiveΓÇª
 FourΓÇª
 ThreeΓÇª
 TwoΓÇª
 OneΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you lovedΓÇª
 with the Forbidden Jutsu IΓÇÖve developed.
 Since we havenΓÇÖt disappeared yet,
 IΓÇÖm guessing that the deal is made?
 Yes. I do know this young ladyΓÇª
 Really?
 Yeah.
 To win back the money she lost here, I think she saidΓÇª
 she was going over there.
 SpinΓÇª PowerΓÇª
 Letting them out to their max and retain itΓÇª
 Hey, kid.
 Hmm?
 Wanna gamble a bit, too?
 Over there? Where is that?
 Hmm?
 See, if the total number of the pips on these dices
 comes out as even numbers, thatΓÇÖs ΓÇ£ChoΓÇ¥
 and if itΓÇÖs odd, thatΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Han.ΓÇ¥
 Shut up! I am training right now, donΓÇÖt bug me!
 What nonsense! This is a gambling house.
 Instead of that balloon, letΓÇÖs play with these.
 No way! I donΓÇÖt have any time to be playing with those dice!
 Ha, what a boring kid!
 Shut up!
 SoΓÇªcan you tell me where that is?
 Well, you canΓÇÖt expect things to be free in a gambling house, you know?
 OkayΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs make a deal. The information will be free if you winΓÇª
 And if you lose, IΓÇÖll give it to you for 1000 ryo.
 All right!
 So choose, odd or even!
 Okay! Here we goΓÇª
 Well, soΓÇª since I am exactly 50 years old.
 IΓÇÖll go forΓÇªeven!
 If itΓÇÖs odd, I winΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll open it now.
 Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!
 W-What the heck--?!
 1000 ryoΓÇª
 Nice, Naruto!
 Looks like I wonΓÇª
 Darn! It didnΓÇÖt work again!
 RetainΓÇª
 Where shall I look next?
 Geez, sheΓÇÖs nowhere to be found!
 Hm? Me?
 Lotto?
 Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.
 Come and play with this fun, fun Lotto.
 ThereΓÇÖs one that you know the result right away.
 Which one do you want?
 Really, you are so much cuter being chubby!
 I canΓÇÖt believe he won with just one draw.
 HeΓÇÖs very talented in thisΓÇª
 though his talent in Jutsu is still immature.
 WellΓÇªanyhowΓÇª
 Where could have Tsunade gone?
 She couldnΓÇÖt have gone that far in this short amount of time.
 I guess weΓÇÖll have to search for her from a higher place.
 If I remember it correctly, this is a castle town.
 If we go up to the castleΓÇª
 Naruto! This way!
 DonΓÇÖt you want to see those twoΓÇª Tsunade?
 NawakiΓÇªDanΓÇª
 If I treat your arms, what do you intend to do with them?
 Well, I donΓÇÖt like to lieΓÇª
 So, I will tell you the truth.
 Hey, hey! Where is the castle?
 ItΓÇÖs not thereΓÇª?
 In addition to getting what I wantΓÇª
 This time, I will completely destroy the Leaf Village!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Hey, enough already!
 Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!
 Who cares if she is the legendary Kunoichi?!
 Who cares if she's the medical specialist?!
 There's no way I'll accept this person as the new Hokage!
 If she belittles the Third and Fourth HokagesΓÇª
 I don't care if she's the candidate to be the Fifth Hokage!
 I'll kick her butt!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark

 Well, for the time being, their applications will pass.
 Yeah...
 It appears this year's test-takers will be amusing.

 Don't pull.
 SasukeΓÇª Sasuke Uchiha, eh.
 Does that kid concern you?
 HmphΓÇª
 Lee, let's go.
 What're you doing?
 You guys go on ahead. I have something I want to check out.
 What's that about?
 Why should I know?
 You, with the unpleasant look. Wait a minute!
 Huh?
 ΓÇô Oh! 					ΓÇô Yikes!
 What is it?
 Why don't you fight with me here now?
 Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!
 A fight here nowΓÇª?
 Yes.
 My name's Rock Lee.
 When asking a person their name,
 I'm supposed to give my own name first, right?
 Sasuke UchihaΓÇª
 HmphΓÇª So you knew?
 I want to fight with you!
 I want to test out how effective my techniques will be
 against the descendant of the clan reputed for genius Ninjas.
 AlsoΓÇª
 Sakura. Love.
 Noooo! Those lower eyelashes are awful!
 The hairstyle is awful, too!
 Those bushy eyebrows, just too intense!
 Everything is...!
 You're an angel!
 Noooooo!
 You are good at it. Then, how about...?
 Really... That was super close.
 You! Don't throw strange stuff!
 I was dodging for my life!
 You don't have to resent me that much.
 It's Sasuke again! Darn it! Darn it!
 To be honest, you're a naive one,
 knowing the name of Uchiha and challenging me.
 Do you want to realize what this name is , Bushy-Brow?
 I insist.
 I'm lucky...
 to be able to have a bout with the number one rookie right away.
 And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!
 Wait!
 I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
 Hey, youΓÇª!
 Big deal.
 I'll be able to take care of him in just five minutes!
 The one I want to fight isn't youΓÇª lt's Uchiha.
 All these peopleΓÇª
 keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke. How annoying!
 Darn it!
 Leaf Whirlwind!
 As I thought, he's strongΓÇª
 I declare. You are absolutely no match for me.
 BecauseΓÇª
 among the Leaf Village Genin, I'm the strongest now.
 He stopped my kickΓÇª
 What's with that Chakra in his armΓÇª?
 Interesting. I'll do it.
 OhΓÇª
 Stop! Sasuke!
 There's less than thirty minutes until the 3:00 registration.
 Don't worry.
 It'll be over in five minutes.
 Here he comes!
 I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.
 I may end up breaking the taboo.
 I may end up usingΓÇª that technique!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 I can't get completely out of the wayΓÇª
 Guard!
 WhatΓÇª?!
 Sasuke!
 W-What's going on?
 ButΓÇªhe did guard himself just now, no mistake.
 He got around my guard.
 What is it?
 Is it NinjutsuΓÇª? Or is it GenjutsuΓÇª?!
 As I thought, he's going to get up!
 HmphΓÇª That's okay.
 If that's the case,
 this is a good opportunity to get used to THAT.
 I'll do it.
 Huh?! C-Could that beΓÇª?
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke, when has he... Why is that in his eyesΓÇª
 And in both eyesΓÇª!
 Is that the Sharingan?
 Sasuke's awesome, after all!
 If this is the same Kekkei Genkai as Kakashi Sensei'sΓÇª
 he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!
 Genjutsu or NinjutsuΓÇª
 It's some kind of magic either wayΓÇª I'll reveal that!
 It feels like Sasuke's rapidly getting stronger.
 That's to be expected of the Uchiha clan.
 That's rightΓÇª Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.
 Huh?!
 The SharinganΓÇª!
 To not be able to discern the Jutsu with the SharinganΓÇª
 Could it beΓÇªthat his technique isΓÇª!
 That's rightΓÇª
 My technique is neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu.
 S-Sasuke!
 That's right!
 My technique is mere TaijutsuΓÇªSasuke.
 You may not be able to believe it just like that, butΓÇª
 Punk!
 It's said that the Sharingan has the ability to spot
 all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.
 Make no mistake,
 the Sharingan reads Ninjutsu and Genjutsu that
 require the principle of building up Chakra and weaving Signs,
 and can most surely handle such Jutsu.
 However, only Taijutsu is a little bit differentΓÇª
 W-What do you mean?!
 Even if you can spot my movements with the Sharingan,
 your body is not equipped with the speed to respond to my Taijutsu.
 In other words, even if you understand with your eyes,
 there's nothing you can do if your body can't keep up.
 Do you know?
 There are two types of strong people, genius-types and effort-types.
 If your Sharingan is a genius-type drawing Uchiha abilityΓÇª
 I'm an effort-type who has patiently mastered only Taijutsu.
 In a manner of speaking,
 your Sharingan and my ultimate Taijutsu have the worst compatibilityΓÇª
 Guard!
 Huh?! Dancing Leaf ShadowΓÇª!
 And I shall prove it with this technique.
 Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
 W-What's he going to doΓÇª?!
 It's my victory!
 Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!
 And I shall prove it with this technique.
 Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
 W-What's he going to doΓÇª?!
 It's my victory!
 Huh?!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 That'sΓÇª!
 That's as far as it goes! Lee!
 W-What is itΓÇª? What's going on?
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke was beaten?!
 What happened while I was knocked out?!
 Are you okay?! Sasuke.
 He's agitatedΓÇª To think he couldn't fall properly.
 Y-You were watchingΓÇª?
 Lee! That technique just now is prohibited, you know!
 W-What's with that turtleΓÇª?
 I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean toΓÇª
 He'sΓÇªgetting scolded or somethingΓÇª
 Could that beΓÇªBushy-Brow's teacher?!
 B-But, of course,
 I didn't even remotely have a mind to use the Hidden techniqueΓÇª
 There's no mistake!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Hey-hey.
 WhatΓÇª?
 That thingΓÇª It's a turtle, rightΓÇª? Right?
 Isn't it obvious?!
 Say! Say! Can even a turtle become a Ninja teacher?
 I don't know!
 Fool!
 You think such subterfuge will work?!
 You should know very well what it means
 for a Shinobi to give away his technique!
 IΓÇªI know.
 To think I lost to someone so flippantΓÇª
 Have you prepared yourself?
 Y-Yes sirΓÇª
 All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!
 Man! Life treating you good, huh?
 Huh?!
 Whoaaa! An even more intense guy has appeared!
 Yo, Lee!
 Super intense. The extreme bowl cut...
 T-Those are some incredibly raging browsΓÇª
 I've never seen anything like that in my life.
 H-Hey! You guys! Don't mock Guy Sensei!
 Shut up!
 I'm at a loss for a reaction because
 of those bizarre things appearing one after another!
 What?!
 Hey, Lee! Drop it!
 Yes, sirΓÇª
 Idiot!
 Lee, youΓÇªyouΓÇª
 S-SenseiΓÇª!
 L-LeeΓÇª
 SenseiΓÇªIΓÇªIΓÇª
 Enough, Lee! Don't say anything!
 Sensei!
 Lee!
 I lost to a guy like thatΓÇª
 YesΓÇªthis is adolescence!
 Sensei!
 That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.
 I-Idiot! That's dangerous! Very dangerous!
 It's okay, Lee!
 Mistakes come with adolescence. Don't worry about it!
 You're so kindΓÇªSensei!
 Now then, take a hundred laps around the Training Field toward that setting sun!
 Yes! Sensei!
 Let's go!
 Yes, sir!
 Hey, wait a minute.
 We're still in the middle of the conversation!
 What're you going to do about the Chunin Exam?!
 There's no time!
 Huh? Oh, that's rightΓÇª
 Lee, you will be punished for attempting to break the prohibition on top of fightingΓÇª
 in principle, after the Chunin Exam.
 Okay!
 Five hundred howls of adolescence!
 Yes, sir!
 IdiotsΓÇª
 Say! Say!
 By the way, what's with that turtle?
 If I'm not mistaken, those kids areΓÇª
 Kakashi'sΓÇª
 Oh! No, he's looking this way!
 You guysΓÇªhow's Kakashi Sensei?
 You know KakashiΓÇª?
 I know him all too well.
 People call usΓÇª eternal rivals.
 Sounds like a lie!
 What're you saying?! Guy Sensei really isΓÇª
 That's fine.
 ""Action speaks louder than words"" anyway.
 Huh?!
 By the way, my record is fifty wins and forty-nine losses.
 Huh?!
 This guyΓÇª
 When did he...?
 One thing, I'm stronger than KakashiΓÇª
 N-No wayΓÇª
 He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi! ls he humanΓÇª?!
 How about that?! Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!
 Darn itΓÇª
 This time around, Lee caused the trouble.
 Out of consideration for my face, forgive him.
 Out of consideration for this pleasant face.
 He's better than that KakashiΓÇª?
 Darn it! He'sΓÇª
 not just all talkΓÇª
 You guys and Lee should probably go to the classroom pretty soon.
 He...!
 Then, do your best, Lee! Farewell!
 Yes, sir.
 What?!
 SasukeΓÇª
 I have one last thing to tell you.
 I actually came here to verify my own ability.
 I lied before.
 The strongest man of the Leaf Village Genin might be on my team.
 I'm entering in order to defeat that person.
 And, you are one of my targets.
 Please prepare yourself for the Exam!
 SasukeΓÇª
 Ha! SoΓÇª
 I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?
 Naruto!
 Shut up!
 I'll knock him flat next time!
 Ha! That from someone who just got whipped.
 HeyΓÇªwhat's your problem?! Naruto, you!
 You saw it, didn't you? His handΓÇª
 That Bushy-Brow probably did a heck of a lot of special training.
 Day after dayΓÇª
 More than you haveΓÇª
 That's all it is.
 SasukeΓÇª
 InterestingΓÇª
 Hmph!
 It's starting to get interestingΓÇª the Chunin Exam!
 What's next?
 Yeah!
 All right!
 Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!
 Yeah!
 Whoaaaa! There are tons of people here!
 Are they all here to take the Chunin Exam?
 Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?
 So you're all here, too?
 Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!
 Open up your eyes and watch me become the Hokage!

186,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Laughing Shino
 Shino! 					LetΓÇÖs rest a little!
 IΓÇÖm tired from doing nothing but walk since this morning, believe it!
 YouΓÇÖre okay while you can say you are tired.
 ItΓÇÖs because you still have energy left to talk.
 Nothing but quibbling as usualΓÇª
 Man, IΓÇÖm unlucky.
 To be stuck on a mission alone with Shino.
 Hey, old lady.
 Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead?
 Are you going to Motoyoshi Village?
 Yeah!
 Then youΓÇÖll be right there once you cross this path.
 Really? Thank goodness.
 But exercise great cautionΓÇª
 Huh?
 Dead people also laugh in Motoyoshi VillageΓÇª
 It will be all over if youΓÇÖre lured into laughing.
 Naruto.
 ItΓÇÖs Motoyoshi Village.
 We never imagined it at this timeΓÇª
 To think that in this villageΓÇª
 an incident too terrifying to even talk about would occurΓÇª
 In Mourning
 IΓÇÖm Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner.
 IΓÇÖm Shino Aburame.
 IΓÇÖm Naruto Uzumaki!
 Will 		Getting right down to businessΓÇª
 This is the will of my father, Tobei Kagetsu.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu,
 shall inherit the entire Kagetsu family estateΓÇª
 HOWEVERΓÇª
 A funeral is to be held tomorrow in Motoyoshi Village
 for the head of the Kagetsu family that owns that stretch of mountains.
 IΓÇÖd like you two to go.
 Funeral security, huh? Naruto canΓÇÖt do it.
 What do you mean?!
 ItΓÇÖs because you have the most inappropriate face
 in the Leaf Village.
 Say what?!
 I think so as well.
 But thereΓÇÖs nobody else.
 So I reluctantly decided to add Naruto.
 YouΓÇÖll be the main guy on this mission, Shino.
 You're probably the best suited for this mission.
 Huh?
 As it happens,
 thereΓÇÖs one more important mission in addition to security.
 YouΓÇÖll understand when you see the will.
 However, in the event that Futa raises his voice in laughter at the funeral,
 he shall lose inheriting rights and upon consultation,
 the estate shall be divided up between the bereaved family members excluding Futa.
 This will doesnΓÇÖt make any sense at allΓÇª
 An abundance of medicinal herbs can be picked in the mountains
 owned by the Kagetsu family.
 I would have no trouble getting by for the rest of my life
 if I were to inherit the estate.
 But all that will all go down the drain just by laughing at the funeral!
 ThereΓÇÖs no doubt that the relatives will be in a frenzy
 trying to get me to laugh tomorrow.
 To be honest,
 I donΓÇÖt have the confidence to withstand it.
 But there is one salvation!
 According to the will,
 itΓÇÖs acceptable if I, the chief mourner, were to appoint a substitute!
 And so I commissioned the Leaf!
 I asked for someone who absolutely will not laugh!
 This is no doubt the perfect mission for Shino.
 IΓÇÖve never seen this guy laugh before.
 Indeed, I leave it to you.
 I understand.
 Big Brother, dinnerΓÇÖs ready.
 This is my little sister Mai, the youngest.
 She lived together with my father in this large home.
 She was also the one at his deathbed during his final moments.
 Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.
 Nice to meet youΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs eat!
 Wait!
 First, IΓÇÖll taste for poison.
 Taste for poisonΓÇª?!
 I donΓÇÖt think there would be anyone among the relatives
 who would go that farΓÇª
 But you can never be too careful.
 YouΓÇÖve got a point.
 Will you be all right, Shino?
 No problem. Even if it did contain poison,
 the Parasitic Insects in my body will dissolve it for me.
 ParasiticΓÇªlnsects?
 How is it?
 It's all rightΓÇª
 ShinoΓÇªlaughed?!
 He seems to be in very high spirits. Which means the food is fineΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt eat!
 Shino laughing like this is definitely strange, believe it!
 ThereΓÇÖs a laughing drug in this food!
 Who cooked the food?
 I did.
 But the back door isnΓÇÖt lockedΓÇª
 So anyone could get in if they wanted to.
 To think there would be someone in the family
 who would go so far as to poison!
 Oh, noΓÇªThe drug has gotten to the insects!
 No goodΓÇª They canΓÇÖt dissolve the drug.
 Then what will we do about the funeral tomorrow?!
 This is a sight that doesnΓÇÖt seem of this world, believe it!
 Naruto!
 Even if we were to contact the village now,
 we wouldnΓÇÖt be in timeΓÇª for the funeralΓÇª
 So Naruto!
 YouΓÇª
 will have to participate in the funeral as the chief mournerΓÇÖs substitute!
 No wayΓÇª
 Naruto.
 IΓÇÖm very uneasy, but IΓÇÖll be counting on you.
 IΓÇÖm also very uneasy, believe itΓÇª
 Will you knock it off?! I canΓÇÖt sleep!
 YouΓÇÖre early, Tsukiko.
 YouΓÇÖre already here, huh?
 ItΓÇÖs dadΓÇÖs funeral, after all. I came here in great haste.
 WhoΓÇÖs that kid?
 This is Naruto whom IΓÇÖve asked to be my substitute as chief mourner
 since IΓÇÖm not feeling so well.
 Nice to meet you!
 ThatΓÇÖs how itΓÇÖs going to be, so I will be leaving just with the greetings.
 I see. But it sure is a troublesome will.
 To think you canΓÇÖt inherit the estate if you laugh at the funeralΓÇª
 Be careful.
 SheΓÇÖs my immediate younger sister in question, Tsukiko.
 Five years ago, she married into the next village overΓÇª
 But sheΓÇÖs probably the one after this estate the most.
 That kid will be a cinch.
 Each and every one of themΓÇª looks greedyΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 The monk has arrived.
 Why choose a monk like this, of all people?
 I have no knowledge of this!
 ItΓÇÖs a different person from the monk at the meeting.
 DonΓÇÖt laughΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt laughΓÇª
 LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª
 Now then, allow me to begin.
 What was that sound?
 WasnΓÇÖt it the wind blowing?
 Naruto, did you not raise your voice and laugh just now?
 No, I didnΓÇÖt! I didnΓÇÖt laugh at all, believe it!
 Mai, you heard it, right?
 I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 I only heard the sound of barrels falling over.
 Well, fine.
 The funeral has only just begun.
 There are still plenty of chancesΓÇª
 After all, the opponent is this kid with a stupid look.
 IΓÇÖm savedΓÇª
 Shino, huh? Thanks!
 That was a close shaveΓÇª
 In order, please.
 Then IΓÇÖll go first.
 LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª
 No goodΓÇª He wonΓÇÖt laugh at that...
 IΓÇÖll give it one more push.
 DonΓÇÖt laughΓÇª!
 I must not laugh!
 This kid is nothing.
 IΓÇÖll kill him with laughter with that technique of mineΓÇª
 This guy also intends on doing something, huh?
 No matter what he does, no way will I laugh!
 Kiyoyasu!
 ΓÇôKiyoyasu! 					ΓÇôKiyoyasu isΓÇª
 Here it comesΓÇª
 Whatever he hits me with. IΓÇª!
 I must not laugh!
 LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª
 A flower came outΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt laughΓÇª!
 LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt laugh, donΓÇÖt laugh, donΓÇÖt laughΓÇª
 LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª LaughΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt laughΓÇªno matter what!
 HeΓÇÖs pretty toughΓÇª
 But how long can he hold on for?
 WeΓÇÖll make him laugh by the time the funeral ends without fail!
 ThatΓÇªold womanΓÇª
 Dead people also laugh in Motoyoshi VillageΓÇª
 It will be all over if youΓÇÖre lured into laughing.
 WhatΓÇÖs she doing in a place like this?
 WhoΓÇÖs there?!
 Uh, oh!
 Oh, itΓÇÖs you MaiΓÇª
 With this, itΓÇÖs over! WeΓÇÖll put this in everyoneΓÇÖs tea!
 ButΓÇª
 Everything will go well with this!
 I donΓÇÖt know about that.
 WhoΓÇÖre you?!
 ShinoΓÇª
 I heard everythingΓÇª
 How frustratingΓÇª
 If this guy would just laugh, IΓÇÖd get some of the estateΓÇª
 Thank you indeed for today. Allow me to thank you allΓÇª
 in place of the chief mourner.
 With this, the mission is completeΓÇª
 It looks like it will somehow end all right.
 Once the monk goes home, the funeral will be over.
 Please wait!
 Please let my husband say thank you as well. Okay, dear.
 Hi! Thanks for coming today.
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs he going to do?!
 It was a very nice funeral. I was so moved!
 ItΓÇÖs tear-jerking.
 That TsukikoΓÇª To think she would go this far.
 Naruto, if you can get through this, it will be over.
 Please withstand itΓÇª!
 It doesnΓÇÖt hurt at all!
 I must remember something sad at a time like this!
 Why do I think of the Pervy Sage at a time like this?!
 All right, now is the time to finish him off.
 This is awful! The tears are causing my face to collapse.
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?
 Your faceΓÇªis right here!
 N-No!
 Oh, noΓÇª
 Yes!
 What?
 DΓÇôDadΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre alive? Dad?!
 Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister!
 Dad hates fighting!
 IΓÇÖve thought up a good joke.
 IΓÇÖve thought up a good joke, too.
 WhoΓÇÖre those kidsΓÇª? WhereΓÇÖd they come from?
 IΓÇÖd get dad to laugh, first!
 I will be the first! You stay out of it!
 Stop it! FightingΓÇÖs wrong!
 ItΓÇÖs as Mai says. FightingΓÇÖs wrong! Wrong.
 Futa! Tsukiko!
 ΓÇôFuta?! 					ΓÇôTsukiko?!
 N-Now that you mention itΓÇª
 YeahΓÇªThey are indeed us from our childhood!
 Oh, fightingΓÇÖs wrong! A kettleΓÇÖs a kettle!
 My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins!
 Groping is wrong! Hot sake is where itΓÇÖs at.
 My wifeΓÇÖs secret stash is kept in a safe.
 Between my legsΓÇª
 Ding, dong, ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Ding-dong.
 ΓÇôThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª ΓÇôDing-dong. Ding-dong.
 ΓÇôWhen we were kidsΓÇª ΓÇôDing. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 ΓÇôDad made us laugh a lot ΓÇôDing-dong-ding.
 ΓÇôwith his silly jokesΓÇª ΓÇôDing-dong.
 ΓÇôltΓÇÖs been a long time ΓÇôDing. Ding.
 ΓÇôsince I laughed at dadΓÇÖs jokesΓÇª ΓÇôDong-dong-dong. Dong
 ΓÇôDong-dong ΓÇôThis is it! This is what I wanted to see!
 Dad!
 Then whoΓÇÖs this?
 The laughter stopped.
 Shino!
 IΓÇÖm sorry, everyone!
 But I didnΓÇÖt think youΓÇÖd all come if it werenΓÇÖt my funeralΓÇª
 Mai helped me out a bunch and this was the plan.
 Is that really you, Dad? YouΓÇÖre alive.
 WhyΓÇÖd you do this?!
 In the old days, before we knew that
 the medicinal herbs we could pick in the mountains would be profitableΓÇª
 We were poorΓÇª
 But we were bursting with laughter.
 However, we got rich from selling the medicinal herbs at a high price.
 And when weΓÇÖd open our mouths,
 weΓÇÖd start saying, ΓÇ£Money! Money! Money!ΓÇ¥
 And the smiles vanished from everyoneΓÇÖs faces.
 I wanted everyone to remember whatΓÇÖs important.
 I wanted to get back the familyΓÇÖs smiling faces!
 If I wrote that ridiculous will,
 everyone would do stupid things trying to get Futa to laugh.
 And then not only Futa, but everyone would laugh and have funΓÇª
 Happiness isnΓÇÖt money!
 ItΓÇÖs living while getting along with everyone and laughing!
 I rememberΓÇª
 Sure enough, laughter is important.
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 To be honest, IΓÇÖm sick of living at the mercy of money.
 You liar! YouΓÇÖre the one saying money this and money that the most.
 There are different kinds of ΓÇ£money,ΓÇ¥ and what I was talking about wasΓÇª
 This bell.
 Could that beΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs the laughing drug.
 ItΓÇÖs still at experimental stage, though.
 If I made it okay to appoint a substitute chief mourner,
 Futa would summon someone who definitely wouldnΓÇÖt laugh.
 So I tested it out on that person first.
 I was going to make everyone laugh by putting this in everyoneΓÇÖs tea
 if nobody had laughed by the end of the funeral.
 ButΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no point to laughter using a drugΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs because the people wouldnΓÇÖt be laughing
 from the bottom of their hearts.
 Instead, theyΓÇÖd be crying in their heartsΓÇª
 Like me right now!
 So at the end of the day, what happened with the mission?
 It's probably a success.
 ItΓÇÖs because the Lady Hokage probably knew about the real mission.
 Say-say.
 You transformed into that old man, right?
 Then the ΓÇ£Between my legs, ding-dong-dingΓÇ¥ thing was something youΓÇª
 Forget about that.
 Absolutely forget about that.
 O-Okay, got it.
 Then, fine.
 Sure enough, IΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt get used to this guyΓÇª
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.

 The mission this time around is a commission from the Land of Greens
 and is protection for some traveling merchants.
 This is just a D-rank mission.
 DonΓÇÖt complain. The castle lord there is a benefactor of mine.
 Make sure you do nothing wrong.
 I could manage a mission like that asleep, believe it.
 Very well.
 However, IΓÇÖve got an important reminder for you.
 Reminder?
 Make sure you donΓÇÖt forget to take this with you to the site.
 That is all.

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning

 donΓÇÖt trust him if he looks like your teammate.
 Just like now thereΓÇÖs a possibility
 that an enemy will transform to get close to us!
 Yeah.
 So what do we do?
 WeΓÇÖll decide on a password.
 Password?
 IΓÇÖll only say it once so listen closely.
 You ask Ninja song, ΓÇ£Ninja Chance.ΓÇ¥
 And the answer is this:
 ΓÇ£It is a chance to sneak up where a large  number of enemies are making a scene.
 ΓÇ£The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 ΓÇ£It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 ΓÇ£The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.ΓÇ¥

 Awesome!

 I know you tried to be cool and intended to rescue us, butΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt put your nose in this!
 Escape!
 This thingΓÇª SheΓÇÖs on a far different level!
 Seems like you brought that giant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.
 No matter how you look, she looks like a snakeΓÇª
 I get it, it was the handiwork of this woman.
 The situation has never gotten any better with him showing up for the rescue.
 But what should I doΓÇª?
 Hey hey hey! Evidently youΓÇÖve been bullying the weakling!
 Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here,
 IΓÇÖm going to wipe the floor with you!
 Darn it! If it continues like this, all three of us are done for!
 What should I do?
 Sasuke...
 ItΓÇÖs no good.
 This is the only way.
 Wait.
 Hmm?
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 If itΓÇÖs the scroll you want, IΓÇÖll give it to you.
 IΓÇÖm asking you. Just take this and go.
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, Sasuke! What are you doing?
 Why are you giving our scroll to the enemy?
 You, shut up!
 What ΓÇª?!
 I seeΓÇª 					YouΓÇÖre sensible.
 The only thing the ΓÇ£preyΓÇ¥ can hope for from the ΓÇ£predatorΓÇ¥ is
 presenting other food and pray you would be spared, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Take it.
 Wha--?!
 You! DonΓÇÖt interfere with this!
 DonΓÇÖt you understand this situation?!
 What're you doing all of a sudden?!
 As for me,  I donΓÇÖt remember the passwordΓÇª
 So I got no way to make sure.
 But you, youΓÇÖre an imposter Sasuke,  arenΓÇÖt you?
 Naruto!
 W-What are you trying to start?!
 You loser! 					IΓÇÖm the real me!
 Liar.
 This, this stupid coward is... absolutely... not the Sasuke I know!
 I donΓÇÖt know how strong she is but,
 how can you be sure that sheΓÇÖll let us go if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!
 YouΓÇÖre the one who choked and doesnΓÇÖt understand this situation!
 Naruto.
 ThatΓÇÖs correct.
 The Scroll.
 I could just kill you and seize it.
 DonΓÇÖt mess with me!
 Run, Naruto! Stop it!
 Darn it!
 IΓÇÖve lost confidence in you, Sasuke!
 Summoning Jutsu!

 There are three corpses.
 This is some kind of Ninja Art, isnΓÇÖt itΓÇª ?

 Yes, sir!
 If youΓÇÖre going to have dumplings, youΓÇÖve got to have sweet red bean soup.
 Okay... Once IΓÇÖve eaten this,
 I should break through and go wait at the tower for the kids.
 With this program, the quick kids should clear it soon.
 The Leaf Village mark, perfect!
 We have a problem, Ms. Anko!
 Huh? What, so suddenly?
 Corpses! Three of them!
 Moreover, theyΓÇÖre strange.
 Anyway, please come!
 Strange?
 I checked their possessions and identification,
 Ninjas from Grass Village registered in the Chunin Exam, butΓÇª
 As you can see...
 They have no faces.
 Yes.
 TheyΓÇÖre smooth and flat, like they melted away.
 Without a doubt...
 This Jutsu is...
 that manΓÇÖs...
 Why is he at this testΓÇª?
 Show me the ID photos of these three Grass Village Ninjas.
 ItΓÇÖs on their applications.
 Yes!
 So this oneΓÇÖs face was robbed.
 Then, at that time it was alreadyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll returnΓÇª the Kunai knife.

 Starting now, IΓÇÖm going to follow these guys!
 Got it?
 Yes!

 Sasuke.
 Now whatΓÇÖs your move?!
 Sasuke!
 I have to hurry.
 I get this...
 bad feeling.
 Hey.  Are you hurt?
 Scaredy cat?!
 Naruto!
 Hey!
 Are you hurt...
 Scaredy cat?
 Sasuke!
 This stupid coward is absolutely not the Sasuke I know!
 Huh?!
 Darn it! 					Let me go!
 You stupid snake!

 But  now... youΓÇÖre in the way.
 HeΓÇÖs gonna fall as it is!
 Naruto!
 What happened Sasuke?!
 SasukeΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇÖs certainly different from you, Sasuke.
 HeΓÇÖs a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
 But heΓÇÖs not in the least a coward!

 You foolish little brother.
 If you want to kill me, resent me, hate me andΓÇª
 continue to live your ugly life.
 Flee.
 Flee and hang on to your life.
 No!
 Just what I expect of the Uchiha clanΓÇª his blood has begun to stirΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 I should take my time and confirm his true power.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm an avenger.
 To defeat my brother, today I have to survive!
 But how can a person who won't risk his life in a situation like this
 beat my brother?
 Calm down, you should be able to see.
 There should be some way to intercept her movements.

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, ΓÇ£See youΓÇªΓÇ¥
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if IΓÇÖm not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Sure enough, I just canΓÇÖt get into training by myself.
 As for the Pervy SageΓÇª
 I wonder what heΓÇÖs doing and where?
 And what happened to him watching my training?! Damn it!
 WhatΓÇÖs she doing?
 Wow, are you painting a picture?
 Huh?!
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing like rain clouds in the sky.
 Wha--?
 The HokageΓÇÖs house!
 Hurry! Get a move on.
 Water, water, water!
 Right away!
 ΓÇô Water Style! ΓÇô Water Style!
 ΓÇô Marine Battle Formation Jutsu! ΓÇô Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
 Whoa! You idiots. Not me, up on the roof!
 WeΓÇÖre very sorry!
 Right, keep it up.
 Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 As I thought, the thing I had feared has happenedΓÇª
 Kurenai's Decision: Squad 8 Left Behind
 There she is.
 Hey! Wait up!
 Giving us trouble.
 LetΓÇÖs hurry up and take her back.
 Right.
 Hey, wait!
 WhatΓÇÖre you guys doing?!
 Anbu Black Ops?!
 Naruto Uzumaki, leave this place immediately.
 Huh?!
 As for her, whatΓÇÖd she do?
 It doesnΓÇÖt concern you.
 Listen up. DonΓÇÖt breathe a word of what you saw here.
 Knock it off! Just a minute!
 DonΓÇÖt get in our way!
 Oh! They vanishedΓÇª
 Damn it! WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 Oh, important documents are soaked.
 This will have to be dried in the sun.
 IΓÇÖll take them outside.
 Thanks.
 ΓÇÿMorning.
 Oh, Kurenai Sensei.
 Is the Fifth Hokage in?
 Yes.
 So? Is there no change to your sentiment about pulling out of Squad 8?
 No.
 Think about it carefully.
 Kiba, Shino, HinataΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre the one who recommended those guys lacking in experience
 for the Chunin Exam.
 You donΓÇÖt care about them?
 But I must not leave that problem unresolved.
 ItΓÇÖs my responsibility, soΓÇª
 That incident was no fault of yours.
 If the Anbu Black Ops are involved, then is she a considerably bad person?
 Or was she involved in some kind of significant incident?
 What did you say?!
 Calm down, Kiba.
 Kiba, Hinata?
 Hey, Shino. Say that again!
 Very well. I said itΓÇÖd be futile.
 How dare you say something like thatΓÇª!
 Cut it out!
 Naruto.
 Calm down. What the hellΓÇÖs wrong?
 We in Squad 8 were left high and dry by Kurenai Sensei.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 You see, Sensei spoke to us directly about it.
 My duty is completed.
 You will probably be provided with another Jonin in charge eventually.
 Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.
 SenseiΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs written in stone.
 Our relationship is just that of commander and subordinate.
 ItΓÇÖs just the team formation changing as circumstances demand.
 And that was that. She didnΓÇÖt even give us a reason.
 That was that? Are you guys going to accept that?
 Hell no! ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖm saying we should march into the HokageΓÇÖs office and
 protest why she is removing Kurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!
 Then this Shino saysΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm saying itΓÇÖs futile.
 ItΓÇÖs because this might be something she herself decided on.
 Pig-headed jerkΓÇª!
 Hinata, what do you think?
 I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay as our Jonin in chargeΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 But what?!
 Kurenai Sensei might have some kind of reason of her ownΓÇª
 UmmΓÇª
 So youΓÇÖre the same as Shino, huh?
 NoΓÇª Kiba!
 Just stop fighting already. IΓÇÖll do something about this.
 Naruto, youΓÇÖre not even on this team.
 WhatΓÇÖre you going to do?
 Leave it to me.
 I wonΓÇÖt let Kurenai Sensei quit, no matter what.
 I blurted out that they can leave it to me, but I donΓÇÖt know.
 Hm?
 Kurenai Sensei.
 WhatΓÇÖs she doing?
 All right, I should ask her directly.
 Umm, Sensei.
 Naruto.
 I heard from Kiba and the others.
 What?
 DonΓÇÖt give up being in charge of Squad 8.
 TheyΓÇÖre really depressed.
 ThatΓÇÖs why you went to the trouble of coming?
 Yeah. It seems they really revere you.
 I donΓÇÖt know what you heard from those kids,
 but I canΓÇÖt do that.
 I donΓÇÖt deserve to.
 Deserve?
 Please tell them all for me. Tell them IΓÇÖm never coming back.
 Sensei.
 Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, I guess IΓÇÖll try Grandma Tsunade directly.
 Naruto.
 Sakura!
 What is it?
 Kurenai Sensei says sheΓÇÖs going to quit Squad 8,
 so IΓÇÖm going to try asking Grandma Tsunade directly.
 I think thatΓÇÖd be uselessΓÇª Probably.
 ItΓÇÖll be okay.
 As for me, I know the place where she keeps her alcohol hidden,
 so if I threaten to reveal it to ShizuneΓÇª
 What I meant was that she must have some good reason for quitting.
 What? What? By any chance, do you know something, Sakura?
 Huh?
 You know something, right? Tell me.
 No, donΓÇÖt know anything.
 Come on, tell me!
 YouΓÇÖre a pest.
 Would I ever do something like eavesdrop on someoneΓÇÖs important talk?
 What? You eavesdropped?
 Yikes!
 You idiot. DonΓÇÖt talk so loud!
 Yakumo?
 Yeah. If I remember correctly, thatΓÇÖs what she said.
 I am at fault for letting Yakumo become like that.
 No, IΓÇÖd say instead that she was fine up until now
 because I put her in your custodyΓÇª
 Shizune, howΓÇÖre the nursing arrangements?
 A three-man team consisting of
 two Medical Ninja and one Anbu Black Ops member
 are keeping a 24-hour watch over her in a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.
 Even so, you canΓÇÖt rest easy?
 No.
 I want to take responsibility in my own way.
 Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morningΓÇª
 The conditions are spot-on.
 What was the girlΓÇÖs name again?
 Yakumo.
 Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura.
 Hey, Naruto. DonΓÇÖt tell anyone I said anything!
 Yeah, I know.
 If that girl is Yakumo,
 then she might know something about Kurenai Sensei.
 Lee, you are not stepping in deep enough.
 Right.
 Kurenai Yuhi.
 I make this request with full confidence
 that you are the best practitioner of Genjutsu in this village.
 Could you take charge of that girl?
 WhoΓÇÖs this girl?
 Yakumo Kurama.
 You know about the Kurama Clan, donΓÇÖt you?
 Yes.
 At one time, they were a clan excelling in Genjutsu
 and were a power in the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.
 But they havenΓÇÖt been blessed in recent years with talent,
 their force has weakened and
 they have not been able to turn out Jonin-class Shinobi.
 Yakumo Kurama is the KuramaΓÇª
 YesΓÇª SheΓÇÖs the only daughter of the Murakumo of the head family.
 She has health issues and is not enrolled in the Academy.
 Then you want me to take charge of her
 and train her to be a practitioner of Genjutsu?
 No.
 ThereΓÇÖs no doubt YakumoΓÇÖs latent Genjutsu powers are excellent.
 So much so that those in the clan
 put their dreams of rebuilding the family on her.
 Was there some kind of problem?
 This is just between us.
 Yes.
 YakumoΓÇÖs parents, Murakumo Kurama and his wife died, butΓÇª
 You okay? DonΓÇÖt push yourself too hard.
 IΓÇÖm okay. IΓÇÖm fine.
 IΓÇÖm just a bit out of breath.
 Listen to me, Yakumo.
 A Shinobi is not your only path.
 Huh?
 YouΓÇÖre a girl and you should have many other ways to live.
 I want to become a Ninja!
 I heard thereΓÇÖs a student named Rock Lee who canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu
 striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.
 I may not have much physical strength,
 but I could become a Ninja if I were to use that power, right?
 A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.
 IΓÇÖm not a teacher like Guy.
 Unfortunately, I cannot train you.
 All right, thatΓÇÖs all for today.
 Thank you very much.
 Take a bath and get a good rest.
 Right. Good-bye.
 Lee has improved again, huh?
 I heard. lt seems youΓÇÖre quitting Squad 8.
 I have no choice.
 Those who develop under me end up not developing.
 ItΓÇÖs not like that.
 Although theyΓÇÖre no match for my team,
 the growth of the Genin in your team is striking.
 If thatΓÇÖs the case, itΓÇÖs not because of my help.
 ItΓÇÖs the results of their own efforts.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 What do you think it is that we can do?
 As you say, Lee growing to that extent is due to his own efforts.
 All I did for him was to believe in him.
 We believe in our pupils even at the cost of our lives.
 We just need to believe in them with all our power,
 and embrace them with all our power.
 ItΓÇÖs not a difficult thing in the least.
 Guy, I envy youΓÇª
 I couldnΓÇÖt even do something that simple.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 Believe in yourself!
 From where and how are Kurenai Sensei
 and that girl from this morning connected?
 It would seem to be worth looking into.
 That must be the Satomi Hill mountain cottage.
 Satomi Hill Cottage
 The east trap?
 So it seems.
 An intruder?
 Yes.
 Kurenai.
 Good work on your 24-hour guard. I came to visit Yakumo.
 This late at night?
 Yakumo is resting inside.
 Could you guys step away for a bit? I want to talk to her alone.
 Yes, maΓÇÖam.
 DonΓÇÖt be long.
 IΓÇÖll be done in ten minutes.
 Fine.
 Nothing but creepy paintings.
 Please, Sensei!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 Whoa, my heart, my heart!
 Huh? ThereΓÇÖs nothing wrong.
 Hey, itΓÇÖs you again?!
 To think youΓÇÖd transform into Kurenai with a Transformation Jutsu.
 Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
 Shut up! For your sake, donΓÇÖt be nosing around needlessly.
 Hey.
 YouΓÇÖre Yakumo. Right?
 I want to ask you something about Kurenai Sensei!
 Damn it.
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Why am I sleeping in a place like this?
 ItΓÇÖs because you trespassed into the cottage
 under special security, remember?!
 Oh, right.
 Geez, reallyΓÇª
 Just be grateful you still have your life, the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.
 The Anbu Black Ops?
 ThatΓÇÖs right, I have no time for this!
 Hey Naruto, where are you going?
 Sorry Sakura, I have to ask Kurenai Sensei about Yakumo!
 Oh, hey wait! Naruto!

 This feels so good!
 WhatΓÇÖs up with those guys anyway?
 YouΓÇÖre an idiot brat as always.
 You have it hard, donΓÇÖt you?
 Having to go on a mission with that failure of a brat.
 DonΓÇÖt you, Iruka?
 Why, Mizuki?!
 IΓÇÖm asking you, please stop this kind of foolishness!
 Are you intending to betray your comrades from the village again?
 Comrades?
 That's right! Your comrades from the Leaf Village
 with whom you shared both pleasures and pain!
 You can understand that, canΓÇÖt you?
 ComradesΓÇªhuh?

 What I believe in is power!
 DonΓÇÖt think you can shackle me with such vague bonds like that of comrades!
 MizukiΓÇª
 I will soon get my hands on the ultimate power!
 Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs power!
 Orochimaru?!
 Then IΓÇÖll teach you a lesson!
 About how meaningless it isΓÇª
 that thing you and the other Leaf guys describe as camaraderie or whatever!
 MizukiΓÇª
 You were an excellent Shinobi despite having committed that crime, youΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt talk so knowingly!
 Damn! TheyΓÇÖre dodging all my attacks!
 Iruka, if you insist so much, why don't you show me?
 What degree of feeling you really have for your comradesΓÇª

 Come!
 Wait!
 Naruto! Forget about these guys! Pursue Mizuki!
 DamnΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖm gonna settle this later without fail!
 Elder Brother, that guy went off.
 They all went off, didnΓÇÖt they?
 Elder Brother, could this be a game of hide-and-go-seek?
 Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek!

 What?!

 Good job, huh, Elder Brother!
 Yeah!
 I donΓÇÖt have time to be dealing with these guys!
 Elder Brother, hide-and-go-seek is fun, but arenΓÇÖt you getting hungry?
 YouΓÇÖre really something, arenΓÇÖt you, Raijin?
 Leave some for your Elder Brother!
 Of course, I will!
 Hey, you idiot brothers!

 Yes, thatΓÇÖs right.
 Therefore, please stop the foolishness, Mizuki!
 It irks me most when you say things like that!

 Since weΓÇÖre old acquaintances I was gonna kill you quickly.
 But now IΓÇÖve decided against that.

 You always excelled over anything I did, didnΓÇÖt youΓÇª?
 I was always being helped by you, wasnΓÇÖt I?
 One year has passed already, hasnΓÇÖt it?
 ItΓÇÖs not so easy to laugh, hiding your sadness.
 Your teacher told me that you are the center of the laughter.
 IΓÇÖm not sad at all!
 ItΓÇÖs an honor for Shinobi to die during their missions!
 My dad and momΓÇª
 are heroes who protected this village from the Demon Fox!
 And I am the child of those heroes.
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖm not sad even though IΓÇÖm aloneΓÇª
 These tears are from the happiness...
 Enough already.
 IΓÇÖm always aware that you are feeling lonely.
 But you are not alone.
 All of LeafΓÇÖs Shinobi have the ΓÇ£Will of Fire.ΓÇ¥
 ΓÇ£Will of FireΓÇ¥?
 It means the will to protect the Leaf.
 As long as you have the Will of Fire,
 you and people in this village are all family.
 Iruka, I wonder if you have that.
 Yeah.
 HuhΓÇª?
 WhoΓÇÖs that over there?
 MizukiΓÇª
 What are you doing there?
 Well, I heard that Iruka was depressed these daysΓÇª
 I was worried and came to look for him.
 EverybodyΓÇÖsΓÇªworried about you, Iruka.
 EverybodyΓÇÖs waiting over there. Come on and play with us!
 ItΓÇÖs all rightΓÇª Go on.
 The Mizuki that I idolized was kindΓÇª
 And he was a guy who was more thoughtful of his friends than anyone else.
 YetΓÇª
 Please remember! Mizuki!
 You really areΓÇª
 an idiot, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 L-Let goΓÇª
 Here it goesΓÇª
 S-Stop please!
 I-I feel sickΓÇª
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Eh?
 What?
 Elder Brother, donΓÇÖt tell me that youΓÇª
 Sorry, RaijinΓÇª I squashedΓÇª
 our lunch!
 What?!
 Stay still, guys!
 Now take thisΓÇª!
 ΓÇô Give us back our lunch! ΓÇô Give us back our lunch!
 What?!
 H-HeΓÇÖs done it, huhΓÇª
 It doesnΓÇÖt look like you understand me, so let me explain.
 The real reason I was kind to youΓÇª
 Because it made me happy more than anything
 to see you in your misery!
 Hey, Iruka!
 WeΓÇÖre gonna go play soccer right now.
 Come join us, Iruka!
 Sure! Okay!
 I wonder if IrukaΓÇÖs okay
 after all those things that happened to himΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why we need to try to cheer him up!
 WhyΓÇªonly himΓÇª
 Everybody makes a fuss about him
 just because of his parents getting killed by Nine-TailΓÇª
 Serves you rightΓÇª
 Even Lord Hokage?!
 WhyΓÇªwhy is it?!
 Who is it over there?
 All rightΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm gonna try to gain the favor of Lord Hokage tooΓÇª
 What are you doing over there?
 Well, I heard that Iruka has been depressed recently soΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre lying!
 Treating a guy whoΓÇÖs weaker than oneself with disdain
 is the most pleasurable feeling of all, Iruka.
 You werenΓÇÖt that way in the past!
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖve been telling youΓÇª youΓÇÖre na├»ve!
 That kind of naivet├⌐ leads to fatal mistakes on the battleground.
 On the battleground, itΓÇÖs all about how many enemies you can kill!
 If you throw a Kunai blindly in a bamboo grove,
 all that will happen is that itΓÇÖll bounce off and its path will be errant.
 If youΓÇÖre gonna take aimΓÇª make it straight!
 DonΓÇÖt think IΓÇÖm gonna get fooled twice with the same bait!
 DamnΓÇª IΓÇÖm at a disadvantage if we fight in a place like this!
 MizukiΓÇª
 YouΓÇª
 Mizuki!
 I told you, itΓÇÖs uselessΓÇª
 If the path is going to be errant,
 then one just needs to calculate the path of the Kunai when throwing it!
 So youΓÇÖve finally gotten serious, huh?
 Follow me!
 Where is this?
 Looks like youΓÇÖre finally conscious.
 You jerkΓÇª
 You ruined our mealΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt even think weΓÇÖre gonna let you leave here alive!
 IΓÇÖm going for his stomach!
 IΓÇÖm going for his head!

 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if IΓÇÖm not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Stop!
 D-DonΓÇÖt push my father around!
 You idiot, Fuki. Get out of here!
 WhatΓÇÖre you hesitating for? Take care of him quickly.
 ThatΓÇÖs your job, right?
 Get out of my way.
 Fuki!
 YouΓÇÖve got something nice there.
 IΓÇÖll take that.
 Please spare my daughter!
 Like I care!
 FatherΓÇª
 Father! Father!
 Stop it!
 Y-You jerk.
 Here.
 ItΓÇÖs okay.
 Look out!
 Just a little moreΓÇª Just a little more, believe it.
 Rare menma pickled bamboo shoots?
 Right. But only if I can get my hands on it when itΓÇÖs in rare bamboo state.
 It seems the rare bamboo only grows on some ungodly cliffΓÇª
 Then IΓÇÖll get it, no matter what.
 And then IΓÇÖll eat some Ichiraku ramen with the rare pickled bamboo shoots on topΓÇª
 No matter what, believe it!
 Rare pickled bamboo shoots.
 I did it!
 IΓÇÖm saved.
 Huh?
 What is that?
 ItΓÇÖs a person!
 Vanished Memories
 To think thereΓÇÖd be thunder even though itΓÇÖs not rainingΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs kind of eerie.
 You shouldnΓÇÖt shout like thatΓÇª
 This is a hospital.
 You made me shout.
 Huh? That white coat.
 Could it be that youΓÇÖre helping out the Medical Team, Sakura?
 IsnΓÇÖt it lovely? I finally got the white coat.
 I see. ItΓÇÖs great that you were here just at the right time.
 IΓÇÖve got someone IΓÇÖd like you to take a look at.
 Someone you want me to take a look at?
 ItΓÇÖs him.
 Wh-What? Could that be DozaemonΓÇª?
 His nameΓÇÖs Dozaemon, huhΓÇª?
 I didnΓÇÖt think he was your acquaintance Sakura.
 No. Dozaemon is a drowned bodyΓÇª
 Oh, never mindΓÇª
 I thought I knew him, but I was mistaken.
 I see. Then I leave him to you.
 Hey, this is a Leaf hospital.
 So people outside of the village canΓÇÖt be admitted.
 Come on, just do this for me.
 IΓÇÖve got other business to attend to. So I leave the rest to you.
 Oh, hey, Naruto! Hold it!
 This is indeed the rare bamboo IΓÇÖve heard about.
 Yeah, now I can eat the rare ramen!
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?
 It takes three or four weeks to make
 the pickled bamboo shoots out of the rare bamboo.
 What?!
 First, I boil this and then ferment it slowly.
 What, I canΓÇÖt eat it right away?!
 You need a degree of determination to eat delicious things.
 Naruto, so this is where you were.
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs up with you?
 WhatΓÇÖs up, nothing, you jerkΓÇª
 Oww!
 So you force a strange patient on me
 and intend to eat ramen by yourself at your leisure?
 Ouch. That hurts.
 Back to the Past Jutsu!
 Oh, whatΓÇÖs he doing there?
 HeΓÇÖs probing into his memory from his subconscious.
 That reverse hypnosis thing, huh?
 Right.
 Have you remembered anything?
 I see.
 It seems heΓÇÖs lost his memory.
 Lost his memory?
 LetΓÇÖs call it a day. WeΓÇÖll do more tomorrow.
 It seems he doesnΓÇÖt remember anything.
 Not his name or addressΓÇª
 If none the doctorΓÇÖs Jutsu donΓÇÖt work, then this is the real deal.
 Then, doesnΓÇÖt he have something we could use to identify him?
 NopeΓÇª This is all he had.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 ItΓÇÖs a dove flute, also called an ocarina.
 Ocarina?
 ItΓÇÖs broken, though.
 Oh, it looks like this will stick.
 Not having memory could also be a temporary state of shockΓÇª
 Anyway, you sign this.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 A letter of undertaking.
 I told you earlier, but this is a Leaf hospital.
 Outsiders arenΓÇÖt allowed.
 If something were to happen,
 you will take responsibility for everything, Naruto.
 What?!
 You got a problem?
 Fine, okay.
 I sure picked up something troublesome.
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 ThatΓÇÖs in the direction of the hospital!
 Everyone, itΓÇÖll be okay. Please evacuate calmly.
 Help me!
 Forgive meΓÇª Forgive me.
 Is there anyone left?
 Anyone here?
 Sakura, did you evacuate everyone?
 IΓÇÖm checking right now.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto.
 Everything okay?
 Somehow.
 Hey, where is that guy?
 What?
 Come to think of itΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs not here.
 Please help! My baby isΓÇª My baby is still inside!
 What did you say?!
 No way. It doesnΓÇÖt look like we can get in with these flamesΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?! Hurry up and put out the fire!
 IΓÇÖll go in!
 ThatΓÇÖs reckless.
 The baby is in the deepest part of the hospital.
 What?
 ItΓÇÖs the sound of a flute.
 It's him!
 HeΓÇÖs getting closer.
 Here he comes!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ΓÇô This way! 					ΓÇô To the right.
 He did it! The baby is with him, too!
 All right!
 My boy!
 That was a close shave.
 Thank goodness!
 Thank you very muchΓÇªThank you!
 Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 An outsider with amnesia, huh?
 Good grief. What a dilemma.
 ItΓÇÖd be okay just to let that one guy stay, right?
 We canΓÇÖt do that.
 For the safety of the village,
 we must not overlook even the slightest thing.
 But, we figured out that
 heΓÇÖs not a bad guy after that incident, right?
 Unfortunately, we must not let someone whose identity we donΓÇÖt know
 stay in the village.
 Then, if he were to do something,
 IΓÇÖll take the responsibility and figure something out.
 Sakura, howΓÇÖs he doing? Has he remembered anything?
 No, nothing yet.
 I see.
 IΓÇÖm begging you. IΓÇÖll let you guys have some of
 the rare pickled bamboo shoot ramen too, Grandma.
 RareΓÇªpickled bamboo shoots?
 Yeah. I went to pick some on the way back from a mission
 and then found him--!
 ThatΓÇÖs news to me.
 So you were loitering around like that on your way back from a mission?
 Ouch. Oww.
 Naruto, so youΓÇÖre serious about looking after that boy, huh?
 Yeah, itΓÇÖs true.
 All right, then IΓÇÖll let that boy remain in the village.
 Lady Tsunade!
 I canΓÇÖt run out the person who saved a child from this village.
 Excellent, Grandma. Now youΓÇÖre talking!
 IΓÇÖm Naruto UzumakiΓÇª Nice to know you.
 I-IΓÇÖmΓÇª
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs right. Your memory hasnΓÇÖt come back yet.
 Then, hmmm.
 Menma, make it Menma.
 Menma?
 Yeah. IΓÇÖd gone to pick some and then I found you, soΓÇª
 MenmaΓÇª
 Okay, got it. My nameΓÇÖs Menma.
 ItΓÇÖs settled. Nice to meet you, Menma.
 Good to meet you, Naruto.
 Here you go.
 Wow, it looks delicious.
 The ramen here is the best in the world, believe it.
 LetΓÇÖs eat.
 Tasty.
 But this isnΓÇÖt the finished product. DonΓÇÖt you notice something lacking?
 Huh?
 Oh.
 Come to think of it, there isnΓÇÖt any menma pickled bamboo shoots on top.
 Right. Until the rare pickled bamboo shoots are ready,
 theyΓÇÖre sealed from your ramen.
 Hey, old man, youΓÇÖll be sure to make it, right?
 Absolutely.
 I canΓÇÖt wait. Say, Menma.
 LetΓÇÖs definitely come here together to have some at that time.
 Right.
 Okay, come on in.
 Excuse me for barging in.
 As of today, this is your home.
 ItΓÇÖs a dirty place, but make yourself comfortable.
 Whoa.
 It really is dirty.
 DonΓÇÖt get so hung up on the details.
 Y-YouΓÇÖre right.
 More importantly, letΓÇÖs get to sleep and
 starting tomorrow weΓÇÖll come up with a way to get your memory back.
 Right.
 I canΓÇÖt eat anymoreΓÇª
 Man, I slept well!
 Morning, Naruto.
 Menma?
 Whoa.
 EverythingΓÇÖs been cleaned up nicely!
 Did you do this?
 Yeah. I couldnΓÇÖt sleep and had time to kill.
 Thanks for thatΓÇª
 Hey, Menma! WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 What do you mean? IΓÇÖm hanging up the laundry.
 DonΓÇÖt wash someone elseΓÇÖs underwear!
 IΓÇÖll do that myself, so donΓÇÖt worry about it!
 Really?
 Now thenΓÇª How should we get your memory back?
 Oh, I know!
 Come with me, Menma.
 This is a specialty from the Land of Wind, Sand Dumplings.
 This fine soy powder is used to resemble sand and they taste really good.
 Yeah?
 And this one is a specialty from the Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes.
 The crunchy texture is irresistible.
 Uh-huh.
 And this is a specialty from the Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans.
 So? Have you remembered anything?
 NoΓÇª Nothing at all.
 Oh, I thought you might remember something
 if they had a specialty from your home.
 Sorry.
 No need to apologize.
 Naruto, forget about my memory.
 What?
 You see, we donΓÇÖt know how or when my memory will come back.
 More importantly, youΓÇÖve got your own work, right?
 Well, youΓÇÖve got a point.
 IΓÇÖve got to finish cleaning the Great Stone Faces by todayΓÇª
 Then letΓÇÖs do that.
 But before that, wait just a minute.
 Huh?
 Hey, Menma.
 MaΓÇÖamΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll carry your things to your house.
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 No problem.
 At any rate, youΓÇÖve sure got a lot of weeds growing in your yard.
 My lower back has been bothering me latelyΓÇª
 The grass grows as much as it wants.
 Then IΓÇÖll do it.
 Oh, my.
 I-I will, too!
 Thanks so much!
 PhewΓÇª Finally done!
 Naruto.
 What is it?
 They want help too!
 Huh?
 It seems this area here is all homes of the elderly.
 Thanks.
 I leave it to you.
 F-For real?
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 Actually, thank-you gifts have been sent to Naruto and that boy
 from all over the village.
 WhatΓÇÖre those two doing?
 But really, youΓÇÖre sure an odd guy.
 Am I?
 YouΓÇÖve got a strong sense of righteousness,
 I mean, youΓÇÖre the embodiment of kindness.
 ItΓÇÖs not something easily done.
 I just want to live right.
 I donΓÇÖt want to have any more regrets.
 Hm? Menma, have you remembered something?
 Huh? No, not really.
 I see.
 What?! Is it bird poop?
 ItΓÇÖs blood!
 Give me a hand, Menma!
 Right!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?!
 SomeoneΓÇªin this villageΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs get out of here!
 Menma, I leave this guy to you.
 Got it.
 Damn it!
 Damn you. Come on out!
 Damn it! WhereΓÇÖs he hiding?
 NarutoΓÇª
 Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?!
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?
 Awesome powerΓÇÖs starting to well up in my whole body.
 All right.
 Awesome!
 PowerΓÇÖs flowing over me!
 I see you.
 Damn it.
 I did it.
 ItΓÇÖs a Substitution!
 Damn it. He got away, huhΓÇª?
 You okay, Naruto?
 MenmaΓÇª
 That flute just nowΓÇª
 Who in the world are you?
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 As I thought, heΓÇÖs no ordinary man.
 He wonΓÇÖt be an easy opponent to fight.
 Wait a minute.
 You are talking about Menma like his our enemy or something.
 There is that possibility, you know.
 He could be with the intruder from the other day.
 What are you talking about?
 Weren't you two gonna help us seek Menma's memory together?
 Our mission is to find out the guy's identity
 and to catch the intruder.
 Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,

 What did you say?!
 You mean to say that only rookies went after Sasuke?!
 It really couldnΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 the situation in the Village being how it isΓÇª
 And anywayΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve taken the minimally required measures.
 Hey, hey!
 Your mission has already been assigned!
 Uh, IΓÇÖm gonna go do an errand and will be back shortlyΓÇª
 Don't worry.
 GeezΓÇª
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 ItΓÇÖs already been two days since Sasuke left the villageΓÇª
 And Naruto and the others who went in pursuit havenΓÇÖt come back either.
 And neither has LeeΓÇª
 I know. IΓÇÖve more or less heard the whole story.
 IΓÇªbelieve in Naruto!
 I believe him, but if something were to happen to Naruto and SasukeΓÇª
 Sakura, you donΓÇÖt need to worry about anything.
 Leave this to me.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 First of all, I want you guys to fan out in all directions
 in pursuit of Naruto and SasukeΓÇÖs scent.
 Naruto and Sasuke you said?
 Did something happen to the two of them?
 IΓÇÖll explain laterΓÇª Right now, time is of essence.
 Okay.
 As soon as you confirm that youΓÇÖve detected the scent,
 call me and IΓÇÖll be there immediately.
 All right! Scatter!
 Well, I guess since she saw them fight before her very eyesΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs useless to tell her not to worry.
 Stop!
 DamnΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt stopΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª Stop with revenge.
 What?!
 Even if you were successful in carrying out your revenge,
 all that will come out of it is a sense of emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?!
 DonΓÇÖt say that so knowingly!
 WellΓÇªcalm down.
 Neither you nor I could call ourselves lucky.
 Of that much I'm certain.
 But it could be worse.
 Both you and I have found precious comrades, right?
 We understand that all the more because weΓÇÖve lost them once.
 I taught you Chidori
 because you now have precious people.
 That power isnΓÇÖt something to be used against your comrades or for revenge.
 You know what that power should be used for.
 IΓÇÖm gonna win no matter what!
 DonΓÇÖt get so carried away!
 I was too na├»veΓÇª
 Watching them, they might actually be intent on killing each otherΓÇª
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª
 Please let me get there in time!
 I already said this earlier butΓÇª
 In truth, you were waiting for this too, werenΓÇÖt you?
 Neither Kakashi nor Sakura are present right now.
 So thereΓÇÖs nobody here to stop us like that time before.
 YouΓÇª!
 This time around weΓÇÖre gonna settle this for real!
 I will take you down!
 Chidori!
 You idiotΓÇª
 Same here! IΓÇÖm gonna clobber youΓÇª
 and take you back home even if I have to drag you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 It wasnΓÇÖt meaninglessΓÇª
 To me, you became my closest friend.
 Sasuke actually came out and said thatΓÇªto meΓÇª
 And thatΓÇÖs exactly the reason why I wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.
 DamnΓÇª
 Damn you!
 DamnΓÇª
 He was able to counter
 my full power of Chidori to that extentΓÇª
 That jutsuΓÇª
 DamnΓÇª
 Naruto, to what extentΓÇª!
 That loserΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª!
 Well, your limit is two blowsΓÇª thatΓÇÖs about it.
 And if I try to use more than thatΓÇª
 what will happen?
 The third blow wonΓÇÖt initiate.
 Remember that well.
 If you try to initiate the Jutsu forciblyΓÇª
 not only will the Art not initiate properly,
 but your Chakra will become zeroΓÇª
 In the worst case scenario it will cost you your life!
 DamnΓÇª I canΓÇÖt waste a blowΓÇª
 It wouldnΓÇÖt serve any purpose if we cancel each other like earlier.
 ThereΓÇÖsΓÇªno longer any mistake about this.
 YouΓÇªreally intendedΓÇª
 You really intended toΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª!
 I will use numerous speedy techniques and Jutsu to create an opening.
 And thenΓÇªI will make a hit with Chidori.
 SasukeΓÇª
 Did you know, NarutoΓÇª
 Top-class Ninja should be able to read each otherΓÇÿs hearts
 simply by an exchange of fists.
 Even without saying anythingΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre na├»ve, Naruto.
 How about it?
 Were you really able to read insideΓÇª
 this heart of mine?
 Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 SasukeΓÇª I knew that you were always alone.
 At first, I was relieved when I found out
 that there was a guy similar to myself.
 And it also made me happyΓÇª
 To tell the truth, I really wanted to approach you right away.
 ButΓÇªI wasnΓÇÖt able to approach youΓÇª
 ΓÇô AwesomeΓÇª ΓÇô YouΓÇÖre incredibleΓÇª
 You were always able to do everything.
 And moreover, you were always being praised by everyone.
 Because you and I were so differentΓÇª
 Because I didnΓÇÖt want to admit it, I decided to call you my rival.
 I didnΓÇÖt want to lose to youΓÇª
 and I felt that even more stronglyΓÇª
 because I was called a loser.
 Even when we were in the Squad Seven,
 I continued to feel the same way the whole time.
 IΓÇÖm stubbornΓÇª
 And wasnΓÇÖt able to express what I really feltΓÇª
 What I really wanted was to become like you.
 You were what I aspired toΓÇªsoΓÇª
 You are one of the ones I want to fight.
 I was really happy when you said that!
 Those were your first wordsΓÇª acknowledging meΓÇª
 You and I both knew,
 without us even having to have an exchange of fists!
 From that time onΓÇª
 Even without saying anythingΓÇª
 The fact thatΓÇª
 we are friends!
 ItΓÇÖs not without meaningΓÇª
 To me youΓÇÖreΓÇª
 my closest friend.
 HoweverΓÇªyouΓÇÖre trying to take me down for real.
 Right now, I donΓÇÖt really know
 whether you really meant what you said earlier or not.
 Thinking that we were friendsΓÇª
 That might have beenΓÇª
 That might have been just meΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs too late now!
 Naruto!
 If thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇªIΓÇÖmΓÇª
 really lame, arenΓÇÖt IΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 ButΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helped, can it?
 I donΓÇÖt know why butΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know whyΓÇª
 But IΓÇª
 IΓÇª
 don't want youΓÇª
 you to be taken away by someone like Orochimaru!
 You managed to divert it with your left hand,
 but it was meaningless.
 You won't be able to use any hand sign
 or that Jutsu earlier anymore.
 This is the end!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 that red ChakraΓÇª?
 Where does he get that kind of power from?!
 W-What the heckΓÇªis this?!
 His shoulder injury is healingΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs unbelievable!
 Sasuke! IΓÇÖm not gonna let Orochimaru take you away!
 I will stop you,
 even if I have to break every bone in your arms and legs!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt you talk stupid like that!
 I donΓÇÖt care what youΓÇÖre thinking anymore!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you go to OrochimaruΓÇÖs place no matter what!
 IΓÇÖm taking you back to the village even if I have to drag you there!

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 ΓÖ¬ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night.
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed ΓÖ¬
 Swollen as I criedΓÇª
 Hey!
 Neji! Naruto!
 What happened to those guys?
 It seems they were attacked by the Shinobi in questionΓÇª
 So he appeared again?
 He tookΓÇªhe took Sumaru away.
 What? He took Sumaru?!
 Yeah!
 Anyway, helping the guys who are down comes first!
 WeΓÇÖll split up and carry them!
 Got itΓÇª
 Roger!
 MizuraΓÇª
 Naruto!
 They were attacked by the Shinobi in the mask!
 There are no external injuriesΓÇª TheyΓÇÖre just unconscious.
 UmmΓÇª What about the others?
 Lee and Tenten are carrying them here now.
 I seeΓÇª
 Then Sumaru as wellΓÇª?
 OhΓÇª UhΓÇª
 He was taken away by the masked Shinobi.
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 He escaped into the Valley of DeathΓÇª
 We couldnΓÇÖt go after him.
 The Valley of Death?!
 Did he inhale the gas from the Valley of Death?
 NoΓÇª I put him into a state of suspended animation beforehand,
 so there was no effect on his body.
 I understand using Sumaru to lure that personΓÇª
 But to use a child from our same villageΓÇª
 Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease?
 WeΓÇÖre comrades who have already dirtied our handsΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing talking nice now?!
 WeΓÇÖll make those Hidden Leaf kids believe that
 SumaruΓÇÖs kidnapping was the work of that personΓÇª
 After weΓÇÖve taken back the star, we can leave the clean-up to themΓÇª
 Hidden Jutsu: The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
 Mizura isnΓÇÖt feeling well and is taking a break from his trainingΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?!
 Mizura!
 You okay?
 You still need to restΓÇª
 I must not rest at a time like thisΓÇª
 I understand how you feelΓÇª
 But you shouldnΓÇÖt push yourself too hard!
 IΓÇÖm fineΓÇª I can walk by myselfΓÇª
 Mizura! See, didnΓÇÖt I tell you?!
 IΓÇÖm okay by myself!
 MotherΓÇª Father!
 Mother! Father!
 Do not cryΓÇª SumaruΓÇª
 Your parents protected the star and protected the village admirably.
 SumaruΓÇª Look up at the sky and watch.
 There is a treasure you can see only in the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 If you were born as a Shinobi,
 for the sake of protecting this village, for the sake of protecting the star,
 become strong!
 Like your father and your motherΓÇª Okay?
 LordΓÇªHoshikageΓÇª
 Yeah, this looks good!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Huh?
 At this rate, Mizura will die!
 I felt a Chakra disturbance and looked into it.
 Despite him lying quietly,
 his Chakra was being activated to the utmost limit.
 If that keeps up, heΓÇÖll be killed by his own Chakra.
 That could never beΓÇª!
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistakeΓÇª
 ButΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs because of the star training.
 The star has the power to activate Chakra.
 However, many Shinobi are unable to control the amplification,
 their bodies break down and it leads to death.
 In the middle of this training, Mizura alsoΓÇª
 The Third Hoshikage terminated training utilizing the star
 due to the large amount of casualties.
 Then why again?
 Lord Akahoshi, the current leader of the village,
 decided to resume the training half a year ago.
 Something so dangerous!
 WeΓÇÖll make him stop right now!
 Those born and raised in this village do not fear the star training!
 Why would youΓÇª?
 If they can complete the training by themselves
 and make every effort possible for the village as a Hidden Star ShinobiΓÇª
 Even if the body were to be destroyed, they would be satisfied.
 ThatΓÇÖs justΓÇª
 Go!
 Notice my ChakraΓÇª Natsuhi!
 HotarubiΓÇª Please protect the star, protect SumaruΓÇª
 AkahoshiΓÇÖs ChakraΓÇª
 Please use this until you get betterΓÇª IΓÇÖm sure you will!
 Thanks, NarutoΓÇª
 But I wonΓÇÖtΓÇª
 It seems his condition has stabilizedΓÇª
 Everyone seems okay for the time being.
 It still doesnΓÇÖt sit right with meΓÇª
 Mizura and Hokuto, theyΓÇÖre all thinking earnestly of the village.
 Especially that Sumaru guy.
 He thinks of the village more than anyone.
 What do you meanΓÇª?
 If it were for the sake of protecting the village
 and the special comrades around meΓÇª
 I wouldΓÇÖve gotten impatient, wanting to get strong quickly as well.
 YeahΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 YesΓÇª
 Well, this isnΓÇÖt the time to be saying stuff like that.
 The unforgivable one is that star thief!
 But, there wouldnΓÇÖt be any suffering from training if they didnΓÇÖt use the star.
 I think so, too.
 If they have the star, everyone would train for the sake of the village.
 But if they do train, then their bodies getΓÇª
 Geez, I donΓÇÖt know what to do!
 Our mission is to protect the star. Our first priority is to get back the star.
 We shouldnΓÇÖt be meddling in the matters that follow!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 Okay.
 Got it!
 Lee and Tenten, you guys search around the village chief once more!
 What? Again?
 Why did the flying Shinobi escape to the dangerous Valley of Death?
 Even though he got the star,
 why did he go so far as to take Sumaru away?
 Come to think of itΓÇª Why is that?
 The quality of Chakra of the one who took the star
 and the one who took Sumaru away were completely different.
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 Say what?!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª There are two masked Shinobi!
 What does that mean?
 In my opinion, thereΓÇÖs more to this mission than meets the eye.
 As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku, Lady Natsuhi.
 Where is heΓÇª? WhereΓÇÖs Sumaru?!
 Before that, IΓÇÖll have you return the star to meΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll trade it for Sumaru!
 The star first!
 I refuse!
 Then IΓÇÖll take it back by force if I have to!
 WhatΓÇÖs so funny?!
 AkahoshiΓÇª YouΓÇÖre no competition to me.
 Even after you left the village,
 a few of us who were interested continued training in secret!
 You think you have completed the star training
 by training on your own?
 Verify with your own eyes whether or not IΓÇÖm no competition!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 Beast!
 Such a follyΓÇª I have no choice.
 Ninja Art: KujakuΓÇª Beast!
 Wha--?!
 To think sheΓÇÖd be this toughΓÇª
 Yotaka! Shisou!
 Go!
 ΓÇô Yes, sir! 					ΓÇô Yes, sir!
 WhatΓÇÖre you thinking, Akahoshi?!
 IΓÇÖll have you play along with me a little while longerΓÇªLady Natsuhi.
 Huh? What is it?
 A flow of massive ChakraΓÇª
 Is it him?!
 No mistake!
 Oh?! Who is it?!
 Our helper from the LeafΓÇª
 The Shinobi who seized the star has appeared!
 Lord Akahoshi is now delaying that personΓÇª
 Please fight with us!
 All right! LetΓÇÖs hurry!
 The enemyΓÇÖs power is mighty and Lord Akahoshi alone cannotΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs all he can do to delay the enemy.
 Right. Leave it to us!
 It seems nobodyΓÇÖs here.
 It seems theyΓÇÖve gone outΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a faint presence inside the residence.
 NowΓÇÖs our chance. LetΓÇÖs infiltrate!
 Right!
 Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu!
 What?! Lee?
 Since when could you use NinjutsuΓÇª?
 Tenten! ItΓÇÖs okay. ThereΓÇÖs nobody in here!
 Hey, thatΓÇÖs not Ninjutsu!
 Kind ofΓÇª
 Suspicious, eh?
 Yikes!
 UhΓÇªuh, ohΓÇª
 WellΓÇª I guess I can do it later.
 It seems to be a medical roomΓÇª
 SomebodyΓÇÖs being laid down in a bed.
 I wonder who it is?
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Sumaru!
 Why did you make Sumaru and the others do that star training?
 You shouldΓÇÖve been told by the Third Hoshikage
 about how dangerous that training is!
 You yourselfΓÇªare the answer to that!
 What?!
 That Chakra is wonderful!
 It would make for great fighting strength
 if we had one hundred, no, even ten Shinobi like you!
 The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villages would be no match for us
 even if they all ganged up on us!
 ItΓÇÖs still not too late.
 LetΓÇÖs make this village into an invincible Hidden Star Village!
 It hurtsΓÇª It hurtsΓÇª
 My body feels like it is on fire!
 Help meΓÇª
 I must trainΓÇª Star trainingΓÇª
 ΓÇô ThatΓÇÖs enoughΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs enough. ΓÇô For the sake of Hidden Star VillageΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to do such painful training!
 That sorrow must not be repeatedΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre saying youΓÇÖre going to continue this any furtherΓÇª!
 W-Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die!
 You canΓÇÖt do it! Natsuhi!
 Sumaru, who is more important than your life, is in my hands!
 There he is! HeΓÇÖs moving in on Akahoshi!
 All right! I wonΓÇÖt let him get away this time.
 Wait! HeΓÇÖs not an opponent you can take on from the front.
 IΓÇÖve got a plan.
 A planΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖll stop his Chakra, so I leave the rest to you!
 Indeed, the situation will get worse if weΓÇÖre too slow.
 Got it! Be careful, Naruto!
 All right! LetΓÇÖs go!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ΓÇô LetΓÇÖs go! 					ΓÇô LetΓÇÖs go!
 You again?!
 ItΓÇÖs more than I imagined.
 ItΓÇÖs impossible from the front, after all.
 What?!
 WhereΓÇÖs the real body?!
 Oh, no!
 I get it.
 When controlling massive Chakra,
 less attention is paid to the area around the main body in spite of everythingΓÇª
 Good thinking, Naruto!
 HeΓÇª He did itΓÇª
 A womanΓÇª?!
 The Hidden Leaf Kid has done itΓÇª
 I can find the star if I take the timeΓÇª
 But nowΓÇÖs my only chance to defeat Natsuhi!
 As long as she interferes, I wonΓÇÖt be able to carry out my ambitions!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 Beast!
 Naruto! Look out!
 Shoot!
 Naruto!
 Something the matter, MizuraΓÇª?
 NoΓÇª ItΓÇÖs nothingΓÇª

 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Oh! Everybody, I just realized something important!
 What is it all of the sudden?
 Sumaru was being captured by Akahoshi!
 Which means that the culprit who attacked everyone was Akahoshi!
 And?
 Believe it or not! One of the masked Shinobi is Akahoshi.
 Neji said that long time ago, remember?
 Excellent, Neji. You are a sharp one!
 Can we move on?

122,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Damn!
 Pretty impressiveΓÇª
 You timed it well to scatter the three to attack.
 You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
 Since it is a pretty complicated songΓÇª
 WellΓÇª
 Not only did you immediately understand
 that IΓÇÖm manipulating these guys with my flute
 but you understood how difficult this song is.
 YouΓÇÖre a pretty impressive punk.
 But you canΓÇÖt completely understand this song.
 TrueΓÇª Since art is so foreign to me.
 But since she uses that flute to manipulate,
 it means that song must contain individually specific sound patterns
 to control each and every movement of those guysΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm pretty confident when it comes to just analyzing,
 but this time itΓÇÖs not looking good.
 The reason isΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt understand musical notes whatsoever.
 Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!
 IΓÇÖll specially show you the Camellia Dance next.
 IΓÇÖll crush you!
 You shouldnΓÇÖt say things you canΓÇÖt even do.
 Shut up!
 What?!
 I told you.
 This bone is harder than steel.
 You should have a taste of it with your own body.
 Damn!
 ThereΓÇÖs no one thatΓÇÖs heard this song and lived.
 Finale, Ninth Passage, Demon Revolution!
 The melodyΓÇÖs changed!
 SomethingΓÇÖs gonna come!
 What the--?!
 What?
 This isΓÇª?
 The speed at which he flees after determining
 that these Material Ghosts are dangerousΓÇª
 Pretty impressive.
 ButΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve used my precious Paper Bombs and Smoke Bombs all at once
 and all I could do was hide.
 That white oneΓÇª
 bit off my physical energy.
 Seeing that shuriken passed through,
 that thing is semi-materialistic with very little mass.
 It's Chakra itself with an appetite.
 ItΓÇÖs probably Chakra thatΓÇÖs shaped mostly by mental energy.
 ThatΓÇÖs why it seeks stability and craves for physical energy.
 If I continue dealing with those ΓÇ£Hungry ChakraΓÇ¥
 I wonΓÇÖt be able to build up my Chakra.
 TheyΓÇÖre pretty dangerous.
 SheΓÇÖs a Shinobi who can make special Chakra like meΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu.
 Which means I should leave the white thing alone
 and aim for the main body!
 The quickest way would be to stop the sound of the flute, butΓÇª
 itΓÇÖd be impossible to get close to that woman in this situation.
 The next thing would be to capture those three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 But that's difficult too since theyΓÇÖre attacking me separately at different times.
 If I let even one escape IΓÇÖd be attacked and itΓÇÖd be the endΓÇª
 There arenΓÇÖt any openings in either offense or defense this womanΓÇª
 Heh! She might be a pretty good Shogi player.
 My remaining Ninja tools are twelve kunai knives,
 nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire, one Flash Bomb and one Paper BombΓÇª
 ManΓÇª
 I feel like IΓÇÖm playing without rooks or bishops.
 Did I lose them?
 I guess thatΓÇÖs not possibleΓÇª
 Akamaru?
 Here. Eat this, Akamaru.
 If you donΓÇÖt eat you wonΓÇÖt get your strength back.
 All right. Akamaru, letΓÇÖs go!
 ThereΓÇÖs the issue of those guys tooΓÇª
 Dance of the Camellia!
 ThereΓÇÖs no use hiding.
 Unless you can predict these guysΓÇÖ movements
 thereΓÇÖs nowhere you can run, little rat.
 IΓÇÖll find you and break you into pieces right away!
 Now then...
 All right. EverythingΓÇÖs ready. All that remains is to do it.
 ThereΓÇÖll be nine attacks.
 The outcome will be decided during the attacks.
 One!
 One!
 Wishful thinking!
 The Jutsu manipulated by this sound is invincible.
 Whatever plans you have to win against meΓÇªis useless!
 Two!
 Scampering around, you little rat! Where are you?!
 Three!
 So youΓÇÖre over there!
 Four!
 So itΓÇÖs a cheap trick. You think you can make a fool of me?!
 FiveΓÇªsixΓÇª
 sevenΓÇªeightΓÇª
 Scurrying around to get away. What is he thinking?
 Light?!
 Nine!
 Oh no!
 HeΓÇÖs lengthened the shadows with light and ΓÇª
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 Shadow Possession JutsuΓÇª a success!
 ThatΓÇÖs impossibleΓÇª
 How were you able to predict these guysΓÇÖ movements?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you could have heard the differences in my music patterns!
 I wasnΓÇÖt listening to the sounds at all.
 ThereΓÇÖs something other than the sounds
 that give away your command patterns, isnΓÇÖt there?
 Your fingers!
 It canΓÇÖt be!
 The movement of the three...
 Are you saying you memorized my finger movements and predicted?
 ThereΓÇÖs no way thatΓÇÖs possible!
 Your right index finger and ring fingerΓÇª
 The sound that you make with those
 along with the left middle finger and pinkie,
 that middle crab pincher man stands ready.
 Your right thumb and index finger,
 and your left index finger and pinkie, the club man charges.
 While you were dodging my attacks and looking for me,
 I was observing each and every one of your finger moves in detailΓÇª
 analyzing and memorizing them.
 ItΓÇÖs no useΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖre bound by Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 The most interesting rule of the Shogi play is that
 you can use pieces you obtain as your own pieces.
 From here on outΓÇª itΓÇÖs my turn to attackΓÇª
 This time IΓÇÖll hunt you down using the three pieces.
 YouΓÇÖre looking pretty composed.
 Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.
 My weapon is just this flute!
 I told you that there hasnΓÇÖt been a person
 whoΓÇÖs heard the sound of this flute and lived, idiot!
 ThatΓÇÖs some confidence!
 Retreat!
 Too bad you arenΓÇÖt able to use the pieces, hey!
 Next itΓÇÖs my turn!
 What?!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu, successful.
 I told you.
 That IΓÇÖd hunt you down using the pieces.
 I used the three pieces as bait.
 In attacking, the first hand is the trick, a fake.
 The basics are to score with the second hand.
 BastardΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helped.
 Now that itΓÇÖs come to this IΓÇÖll need to force out with power.
 I didnΓÇÖt think that IΓÇÖd get to second state in a place like thisΓÇª
 It ticks me off butΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll acknowledge it.
 This guy was a pretty impressive scum.
 What isΓÇªthis?
 ItΓÇÖs true youΓÇÖre somewhat sharp, butΓÇª
 It wonΓÇÖt go as youΓÇÖve planned from here!
 What?!
 Is she gonna force herself out of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?
 WhatΓÇÖs with that tremendous Chakra?
 The JutsuΓÇÖs gonna come loose!
 I canΓÇÖt be worrying about saving Chakra anymore.
 ThereΓÇÖs no other way but to use that Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Is he grabbing my body with the shadow?
 ItΓÇÖs just as if IΓÇÖm being grabbed by a real handΓÇª
 But, no more than this!
 Damn! What an incredible strength.
 At this distance IΓÇÖll lose to that strength!
 Take this!
 Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
 This is bad!
 Is this aΓÇªGenjutsu?
 Where are you aiming?
 I canΓÇÖt move my bodyΓÇª
 While in second stage,
 I manipulate many Genjutsu with my flute.
 Of those, this one is an appropriate for that little rat.
 The reason isΓÇª
 This Genjutsu stops the movement of the prey and ties it up!
 HowΓÇÖs that? HowΓÇÖs it feel to be the one tied up?
 So this was your last move huh? Unfortunately, itΓÇÖs a return checkmate!
 Little rat!
 WhatΓÇª?
 This guy...
 He broke his own finger with his own shadow!
 Did he release the Genjutsu with that pain?
 On top of that, he kept pretending to be bound by the Jutsu?!
 I told you this already
 that the first hand is the trick, a fake.
 The basics are to score with the second move.
 Moreover this second moveΓÇª itΓÇÖs a little different from earlier.
 With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,
 the closer in distance you are to the subject the stronger the hold.
 Damn. I carelessly got too closeΓÇª
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it.
 The most careless thing was the words you said earlier,
 ΓÇ£my weapon is just the flute.ΓÇ¥
 YouΓÇÖre looking pretty composed.
 Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.
 My weapon is just this flute!
 I told you that there hasnΓÇÖt been a person
 whoΓÇÖs heard the sound of this flute and lived, idiot!
 No wayΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 The reason I threw the kunai knife right in front of you and missedΓÇª
 was to lead you to pick it up and come closer to me, you see?
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 No way, thatΓÇÖs ridiculous!
 Am I having a dream or something?!
 But itΓÇÖs too intense to be a dream!
 That suit with its outstanding ventilation and supple fit.
 On top of that, those eyes, that hair, those eyebrows!

 DonΓÇÖt push itΓÇª
 OkayΓÇª
 OhΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs up?
 This is the placeΓÇª where Father works, right?
 YeahΓÇªThe headquarters of the Leaf Police Force.
 I was curious about it from before,
 but whyΓÇÖs the Uchiha Clan crest on the Police Force mark?
 OhΓÇª so you noticed, huh?
 Of courseΓÇª
 YeahΓÇªLet me seeΓÇª To put it simplyΓÇª
 it seems the previous generations of the Uchiha Clan
 set up and established the Police Force.
 So they used their own crest for the symbol mark of this organization.
 From olden times, the Uchiha Clan has always been
 in charge of protecting the public and the peace of this village.
 The Uchiha crest is a testament to the proud clan.
 The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.
 But even now, nearly all members belong to this first force here.
 and contribute to maintaining peace in the village.
 Only even more exceptional Shinobi can crack down on the crimes
 committed by Shinobi, soΓÇª
 Sure enough, fatherΓÇÖs awesome!

 IΓÇÖve decided to go with you, too.
 Tomorrow?

 You understand, right?
 You donΓÇÖt have to be so worried. More importantlyΓÇª
 UmmΓÇª FatherΓÇª
 TomorrowΓÇÖs myΓÇª
 TomorrowΓÇÖs mission will be a very important mission not just for you,
 but for the Uchiha Clan!
 IΓÇÖm quitting tomorrowΓÇÖs mission, after all.
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing talking insanity?!
 You should know how important a day tomorrow is!
 IΓÇÖm going to SasukeΓÇÖs Academy entrance ceremony tomorrowΓÇª
 The general rule is for relatives to attend the Academy entrance ceremony.
 There was the notice, rightΓÇª Father?

 Everyone! Congratulations on your entrance!
 From here on, please work very hard towards striving for the Shinobi path.
 And IΓÇÖd like you to bring further prosperity to the Hidden Village in the Leaf.
 GeeΓÇª I remember the time when Itachi entered.
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect from his brother.
 Thank you for your help with both boys.
 Oh, itΓÇÖs nothing like that.
 The first prodigy since the beginning of the AcademyΓÇª
 There were no students as exceptional as that boy.
 ThatΓÇÖs a bit too much praise.
 Not at allΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm hopeful for you, too.
 Become a fine Shinobi like your big brother.
 Yes.
 HeyΓÇªThatΓÇÖs Uchiha, right?
 Yeah.
 I wonderΓÇªif heΓÇÖs awesome, too.
 HmmΓÇªMust be.
 Recess at last! What a drag. IΓÇÖm still not used to this placeΓÇª
 You want some too, Shikamaru?
 I mean, all of your recesses have become meal times.
 ThatΓÇÖs my boyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve great confidence youΓÇÖll make it great in Anbu.
 This wonΓÇÖt do!
 WonΓÇÖt do!
 IΓÇÖve got a long wayΓÇªto goΓÇª
 ReallyΓÇª
 You should rest your body on your days off at least.
 You donΓÇÖt have to push it.
 I heardΓÇªthat Big Brother graduated from the Academy in just one year.
 The times are different, then and now.
 Besides, that kid is a bit special, soΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs my boyΓÇª
 Now, IΓÇÖm going to hand out the report cards for the first half.
 Taijutsu: 1st in class and academy Ninjutsu: 1st in class and academy 		lndividual rank: 1st in class and academy 		Team rank: 1st in class and academy

 FatherΓÇª I wanted you to say, ΓÇ£ThatΓÇÖs my boy,ΓÇ¥ to meΓÇª
 What did you say?
 What do you mean you canΓÇÖt participate in the assembly tomorrow?!
 You donΓÇÖt understand your own position!
 IΓÇÖm setting out on a mission tomorrow.
 WhatΓÇÖre they doing this late at night with the lights off?
 What mission?!
 I canΓÇÖt sayΓÇª ltΓÇÖs a top secret mission.
 ItachiΓÇªYou also have the role of the pipe which connects the clan
 with the keystone of the village.
 You know that, donΓÇÖt you?
 YeahΓÇª
 Keep that well in mind! And come to tomorrowΓÇÖs assembly!
 SasukeΓÇª
 Get to bed after youΓÇÖve gone to the bathroom.
 RightΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing hanging around this late at night?
 Get to bed!
 Okay.
 Report Card
 Father only thinks about you, Big BrotherΓÇª
 Am I loathsome to you?
 ItΓÇÖs okay.
 ItΓÇÖs logical for Shinobi to be ill-thought of by people, soΓÇª
 That's not how I feelΓÇª
 Brother's right. I really doΓÇªthink ill of himΓÇª
 Excellence is not easy at all.
 If you have power, you become alienated and also arrogant.
 Even if youΓÇÖre coveted and sought after at first.
 But, we only have each other for siblings.
 I will continue to exist with you as a wall you must get overΓÇª
 Even if IΓÇÖm ill-thought ofΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs what a big brother is.
 Is Itachi home?!
 I have something to talk to you about. Come out!
 WhyΓÇÖs everyone gathered here?
 There are two people who didnΓÇÖt come to yesterdayΓÇÖs assembly.
 Why didnΓÇÖt you come?!
 He didnΓÇÖt go to the assembly Father was talking about last night, after all.
 I understand that when you enter Anbu,
 you get roped into various troublesome things.
 Your father also said something like that in your defense.
 But for us, we donΓÇÖt intend to treat you special.
 Understood. I shall be careful next time.
 Now IΓÇÖm going to have to ask you to leave.
 RightΓÇª But before that, thereΓÇÖs a little more I want to ask youΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself into the Nakano River to kill himself.
 Threw himself?!
 The other person who didnΓÇÖt come to the assembly is that Shisui.
 As I recall, you adored him like a real older brother.
 I seeΓÇª I hadnΓÇÖt seen him at all recently.
 ThatΓÇÖs too bad.
 And we the Police Force have decided to launch an all-out investigation.
 Investigation?!
 This is the will Shisui wrote.
 The analysis of the handwriting has been completed.
 No mistake, he did indeed write it.
 If there are no murder leads, then whatΓÇÖs the investigation?
 ItΓÇÖd be easy for a person who can use Sharingan to copy handwriting, you seeΓÇª
 The most adept Uchiha.
 The man feared as Shisui, ΓÇ£the Instantaneous Man.ΓÇ¥
 He was a man who would take the lead no matter what the mission
 if it was for the sake of the clan.
 ItΓÇÖs tough to think that
 such a man would leave something like this and kill himself.
 You shouldnΓÇÖt judge peopleΓÇª only on looks and speculation.
 For the time being, I leave the will with you.
 Take that and you request cooperation in the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.
 UnderstoodΓÇª
 I hope we get a lead.
 Also, we have a different route to Anbu Black Ops.
 WeΓÇÖll know right away if you do something like crushing the investigation request.
 Why donΓÇÖt you just come right out and say it?
 You suspect me, right?
 Yeah. ThatΓÇÖs right, you little punkΓÇª
 Listen up, Itachi.
 Just try doing something like betraying the clan andΓÇª
 itΓÇÖll cost you!
 I told you before.
 You shouldnΓÇÖt judge peopleΓÇª only on looks and speculation.
 ItΓÇÖs because you take the liberty to judge me as patient and take me lightly.
 ClanΓÇªClanΓÇª
 You measure incorrectly the size of your own vessels
 and donΓÇÖt know the depth of mine, so you grovel thereΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve never seen him like thisΓÇª
 ShisuiΓÇªwas monitoring you recentlyΓÇª
 Half a year after entering AnbuΓÇª
 the strangeness of your behavior couldnΓÇÖt be overlooked.
 What the hell are you thinking?
 Fixated on the organization,
 fixated on the clan, fixated on the name.
 ItΓÇÖs a dreadful thing that constrains oneself and labels oneΓÇÖs own vessel.
 And itΓÇÖs a foolish thingΓÇª
 that fear and hateΓÇª what one has never seen or knownΓÇª
 Stop, Itachi!
 What the hellΓÇÖs the matter with you?!
 ItachiΓÇª YouΓÇÖve been a little strange lately.
 IΓÇÖm not strange at all.
 IΓÇÖm carrying out my own roleΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs it.
 Then why didnΓÇÖt you come last night?
 In order to elevate myself higherΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking aboutΓÇª?
 My vessel is dismayed at this foolish clan!
 From olden times, the Uchiha Clan has all along
 been in charge protecting the peace of this village.
 The Uchiha crest is a testament to the proud clan.
 ThatΓÇÖs my boyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve great confidence youΓÇÖll do great in Anbu Black Ops.
 Because you're fixated on insignificant things like clansΓÇª
 you lose sight of whatΓÇÖs truly important.
 True change cannot be made if stuck within the restrictions of regulations,
 and constrained predictions and imaginationΓÇª
 Saying such arrogant things!
 Enough! YouΓÇÖll be imprisoned if you say any more foolish nonsense.
 Excellence is not easy at all.
 If you have power, you become alienated and also arrogantΓÇª
 even if youΓÇÖre coveted and sought after at firstΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª Big BrotherΓÇª?
 What do you say?!
 I canΓÇÖt tolerate it anymoreΓÇª Captain, order imprisonment!
 Big Brother! Stop it already!
 IΓÇÖm not the one who killed Shisui.
 But I apologize for my numerous slips of the tongue.
 IΓÇÖm very sorryΓÇª
 Recently, it seems heΓÇÖs been up to his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions
 and was a little tiredΓÇª
 Captain!
 The Anbu Black Ops is a force under the direct control of Lord HokageΓÇª
 Even we the Police Force canΓÇÖt arrest him, if we donΓÇÖt have an arrest warrant.
 And as for ItachiΓÇª
 I will take the responsibility and monitor him.
 PleaseΓÇª
 UnderstoodΓÇª
 With this, youΓÇÖve woken up, right?
 We had a hindrance back at that timeΓÇª
 But it wonΓÇÖt be like that this time.
 IΓÇÖll show youΓÇª the true power of Sharingan.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 Give me all you've got, Naruto.
 Or is this all you've got?
 You were talking impudently about your Way of Ninja
 and this is all you've got?
 You've gotta be kidding! Right now, you're not even worth beating!

 WhereΓÇÖs the Third Hokage?
 The Exam arena.
 I seeΓÇª

 WhyΓÇªdidnΓÇÖt you dodge?
 Dang it!
 The Reaper Death SealΓÇª
 In this Sealing Jutsu,
 in exchange for the effectiveness of JutsuΓÇª
 oneΓÇÖs own soul is handed over to the Grim Reaper.
 ItΓÇÖs a Jutsu that costs your lifeΓÇª
 My Jutsu doesnΓÇÖt activateΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to dodge. I will die, anyway.
 At the same time the Sealing ends, my soul will also be devoured.
 ItΓÇÖs a Jutsu of the hero who once saved this village.
 From now, you will also dieΓÇª by this Jutsu!
 So this Jutsu also sealed that Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!
 And now, your soul will be dragged outΓÇª and sealed!
 My bodyΓÇªwonΓÇÖt listen to what I say!
 YouΓÇÖll probably be able to see it soon.
 Your soul is also already about halfway out, so.
 Those who have their souls sealed by this Jutsu
 will suffer inside the belly of the Grim Reaper for eternity
 and will never attain peaceΓÇª
 Those who seal and are sealed have their souls intertwined,
 and will hate each other, and continue to battle for eternity!
 WhatΓÇª?!
 This isΓÇª the Grim Reaper?!
 Knock it off! You old dotard! I wonΓÇÖt let you do as you like.
 Hurry up andΓÇªdie!
 Okay, everyone. Line up!
 Quiet, everyone!
 Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru, itΓÇÖs not going to collapse, is it?
 ItΓÇÖllΓÇªitΓÇÖll be okay.
 The structure of this face rock path is old, but is of strong construction.
 My grandpa said so before.
 So itΓÇÖll definitely be okay.
 SomeoneΓÇÖs coming!
 Which oneΓÇª?
 Uchiha, huh?
 Then, what about Temari?
 DonΓÇÖt run away like thatΓÇª
 Fine.
 IΓÇÖll be your opponent this time.
 Wait!
 Temari!
 I assumed youΓÇÖd been creamed by him.
 So youΓÇÖre okay?!
 Yeah. SomehowΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 it didnΓÇÖt turn out to be much of a delay.
 No, itΓÇÖs time necessary for GaaraΓÇÖs recovery.
 Besides, itΓÇÖll lead to his consumption of Chakra.
 This isΓÇª
 Shampoo, again?
 No, itΓÇÖs Sasuke.
 There are several smells near him. He caught upΓÇª
 At lastΓÇª
 Sasuke.
 HeΓÇÖs totally stopped moving.
 Is he going to fight with them?!
 SasukeΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs hurry!
 WhatΓÇÖs this clump of countless smells coming from another direction?
 Hey! ThereΓÇÖs something besides us tracking Sasuke!
 What?!
 An enemy? An ally?!
 I donΓÇÖt know. ButΓÇª
 But?
 ItΓÇÖs not human.
 Huh?!
 Huh?!
 Go! Kankuro! IΓÇÖll take him againΓÇª
 Temari, you take Gaara and go on ahead.
 What?
 YouΓÇÖre at your limitΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt need a hindrance.
 ButΓÇª!
 Go!
 Hurry up and go!
 OkayΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª IΓÇÖll be your opponent!
 Humph! I donΓÇÖt care who it is!
 No!
 Your opponent is me!
 YouΓÇª!
 Shino?
 Why are you here?!
 I put a female beetle on you before you left the arena.
 The females have almost no smellΓÇª
 Only a male can sniff out the subtle smell of the female.
 Though the male itself has a strong smellΓÇª
 Sasuke UchihaΓÇª You pursue Gaara.
 Because the battle between you and him hasnΓÇÖt been settled yet.
 IΓÇÖll fight him, because originally I was his opponentΓÇª
 I withdraw! Please go ahead with the match.
 Leave this to me here! Go!
 YouΓÇÖre very confident. But are you going to be okay?
 No need to worry.
 IΓÇÖll go back you up if I have just ten minutes.
 Humph. By then, IΓÇÖll be done too.
 None of you know anything at all.
 You guys probably donΓÇÖt know of the real terror of this world.
 In that caseΓÇª youΓÇÖll teach me that terror?
 NoΓÇª
 If you defeat me and chase Gaara, youΓÇÖll be forced to know.
 That is, only if you can defeat me.

17,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Is this the first time you have faced a friend's death?
 This is the way of the ShinobiΓÇª
 I won't forgive youΓÇª
 I'm going to kill you!
 White Past: Hidden Ambition
 There's murder in his eyes!
 He looks nothing like he used to!
 He's coming!
 What?
 His Chakra repelled my attack!
 ThenΓÇª
 This should do it!
 Why?!
 It can't be!
 Could... Naruto's seal have been brokenΓÇª?!
 No.
 This feelingΓÇª
 True, the seal is almost off
 and the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit is escaping, butΓÇª
 Fortunately, the seal is not completely broken!
 I still have some time!
 Do you hear me, Zabuza?
 We're both busy people.
 I know it's against your style,
 but I think it's about time we stopped playing around.
 Why don't we settle this once and for all with the next move?
 Interesting.
 What can you possibly do in this situation?
 Kakashi, go ahead. 					Show me.
 No goodΓÇª
 I can't hold his aura down!
 ZabuzaΓÇª
 I can't defeat this boy.
 ZabuzaΓÇª
 I'mΓÇª
 YouΓÇªfrom that timeΓÇª
 Why?
 Why stop?
 Even though I killed your dear friend, you can't kill me?
 Damn it!
 What happened to the force from moment ago?
 You can't defeat me with that kind of strength.
 Wasn't he someone special to you?
 Is there someone special in your life?
 I want to protect someone special to me.
 I want to make that person's dream a realityΓÇª
 That's my dream.
 Many people misunderstand.
 They pity and don't finish off the enemy they ought to finish.
 They let them survive.
 To me, that isn't compassion or anything.
 Do you know?
 How it feels to not be needed by anyone?
 To live day to day without a dream. The pain of it all.
 What are you saying?
 Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.
 You took away my reason for existence.
 Why?
 Why do you have to serve a guy like that?
 He gets the money from thugs to do bad things!
 Is that No-Brow the only person special to you?
 A long time ago, I had other people special to me.
 They wereΓÇªmy parents.
 I was born in the Land of Water, in a small village heavy with snow.
 My parents worked on a small farm.
 We were very poor,
 but my parents seem to be satisfied with it.
 I was happy thenΓÇª
 They were loving parents.
 ButΓÇª
 When I was old enough to understand things,
 something happened.
 Something?
 What happened?
 My bloodΓÇª
 Blood?
 Go on!
 Tell me what happened.
 My fatherΓÇª He killed my mother.
 Then he tried to kill me.
 Huh?!
 After the experience of the ceaseless civil war,
 people with Kekkei Genkai were hated and feared in the Land of Water.
 Kekkei Genkai?
 It's special powers or Jutsu passed on through certain clans,
 from parent to child, or from grandparent to grandchild.
 Because of their special powers,
 those of the clans were exploited in all sorts of battles.
 As a result, all Kekkei Genkai were feared
 as harbingers of disaster and death.
 After the war was over,
 they decided to hide their special powers.
 If anyone knew of their secret, only death could be expected.
 I'm sure that boy went through so much suffering as well.
 The greater your power, the more you were feared.
 My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.
 She kept it secret from my father.
 She hoped that for a whileΓÇª
 No, she must have thought that they could have a simple life forever.
 Look, Mommy! Look!
 Isn't it fantastic?
 Not you, too!
 Why? Why him, too?
 That hurts, Mommy!
 SorryΓÇª
 I'm sorry, HakuΓÇª
 I'm sorry!
 HoweverΓÇª
 Father had discovered our secret.
 When I came toΓÇª
 I had killed my own father.
 And that moment, what I thought of myself was thatΓÇª
 no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it was the most painful thing.
 The mostΓÇªpainful thingΓÇª?
 That IΓÇª
 that my existence didn't matter to anyone else in the world.
 Same with me.
 You told me that...
 You'll be the best Ninja in the village, and make everyone respect you.
 If someone comes along and accepts you for who you are,
 no one could be more important to you than that person.
 Even though he knew I was from a clan with Kekkei Genkai,
 Zabuza took me in.
 My power that everyone hated... He wanted it, needed it.
 Brats like you won't be needed by anyone and die like dogs.
 You have the same eyes as I doΓÇª
 BratΓÇª
 Do you wantΓÇª to be needed by someone?
 Are you willing to give everything for me?
 From now on, your power belongs to me.
 Come with me.
 I was so happyΓÇª
 Haku, bad news.
 I have to leave the Land of Water as of tonight.
 However, I'll be back in this land some day.
 I will rule over this land.
 To do that...
 what I need isn't consolation, encouragement or empty words.
 What I really need isΓÇª
 I already know.
 You have nothing to fear.
 I am your weapon, Zabuza.
 Keep me by you as a mere tool that heeds your every word.
 You're a good boy!
 I apologize, Zabuza.
 I wasn't good enough to be the tool you were looking for.
 Naruto!
 I want youΓÇª
 to kill me.
 Ninja Art, Summoning, Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
 Whatever you do won't work!
 You have absolutely no idea where I am now.
 HoweverΓÇª
 I know exactly where you are and what you're about.
 KakashiΓÇª
 You are completely in my hands now.
 W-What is that racket?
 What... Just what's going on out there?
 If you can't use your eyes or ears, simply use your nose.
 That's what happens
 when you're closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
 This is the Summoning Jutsu specialized for pursuit.
 I deliberately shed my own blood
 to stop your attacks both times for this.
 Your weapons have a thick scent of my blood on them now.
 Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.
 And their sense of smell is without equal.
 You're the one who was playing into my hands.
 The fog has lifted already.
 And your future isΓÇª 					death.
 I've had enough of your bluffs!
 Don't act tough!
 There's nothing you can do in this situation.
 Your death is certain.
 Zabuza.
 You were too full of yourself.
 You're too ambitious for your own good.
 You assassinated the Mizukage, but failed to pull off a coup.
 You left the service with few men under you,
 and became a Rogue Ninja.
 Soon after, your name reached our Hidden Leaf Village.
 You needed to raise funds to strike back.
 And you needed to hide from
 the Tracking Unit's pursuit and retaliation.
 Isn't that about the reason
 why you hired yourself out to scum like Gato?
 Zabuza.
 Do you really believe I've managed to survive with just Sharingan?
 Here's something I didn't copy, a Jutsu of my ownΓÇª
 To enlighten you!
 Lightning Blade!
 What theΓÇª?!
 His hand is visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Tazuna, the man you are trying to assassinate
 is the symbol of courage in this land!
 The bridge he is building is the hope of this land!
 And your ambitions will sacrifice countless lives.
 That isn't how a Shinobi is supposed to behave.
 Who cares?
 I have always fought for my own ideals.
 And that will never ever change!
 I'll say it again.
 Huh?
 Give up.
 Your future isΓÇª 					death!
 Please kill me.
 What are you hesitating for?
 NoΓÇª
 What you said is ridiculous!
 You're a weapon? Just a tool for him?
 How can you call him special to you?
 Are you really okay with that?
 Is that wrong?
 Huh?
 Tell me, what is wrong with that?
 Well, uhΓÇª
 It's notΓÇª
 Zabuza counts on me, even if I'm worthless.
 He made me feel needed.
 But now, I've lost my usefulness that affirmed my existence.
 Zabuza no longer needs me.
 That's why, I am now appealing to you.
 Please, make it quick
 W-Why did this happen?
 Is this what it means to be a strong Ninja?
 To protect someone?
 Are you okay with that?
 Are you really okay with that?
 I don't get it. I can never accept that!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied

 This is namely the secret of ΓÇ£the one that guidesΓÇªΓÇ¥
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 It probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means weΓÇÖre supposed to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, IΓÇÖm going to open it.
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs this?
 A manΓÇª?
 A personΓÇª?
 This isΓÇªa Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Sakura! Let go of the scroll!
 Oh...
 Wha--?!
 Y-YouΓÇª
 Hi!
 ItΓÇÖs been a long time.
 Surviving the Cut! The Rookie Nine Together Again!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 It appears you guys have had a rough time of it.
 What?!
 Why are you appearing with a Summoning?
 At the end of this second exam,
 we Chunin are to welcome the test-takers.
 I just happened to be given
 the important task of being the messenger for you guys.
 MessengerΓÇª?!
 Just in time.
 EveryoneΓÇª
 Congratulations on surviving the second exam.
 To celebrate your passing,
 IΓÇÖd like to treat you to some Ichiraku ramen, butΓÇª
 Ohh... Cool!
 Uh-ohΓÇª
 H-Hey, Naruto!
 ΓÇô Listen to the endΓÇª ΓÇô Cool! Cool!
 Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!
 IΓÇÖve done great job! IΓÇÖm the greatest!
 I so want to eat ramen! Believe it!
 HeΓÇÖs got so much energy.
 Yaaaay!
 Shut up!
 Man, that scatterbrained part of you is the same as always, eh.
 I see.
 Huh?
 If we had looked at the scroll in the middle of the exam,
 what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
 Sasuke, youΓÇÖre a sharp one, as usual.
 You guessed right.
 The rules of this exam were to test your conclusive mission execution ability.
 To put it simply,
 in the case of the scrolls being opened contrary to the rulesΓÇª
 In the case of them being openedΓÇª?
 I was ordered to knock unconscious the test-takers in front of me
 until the end of the exam.
 Good thing you didnΓÇÖt open the scroll.
 Kabuto, thank you!
 Phew!
 That was seriously closeΓÇª
 Oh yeah, Sensei!
 Huh?
 By the way, whatΓÇÖre the letters on that wall?
 TheyΓÇÖre kind of vermiculated and
 we donΓÇÖt understand their meaning at all.
 Never mind, never mind!
 We passed!
 NoΓÇªexplaining that is one more of my duties.
 What, really?
 IΓÇÖm saying thatΓÇÖs right.
 Give it a read.
 These are Chunin instructions Master Hokage recorded.
 Instructions?!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 Heaven in this text refers to the human head.
 Earth refers to the human body.
 No kiddingΓÇª
 If ΓÇ£HeavenΓÇ¥ does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 In other wordsΓÇª
 If your weaknesses are inside your head, NarutoΓÇª
 learn various logics in preparing for your missions.
 Hah! So meddlesome!
 If ΓÇ£EarthΓÇ¥ does not exist,
 run through the fields in search of an advantage.
 If your weaknesses are in your physical strength, Sakura,
 it means you must not slack off on your daily training.
 And if you combine both Heaven and EarthΓÇª
 Any perilous mission is the right wayΓÇª
 In other wordsΓÇª
 what can also be called a rule of might and become a safe mission.
 Then, what about the spot with the missing letter?
 The letter refers to Chunin.
 The one letter for ΓÇ£personΓÇ¥ that was in the scroll from earlier goes there.
 These five days of survival were to test
 the test-takersΓÇÖ fundamental abilities as Chunin.
 And you guys cleared it in fine style.
 Chunin is of unit-leader class.
 They have the responsibility of leading a team.
 Be more deeply aware of the necessity of physical strengthΓÇª
 and knowledge in missions!
 I want you to take on the next step,
 never forgetting these Chunin instructions.
 That is all of the messenger task I was given.
 Got it!
 Huh?
 But, as for the final third exam, donΓÇÖt push it too far.
 Especially you, Naruto.
 ΓÇô YouΓÇÖre the biggest worryΓÇª ΓÇô Iruka Sensei.
 From when I received the Leaf headband,
 I was no longer an Academy student, you know?!
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing to worry! Believe it!
 Also, this is the proof you gave me that IΓÇÖm full-fledged, right?!
 That IΓÇÖm scatterbrained may not have changed,
 but IΓÇÖm not a kid anymore!
 I'm now...
 A Ninja!
 I see.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, Naruto.
 I know their strength the best.
 If itΓÇÖs futile anyway,
 I would like to give them the final word personally.
 If youΓÇÖre that hung up on it, I can leave that team to you.
 To think youΓÇÖd play the devilΓÇÖs advocateΓÇª
 Thank you very much.
 But, theyΓÇÖre KakashiΓÇÖs, right?
 If heΓÇÖs the one who recommended them,
 I thought I could count on them.
 Stay out of it!
 TheyΓÇÖre not your students anymore. TheyΓÇÖre my subordinates now.
 The one who might truly understand
 the strength of these kids. might be you, Kakashi.
 How is it?
 Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
 No.
 Thanks to you, itΓÇÖs gotten quite a bit better.
 Anyway, Orochimaru is one of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
 HeΓÇÖs a S-rank bingo book rouge Shinobi
 who even the Anbu couldnΓÇÖt touch, right?
 I heard that heΓÇÖd already died, butΓÇª
 WhyΓÇÖd he come to this village nowΓÇª?
 ThereΓÇÖs a kid I want, you see.
 This kid inherits the abilities of the Uchiha clan, soΓÇª
 It's...
 ItΓÇÖs probably Sasuke, right?
 Huh?!

 YesΓÇª
 First off, congratulations on finishing the second exam.
 There were seventy-eight test-takers for the second exam.
 To think twenty-one have made it this far.
 I said to make it less than half, but IΓÇÖd really thought about single digits.
 IΓÇÖm hungry!
 There are still this many remaining?
 This is such a major pain.
 Sasuke and others have passed, too.
 Of courseΓÇª
 We went to that much trouble to save themΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖd all be for naught if they didnΓÇÖt pass.
 Your team didnΓÇÖt do too bad.
 I guess they were lucky.
 But as long as my team is around, they canΓÇÖt go any higher.
 After all, whether you like it or not,
 ability talks at the next barrier.
 Well, adolescence can sometimes be bittersweet and
 can sometimes be harsh, KakashiΓÇª
 Did you say something?
 Oh my God!
 Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
 But that part of you is so hip... which is what annoys me!
 So thatΓÇÖs Guy SenseiΓÇÖs eternal rival, eh?
 Guy Sensei totally loses visuallyΓÇª
 Guy Sensei is the hippest of all the teachers!
 He shines!
 Okay!
 Please watch, Guy Sensei! IΓÇÖll shine, too!
 I donΓÇÖt ever want to see tears of those dear to me again.
 SoΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt ever lose again!
 Guy Sensei.
 Sure enough, the outstanding candidates have gathered.
 Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
 IΓÇÖll get you back for my arms, Sasuke UchihaΓÇª
 At any cost.
 To think a mere seven teams are left of the twenty-sixΓÇª
 Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
 AkamaruΓÇÖs acting strangeΓÇª
 Those Sand Village guysΓÇª
 Naruto passed, too.
 Thank goodnessΓÇª
 What, all the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 Say! Say!
 Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
 It feels like everyoneΓÇÖs assembled.
 HumphΓÇªI donΓÇÖt have a very good feeling.
 To think this many are leftΓÇª
 Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookiesΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs why they fought  in recommending them.
 Now then, we will now have the explanation of the third exam
 from Master Hokage.
 Listen carefully, everybody!
 Now then, if you will, Master Hokage.
 All right.
 Before the explanation of the third exam that we will start from now,
 I have just one thing I want to tell everyone flat out.
 About the true purpose of these exams.
 True purposeΓÇª?!
 Why do allied nations conduct the exams on a conjoint basis?
 Huh?
 Raising the levels of the shinobi and friendship among allied nations.
 It wonΓÇÖt do to have the wrong idea of the true meaning of that statement.
 These exams are so to speakΓÇª
 So to speakΓÇª?
 A microcosm of battle between allied nations.
 What does that mean?
 If we look back on history,
 the allied nations of today were once neighboring nations
 that continued to vie with each other and battle for power.
 In order to avoid a futile crushing of each othersΓÇÖ military strength,
 those nations mutually selected a place to battle.
 And that was how the Chunin Exams originally began.
 W-Why do we have to do such a thing?
 WeΓÇÖre not doing this to select Chunins?!
 There is no question that these exams are to select Shinobi
 worthy of becoming Chunin.
 But on the other hand,
 these exams also provide a venue
 for Shinobi who carry their nationΓÇÖs pride on their backs to fight for their lives!
 NationΓÇÖs prideΓÇª?
 Many feudal lords and those of prominence from many nations
 who request Shinobi for work are invited to this third exam as guests.
 And, the feudal lords and Head Ninja of each Village
 of the nations will watch your battles.
 If the gap in national power becomes unbridgeable,
 the strong nations are inundated with job requests.
 The requests of nations deemed weak, on the other hand, decline.
 And therewithal,
 we can exert pressure upon each neighboring nation...
 That is to say, just how much military strength our Village is developing and has.
 Even so, why is it necessary for us to fight for our lives?!
 The nationΓÇÖs strength is the VillageΓÇÖs strength.
 The VillageΓÇÖs strength is the ShinobiΓÇÖs strength.
 And the true strength of the Shinobi is created only in a fight for oneΓÇÖs life!
 This exam is a place to see the strength of home country Shinobi,
 and a place to display this as well.
 It is because itΓÇÖs an exam where you truly fight for your life
 that this has meaning.
 ItΓÇÖs for this very reason that your forerunners fought in this exam,
 a dream worth striving for.
 Then whyΓÇª use the expression ΓÇ£friendshipΓÇ¥?!
 I said it at the start, didnΓÇÖt I?!
 That it wonΓÇÖt do for you to have the wrong idea of the meaning!
 ItΓÇÖs a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendship of the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the pride of the village and
 oneΓÇÖs own dream on the line.
 Heh, IΓÇÖm convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content of that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where IΓÇÖd like to explain the third exam.
 But actuallyΓÇª
 Master Hokage, please allow me, Hayate Gekko,
 who was given the task of judge,  to speak first.
 I leave it to youΓÇª
 Nice to meet you, everyoneΓÇª
 Umm, thereΓÇÖs somethingΓÇª I'd like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's the idea? Sudden preliminaries?
 Didn't we just get to the tower? Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
 It's too much for you, Sasuke! Please, drop out!
 You're in no condition to fight properly!
 No matter what you say,
 I'm going to tell the teachers about that bruise.
 Next episode: ""Narrowing the Field: Sudden Death Elimination!""
 Sasuke, I'm scared.

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears

 Yahoo!
 Roar and Howl! The Ultimate Tag-Team!
 Got you!
 Damn!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 I felt a response to my attack, but it didnΓÇÖt work.
 And where did his attack come from?
 Listen, Akamaru.
 WeΓÇÖre gonna attack from both sides with Fang Over Fang.
 Here we go!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 This doesnΓÇÖt look so good.
 IΓÇÖll play a melody of death for you.
 WhatΓÇÖs with this guy?
 What?!
 Two on two is perfect, right, Sakon?
 How could the Sound Ninja Four take so much time?
 Did they send such strong people after them who could hold them upΓÇª
 or are they playing around too much?
 Well, the one thatΓÇÖs probably delaying things isΓÇª
 either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot, or Kidomaru who likes to play.
 But the one thatΓÇÖs the most dangerous
 when he loses his temper is Sakon.
 HeΓÇÖs not satisfied until he kills his opponent,
 even though he should just leave things be.
 He thinks heΓÇÖs the strongest of the four, so he shows off.
 I wonder if thatΓÇÖs soΓÇª
 Tayuya has a personality thatΓÇÖs neck and neck with Sakon.
 But in any case, nothing bad will happen
 since we sent that kidΓÇª
 Kimimaro.
 HeΓÇÖll surely clean up anything that is not good for me.
 I will never let you take Sasuke!
 ThereΓÇÖs a lot of trash scattered about.
 But after all, trash is trash.
 It simply needs to be cleaned up.
 Shut up!
 Come on.
 IΓÇÖll crush you!
 So this is the so-called melody of death.
 So sheΓÇÖs manipulating them with the sound of the flute.
 Damn! SheΓÇÖs getting further and further away.
 What should I do?! What is it that I should do?!
 Huh?!
 This is really looking bad!
 Akamaru!
 Oh, so youΓÇÖre the real one!
 Multiple Fists Barrage!
 One more!
 My brother and I get along very well.
 Usually, my older brother Ukon sleeps inside of me,
 but when thereΓÇÖs a fight he comes out and helps out.
 This is this guyΓÇÖs ability.
 Ukon can stick out his arms and legs, his head,
 from anywhere in my body and attacks or defends.
 Like this you seeΓÇª
 Multiple Legs Barrage!
 ItΓÇÖs a three-legged kick. Works well, doesnΓÇÖt it?
 So next, itΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 ThereΓÇÖs no time to waste, Sakon.
 WeΓÇÖll finish this quickly! Get into the second state!
 All right, all rightΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre too impatient, bro.
 I see, youΓÇÖre saying those horns arenΓÇÖt just for display, huh?
 As soon as that right one came out,
 his Chakra increased by several tenfold.
 Shoot!
 It seemed hopeless before, but now itΓÇÖs really bad.
 WhatΓÇÖs your liking, bro?
 In pieces.
 So now, perhaps itΓÇÖs time to get serious.
 IΓÇÖll take care of you all at once.
 Such confident words! But those are my lines!
 Shoot! These guys are persistent!
 But itΓÇÖs starting to get clearer to me.
 But the problem is from here on out.
 Damn! Am I completely out of hands?
 What?! YouΓÇÖre saying weΓÇÖre gonna do that?!
 No, Akamaru!
 ItΓÇÖs too dangerous to do it here without our comrades!
 You understand, don't you?
 If we use that Jutsu,
 both you and I will use up most of our Chakra
 and wonΓÇÖt be able to move.
 If we miss, weΓÇÖll die here in vain.
 AkamaruΓÇª
 What a pitiful master I amΓÇª that you had to bite me.
 I understand, Akamaru.
 Just like you said, we only have that left!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Now, Akamaru!
 What?!
 Do it wellΓÇªAkamaru!
 Show them the results of the training!
 ItΓÇÖs Dynamic Marking!
 Playing dirty like that!
 All preparations are done!
 Inuzuka-Style! Man-Beast Transformation Combo!
 Two-Headed Wolf!
 I wondered what it was going to be and
 it turned out to be a drooling runt of a dog.
 What can a dog like this do?
 Take this!
 Drool?!
 Sakon, whatΓÇÖre you doing! To the right!
 Damn!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Heh! HowΓÇÖs that!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang revolution speed is too fast.
 ItΓÇÖs such an intense high revolution that even our visibility becomes zero.
 Even without direct contact, flesh is cutΓÇª
 A direct hit from the blow and youΓÇÖre in pieces.
 ReallyΓÇªgetting carried awayΓÇª
 This is perfect. We were just thinking of separating soon.
 What?! He divided into two people?!
 ItΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 Had we fully received the blow as one, it wouldΓÇÖve been bad, butΓÇª
 The real battle begins now.
 Damn itΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª I know Akamaru.
 One more shot of Wolf Fang Over Fang.
 The next one is our limit.
 WeΓÇÖll take them down with this!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 ItΓÇÖs no use hiding!
 I told you we donΓÇÖt chase with our eyes!
 We attack by chasing smells weΓÇÖve marked with our noses!
 ΓÇô A! 					ΓÇô Un!
 ΓÇô SummoningΓÇª 					ΓÇô SummoningΓÇª
 ΓÇô Rashomon! 					ΓÇô Rashomon!
 ThatΓÇÖs an impressive powerΓÇª
 To turn Rashomon,
 the ultimate shield to protect Lord Orochimaru into this shape.
 ButΓÇª
 ΓÇô This is the end! ΓÇô This is the end!
 Akamaru!
 AkamaruΓÇª To protect me, youΓÇª
 Damn! He did it again!
 My eyesΓÇª!
 Damn!
 DamnΓÇª! This time itΓÇÖs not ordinary piss!
 It feels like my eyes are burning with strong acid!
 WhereΓÇÖs the other one?!
 HeyΓÇª
 Who are you looking for?
 IΓÇÖll take care of the rest. Go wash your eyes in that river.
 This is my abilityΓÇª specialized in assassination, of course.
 You canΓÇÖt beat me by just having a good nose and nails.
 You canΓÇÖt beat my ability!
 You know that the Chakra Network through which Chakra flows
 is deeply interwoven with each internal organ, right?
 The Chakra Network is interwoven in a variety of complicated ways
 and is linked to the tissues that make up each organ.
 Also to each cell that makes up the tissues,
 as well as even to proteins, which are the main component of cellsΓÇª
 At the second state,
 I can dismantle or reconstruct these cells or proteins as I wish by using Chakra.
 To put it simply,
 I can turn my body into tiny pieces, enter my opponentΓÇÖs bodyΓÇª
 return to my original form and come back out.
 AkamaruΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª AkamaruΓÇª!
 WeΓÇÖve always done things togetherΓÇª
 we were together, always and everywhere.
 Yahoo! Good boy, Akamaru!
 Yahoo! WeΓÇÖre lucky that the people who got into our trap had Earth Scroll!
 With our luck like this, weΓÇÖll reach the goal first.
 Akamaru is frightened all of a sudden.
 He can smell the strength of an oppoenentΓÇÖs Chakra.
 IΓÇÖve never seen him this scaredΓÇª
 The people fighting over there must be something..
 The Seventh Round Battle. Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka.
 Hey! First of all, donΓÇÖt you bring a puppy in here!
 HeΓÇÖll get in the way of our battle!
 Idiot! Akamaru is fighting along with me!
 Now thenΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru!
 Eat this!
 There!
 NarutoΓÇª I'm taking Akamaru back.
 Wh-What?! What did you feed him? His coating has changed to red!
 ThatΓÇÖs why his name is Akamaru.
 LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru!
 Beast Mimicry Ninja Art:

 However, this one time, IΓÇÖm sunkΓÇª
 My cells can swim inside your body as I wish,
 and I can even create parts that are only you.
 In other words, a little bit of a fusion condition.
 A sharing of the flesh is what itΓÇÖll be.
 A sharing?
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇªand a cruel way of killing that only I can accomplishΓÇª
 The gradual scraping away of just your cells.
 I see.
 If thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇª!
 If I do this, whatΓÇÖs gonna happen?
 Suicide?! ThatΓÇÖs ridiculous!
 Die with meΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?

 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 The Demon in the Snow
 Gat├┤, why did you come here?
 And who are those henchmen?
 Our strategy has changed a littleΓÇª
 I'm sorry about this Zabuza,
 but you will die here.
 What?!
 Since hiring a regular Shinobi costs a lot of money,
 I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.
 And, it would have been even more ideal
 to save my money and effort if Ninja-to-Ninja battles
 ended in each killing the other off.
 Well, you are certainly not worthy of being called
 the Demon of the Hidden Mist Village.
 If you were to ask me, you're just a cute little demon!
 What are those guys?
 So many of themΓÇª
 KakashiΓÇªI apologize.
 Our fight ends here...
 As long as my reason to take down Tazuna is gone,
 there is no reason to fight you either.
 Yeah... you are right.
 That reminds me...
 I owe him something.
 He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...
 Huh, he's dead.
 You bastard!
 What do you think you're doing, hey?!
 Stop! Don't act so recklesslyΓÇª!
 You say something, too! He was your comrade, right?
 Shut up, punk. Haku is already dead.
 WhatΓÇª?
 Don't you feel anything watching him doing that!
 Weren't you with Haku for a long time!
 As Gat├┤ used meΓÇª I was simply using Haku.
 I thought I'd told youΓÇª
 We Shinobi are merely tools.
 What I wanted were his skills and not Haku himself.
 I have no regrets...
 Do you... Do you really mean that?
 Naruto, stop.
 There's no need to fight him anymore...  Besides...
 Shut up! My enemy is still... this one!
 He...
 He really liked you!
 Is there someone special in your life?
 He liked you that much!
 When a person feels he wants to protect a person special to him,
 that person can truly become strong.
 Even so, don't you feel anything at all?!
 It's difficult for me to completely become a Shinobi.
 You really... honestly...
 don't feel anything at all?
 I'd like to make that person's dream come true...
 For that, I could completely become a Shinobi.
 When a person becomes as strong as you...
 Does that person really behave like you?
 He threw his life away for you!
 I'd like to make that personΓÇÖs dream come true...
 That is my dream.
 He didn't even fulfill his own dreams and yet...
 I was happy.
 To die as a tool...!
 That's... That's... too painful...
 Kid...
 Don't say anything... anymore.
 Haku was...
 He wasn't just thinking of me.
 He was feeling pain inside for you
 while he battled you guys too...
 I know. 					He was too kind...
 I'm glad we could fight with you at the end.
 Huh?
 Yes, little punk, it's as you say, after all...
 Shinobi are human too...
 Maybe it's impossible to become an emotionless tool...
 I've lost.
 Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!
 Okay...
 What?!
 Enough! Take them down!
 Right!
 Are you crazy?
 Do you think you can win by yourself against this many of us?
 D-Demon!
 If you're so anxious to join your friend...
 you go ahead... alone!
 Unfortunately...
 I don't... intend on going... to the same place... as Haku!
 W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...
 You're going to hell with me!
 It's no big deal...
 When the Demon of the Hidden Mists Village
 dies and goes to hell, he can become a real demon.
 Look forward to it!
 I'll let you find out for sure
 if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!
 Haku...
 Now... it's goodbye, Haku...
 Thanks for everything...
 I'm sorry...
 Don't look away.
 It's the end for a man who lived fiercely.
 Yup...
 Did I... die...?
 Sasuke!
 Sakura...
 Am I... am I...?!
 Sakura, you're heavy.
 Huh?!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!
 Sakura... 					That hurts...
 Things turned out well,  didn't they, Sakura?
 Stop, you shouldn't move...!
 Anyway, where's Naruto?
 And also, what happened to that mask guy?
 Naruto's fine.
 And... the masked kid, he died...
 Died? Did Naruto get him?
 Well... I'm not really sure, but he protected Zabuza...
 I had faith in you.
 You are awesome, Sasuke!
 You avoided getting inflicted with any mortal wounds!
 From the beginning... he intended to...
 Naruto!
 Sakura...
 Sasuke's all right! He's alive!
 Huh?
 He was feeling pain inside for you while he battled you guys too...
 He was too kind...
 I see... He...
 So, Sasuke's all right too...
 That's a relief...
 Hey, hey, hey!
 You guys are too relaxed!
 Darn Ninja...! Killing our source of money!
 Now that it's come to this,
 there's no choice but to attack the whole town and
 take everything valuable!
 Shoot, this isn't good!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Don't you have a Jutsu to annihilate them all at once?
 That's impossible! I've used too much Chakra!
 Here we go!
 Enemies who come any closer to the island...
 With all the might of all the island's people...
 will not be allowed to live!
 Yeah!
 Inari!
 Heroes always arrive on the scene late!
 Inari... You guys...
 Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I can do that even with my scarce Chakra...
 At least, it will bluff...
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kakashi Version!
 So... are you ready to fight?!
 No, we're not!
 We've done it!
 Sounds like itΓÇÖs over.
 Yeah...
 Kakashi... I need to ask you a favor.
 What is it?
 His... I want to see his face...
 All right.
 Huh?
 Snow...
 Snow at this time of the year...?
 Haku... 					Are you crying?
 Thanks, Kakashi...
 You were always at my side...
 At the very least...
 I can be at your side in the end.
 If it's possible...
 I'd like to go...
 to the same place...
 as you.
 This guy...
 He was born in a village where it snowed a lot.
 I see...
 He was a boy as pure as snow...
 You'd be able to go, Zabuza.
 The two of you... together.
 But you know, Kakashi Sensei...
 Hmm?
 I wonder if the way a Ninja should be
 is really as these two were saying.
 Shinobi should not seek the reason for their own existence.
 What's important is to exist merely as tools.
 That's the same in the Land of Leaves.
 I wonder if that's what it really means
 to become a real Ninja.
 I guess... I guess...!
 I don't like that!
 Do you think so, too?
 Hmm...
 Well... That's why all Ninja live
 trying to figure that out without realizing...
 Like Zabuza... and that kid...
 Okay!
 Huh?
 I've just decided!
 I'm going to pursue my own Way of Ninja!
 I'm gonna sprint straight ahead and pursue
 a way that I absolutely won't regret!
 Thanks to you the bridge was safely completed,
 but we will miss you very much.
 Take care.
 Thank you for everything.
 Now, now!
 We'll come back for a visit again, Tazuna!
 For sure...?
 Huh?
 Inari... you're gonna miss us, aren't you?
 It's all right to cry. Go ahead and cry!
 I won't cry!
 It's all right if you cry, Naruto!
 Oh, is that so?
 See ya!
 Oh....!
 You are so stubborn.
 That boy changed Inari's mind...
 and Inari changed the minds of the village people.
 That boy created a bridge linking us to hope,
 a bridge called courage.
 So a linking bridge...
 Speaking of bridges,
 we need to name this bridge, don't we?
 That's true.
 In that case,
 I have a perfect name for this bridge.
 Yeah, what is it?
 The Naruto Great Bridge? How's that ?
 That's a good name.
 Okay! I'll get back soon and have Iruka Sensei treat me
 to ramen as the mission completion celebration!
 And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru tales of my heroic exploits!
 Then I...
 Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go on a date
 when we get back to the village?
 No, I don't think so.
 Just like that...?!
 You know! You know! I'll go with you!
 Be quiet!
 Shut up! Naruto!
 What? Are you sure that name's okay?
 This name is to wish that this bridge will never collapse...
 And someday, it'll be the name of a very famous bridge...
 A name heard around the world.
 That's truly what I hope.
 Hey, hey!

 First, check out fifth and fourth place back to back!
 FIFTH PLACE NARUTO VS. SASUKE 		~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~
 All right, here we go, here we go, here we go!
 Just what youΓÇÖd expect of me, the hero!
 To think IΓÇÖd appear right at the start.
 IΓÇÖve shrewdly got everyoneΓÇÖs hearts!
 YouΓÇÖre right!
 To be honest,
 the coolness of Sasuke in motion is unfathomable.
 Outstanding destructive power. Cha!
 Umm, Sakura?
 Our comments arenΓÇÖt meshing right off the bat.
 Just keep quiet!
 Right.
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Attack and defense with no time to breathe.
 This is gripping.
 Throw in a kick there!
 Give him a beat down and thrash up!
 Umm, Sakura. How about a little support for the hero thereΓÇª?
 Shut up, Naruto!
 Naruto Barrage!
 Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs that Jutsu?!
 You jerk!
 Chidori!
 Stop itΓÇªyou twoΓÇª
 Stop it!
 ThatΓÇÖs mean to punch me all of a sudden, Sakura!
 I couldnΓÇÖt help it. I got excited.
 FOURTH PLACE CHOJI VS. JIROBO 		~FATSO VS. FATSO~ 		Now, letΓÇÖs collect ourselves 		and check out fourth place next!
 ItΓÇÖs too late whatever you do now!
 Crushing Palm!
 Man, this battle moves me to tears, no matter how often I watch it.
 ThatΓÇÖs right! As it happens,
 I sat down on my knees in front of the TV while blowing my nose.
 It invoked tears in the living rooms in the Land of Fire for sure.
 Yeah, yeahΓÇª I really thought Choji had died in this episode.
 ThatΓÇÖs for sure.
 I was also totally fooled by the producers.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 ButΓÇª
 Boulder Blow!
 ItΓÇÖs futile!
 IΓÇÖm a hundred times stronger than before!
 They say a grudge over food is ferocious, right?
 That one punch just now
 was the grudge for you eating the last bite of the snack.
 No way! HeΓÇÖs got so much Chakra his build has changed!
 And this isΓÇª
 This is for insulting me by calling me a sacrificial piece and fat!
 But whatΓÇÖs most unforgivable is you insulting my best friend!
 ThatΓÇÖs more unforgivable than swiping the last bite of gourmet food
 or insulting me by calling me fat!
 All my ChakraΓÇª to my left hand!
 O-Oh, noΓÇª!
 This one punch is heavier than life!
 W-WaitΓÇª! 					DonΓÇÖt be hastyΓÇª!
 But seeing it again, visually itΓÇÖs just fatso versus fatso.
 No appealing parts at all and the screen is stifling.
 I mean, no way would I want to see this during the summer
 Excuse me for being stifling.
 Yikes! Choji.
 How long were you thereΓÇª?
 I heard my famous battle made it into the top five, you seeΓÇª
 Oh wait, Choji.
 ΓÇô YouΓÇÖll understand once I tell you! ΓÇô Calm down!
 Human Boulder! 97.01	01:57:15:03	01:57:16:07	I won!
 I actuallyΓÇªwon!
 We had a bit of an incident here,
 but letΓÇÖs not worry about that and move on.
 Now before we present third to first place,
 weΓÇÖll show the famous battles left out of the top five.
 Is the famous battle you chose included?
 Now then, here we go!
 EXTRA SEGMENT UNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES
 KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA ~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~
 ΓÇô Rooster! 					ΓÇô Rooster!
 ΓÇô Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu! ΓÇô Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
 Sure enough, Kakashi SenseiΓÇÖs Sharingan is super unfair!
 Just what youΓÇÖd expect from a Jonin.
 KAKASHI VS. GAI ~ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS~
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô YouΓÇÖre late!
 ΓÇô This is a famous battle?! ΓÇô YouΓÇÖre seventeen minutes
 ΓÇô Well, itΓÇÖs cool to have stuff like this ΓÇô and thirty two seconds late!
 ΓÇô included once in a while, right? ΓÇô LetΓÇÖs forget about todayΓÇª
 We both have forty eight wins!
 One of us will move ahead with this battle!
 It seems it wonΓÇÖt work even if I say noΓÇª
 This time itΓÇÖs my turn to determine the battle categoryΓÇª
 What will it be? A Taijutsu fight?
 A 100-meter dash?
 Skin diving? I wouldnΓÇÖt mind an eating contestΓÇª
 Listen, youΓÇª
 Well thenΓÇª
 Wh-What?!
 Rock-paper-scissors!
 I accept the challenge. No way will I lose!
 If I lose, IΓÇÖll do five hundred laps
 around the Leaf Village standing on my head!
 Absurdity againΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a promise!
 Here we go againΓÇª His favorite own rules.
 Okay, everyone together now.
 ΓÇô Rock-paperΓÇª 					ΓÇô Rock-paperΓÇª
 Scissors!
 After the commercial, weΓÇÖll present third to first place.
 DonΓÇÖt miss it.
 Now at last for the presentation of third to first place.
 First up is third place!
 Now then, which battle has worked its way up to the higher ranks?
 Here we go! The appearance of the famous team of Kiba and Akamaru!
 ΓÇô Heh! 					ΓÇô Damn itΓÇª
 ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs the appearance of ΓÇô Is it all overΓÇª?
 a team thatΓÇÖs just loud.
 What?! YouΓÇÖre saying to do that?!
 No, Akamaru!
 ItΓÇÖs too dangerous to do that without any comrades around!
 You understand that, donΓÇÖt you?!
 WeΓÇÖll die like dogs here if we missΓÇª
 Ow!
 AkamaruΓÇª
 To think IΓÇÖd get bitten by you. IΓÇÖm a pathetic ownerΓÇª
 Okay, AkamaruΓÇª As you say, we just have to do thatΓÇª
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Now, Akamaru!
 What?!
 Show him the fruits of our training!
 Dynamic Marking!
 ThatΓÇÖs a dirty trick!
 Now weΓÇÖre ready!
 Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast Transformation Combo!
 Two-Headed Wolf!
 Eat this!
 Sakon, whatΓÇÖre you doing! To the right!
 Uh ohΓÇª!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Though he sometimes bites his ownerΓÇÖs hand,
 he presses for a decision.
 It seems AkamaruΓÇÖs stock shot up in the Leaf after this.
 What a man!
 Man, my butt! Just a puppy whose evil eyes got worse!
 Who has evil eyes?!
 Yikes, Kiba!
 H-How long were you thereΓÇª?
 Knock it off!
 Here I was invited as a guest
 with my battle having been ranked high.
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal of finishing in third place
 on top of being told mean things?!
 ItΓÇÖs Kiba and Akamaru who finished in third.
 Please face the camera
 and say a few words to everyone in their living rooms.
 Oh, umm, thanks for your support.
 Well, we came in third this time.
 But weΓÇÖll kick the butts of some enemies,
 so please look forward to our success!
 Considering youΓÇÖre talking all big or whatever,
 didnΓÇÖt you have a rough time with it after this?
 The best is yet to come, I tell you!
 ThatΓÇÖs the last straw. Get him, Akamaru!
 Now for the presentation of second place.
 HeΓÇÖs like a completely different personΓÇª
 His Chakra activity is overwhelmingΓÇª
 And those markingsΓÇª
 The movements earlierΓÇª
 He dodged the attack from behind
 and saw me hiding in the shadowsΓÇª
 In other words, heΓÇÖs combining wide vision and x-ray vision.
 And in addition, that JutsuΓÇª
 ThenΓÇª
 Summoning Jutsu!
 IΓÇÖll find a perfectΓÇª way to attack that power of yours.
 If he defends physical attacks with rotation
 and a large emission of ChakraΓÇª
 then I should stop that Chakra rotation!
 ΓÇô This is the second place battle? ΓÇô Scatter!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! ItΓÇÖs a battle of brains while assessing the opponentΓÇÖs weak point!
 Hmm. But as for meΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not a big fan of sluggish battles!
 ΓÇô Oh, why? 					ΓÇô Hmm.
 How can I put it? lf youΓÇÖre talking about battle
 I want to see a collision of fist on fist, and body on body.
 Oh, but a Ninja isnΓÇÖt just about Taijutsu.
 Oh. ThatΓÇÖs being rude to Bushy Brow.
 Oh, sorry.
 I mean, yeah, I want to see
 something fiery, like Bushy Brow!
 There just isnΓÇÖt anything fiery in NejiΓÇÖs battles.
 Here!
 HeΓÇÖs argumentative or something.
 Unexciting or something.
 IΓÇÖd like him to just take on the enemy without regard to appearances!
 Heh! Missions with you are a chore because you think like that.
 Yikes, Neji!
 Now then, a few words from the second place Neji.
 Humph! How silly.
 YouΓÇÖre free to evaluate my battles, but itΓÇÖs unthinkable
 for me to be forced to appear in a place like this.
 Heh! YouΓÇÖre sure making an exhibition of yourself, considering!
 Oh! Could it be youΓÇÖre after an appearance fee?!
 Too bad.
 This is a program for everyone in their living rooms,
 so we asked you to do this for free!
 No problem. I asked the Fifth Hokage
 and sheΓÇÖs treating this appearance as a mission.
 Since itΓÇÖs a mission, I have no choice but to appear.
 And of course, a mission fee will be incurred.
 Whoa, always the realist.
 Neji, itΓÇÖs not fair that you get paid for this!
 My brain is built differently than yours!
 Gentle Fist!
 It seems the ranking board is busted,
 so weΓÇÖll go right on ahead and present first place.
 Which battle has finished in first?
 Chidori!
 Oh ho! Sure enough, itΓÇÖs pointless
 if the number one battle isnΓÇÖt one of my battles!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! This is the battle that
 anyone would acknowledge as number one.
 Rasengan!
 ΓÇô Rasengan! 					ΓÇô Chidori!
 And so, did you all guess right?
 The glorious best battle has been determined to be ΓÇ£SasukeΓÇÖs Battle!ΓÇ¥
 Hey, hey, Sakura. ltΓÇÖs the ΓÇ£Battle in the Final ValleyΓÇ¥!
 FIRST PLACE NARUTO VS. SASUKE 		~FINAL VALLEY~ 		What? Was it?
 Forget it.
 Well, letΓÇÖs collect ourselves and check out
 some special footage of myself, who came in a glorious first place!
 Y-YouΓÇªidiot!
 Hold it! WhatΓÇÖs up with this recording?!
 ΓÇô This is different from what I prepared! ΓÇô WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 ΓÇô No, no, donΓÇÖt watch! ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt be peeping!
 I demand a do-over as the hero!
 Someone not involved is making a ruckus.
 And now, thanks for waiting!
 Now for the appearance of a special guest.
 LetΓÇÖs go live to the site. Master Jiraiya!
 What? What?
 Master Jiraiya, can you hear me?
 YesΓÇª Loud and clear.
 What?
 Master Jiraiya, where are you right now?
 Mm, IΓÇÖm in kind of a dubious place.
 I hope youΓÇÖll excuse me from divulging my location.
 Well, if I have to say something,
 IΓÇÖd say IΓÇÖm in a certain personΓÇÖs hideout, I guess.
 Hey! Pervy Sage! WhatΓÇÖre you doing there?!
 What happened to you watching my training?!
 Now, now. TodayΓÇÖs a special program,
 so donΓÇÖt be such a stick-in-the-mud.
 More importantly, IΓÇÖve met up with someone specialΓÇª
 None other than Orochimaru.
 What?!
 SakuraΓÇª What the hell is thisΓÇª?!
 It sure has been a long time, Orochimaru!
 Oh, same hereΓÇª
 Here you could have invited me to the studio.
 Who would invite the likes of you?!
 Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsu and conducting experiments.
 And more importantly, I need him to get stronger quickly, so.
 ΓÇô If heΓÇÖs there, bring him out! ΓÇô WhatΓÇª?!
 Actually, I tried talking him into it many times saying todayΓÇÖs specialΓÇª
 But in the end, he didnΓÇÖt give me a good answer.
 ΓÇô I seeΓÇª 					ΓÇô Hey.
 What?!
 Are you going to go on and on forever?
 If youΓÇÖve got that kind of time, then continue the training, Orochimaru.
 S-SasukeΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª ls that you, Sasuke?!
 IΓÇÖll be going on ahead to the dojo. Get a move on.
 Oh, waitΓÇª!
 Oh, it seems IΓÇÖve angered Sasuke.
 I shall also be leaving now.
 Wait! Orochimaru! Put Sasuke on one more timeΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª He canΓÇÖt hear you anymore.
 I knowΓÇª
 ΓÇô SakuraΓÇª 					ΓÇô Yeah. Right!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 Now then, itΓÇÖs about time to say goodbye.

 I never thought that you were so stubborn!
 Even if you make a fuss, nothing's going to change.
 But, at this rate, she's going to abandon us.
 It's her choice. There's nothing we can do.
 Hey, Hinata! What do you think?
 We still don't know what her situation isΓÇª
 Does that mean that you're with Shino?!
 It's not like that!

194,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Milady, the skies have begun to look threatening.
 We should seek lodging for the night before we get rained on.
 I see. Carry on.
 Yes, Milady.
 What dense fog?!
 We cannot see whatΓÇÖs up ahead.
 What was that?
 Is something the matter?
 Lady Kayo!
 The Mysterious Curse of the Haunted House
 I hear that it happened while the mistress of the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo,
 was on her way to visit the household of her parents in Land of Candy.
 Attendants from Land of Candy went out to meet them,
 thinking it odd that their arrival was delayed,
 only to find that the palanquin and poles had been cast away at the mountain pass.
 I am told that Lady Kayo and all of her attendants have disappeared.
 Then, our task is to search for the Lady, right?
 That is so.
 HinataΓÇÖs Byakugan and Kiba and AkamaruΓÇÖs keen sense of smell
 should prove helpful in this search mission,
 and Naruto is, well, just Naruto.
 What are you saying, Grandma?
 That I have nothing in particular to recommend me?
 But isnΓÇÖt that the case?
 I think that you have good points, too, NarutoΓÇª
 Oh! Leave it to Hinata.
 Go ahead and list them up for Grandma Tsunade!
 Come on, what are my good points?
 ErΓÇªummΓÇª 					Let me seeΓÇª
 It shouldnΓÇÖt be that hard!
 I didnΓÇÖt mean to make it seem that wayΓÇª UmΓÇªwellΓÇª
 Hey there, you two. Are you done?
 Say, Grandma, there wouldnΓÇÖt be anything odd
 happening in this mission, would there?
 Something odd?
 That is to sayΓÇªmight there perhapsΓÇª be ghosts involved?
 Ghosts? Are you afraid of such things?
 Well, umm, erΓÇªkinda.
 There are no such things as ghosts.
 Stop talking such nonsense and get on your way.
 Which brings us to the question of where to, Fifth Hokage?
 Kubisaki Pass.
 K-Kubisaki Pass? As in the Broken Neck Pass?
 I knew I had a bad premonition.
 Fool!
 A Shinobi shouldn't dally about such things. Get to business!
 YouΓÇÖre scarier than any ghost!
 WeΓÇÖre off!
 Excuse us.
 ItΓÇÖs always like this with that oneΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade, Kubisaki Pass is where
 the capital of the Land of Necks once stood isn't it?
 The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan,
 which met its destruction 50 years ago, must still be there.
 And what of it?
 Ruined castles may be found just about anywhere.
 Have you caught NarutoΓÇÖs cowardice bug, Shizune?
 N-No, thatΓÇÖs not it.
 Oh, this is the spot.
 The Broken Neck Pass.
 It gives me the creeps somehow, I tell you.
 It's started to rain. LetΓÇÖs hurry.
 ItΓÇÖs really coming down!
 A castle.
 I hadnΓÇÖt heard anything about a castle standing here.
 Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this.
 See, see?! This mission is starting to seem creepier and creepier.
 But this may be a major clue.
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 Yeah. At this rate, weΓÇÖll get soaking wet.
 H-Hey, donΓÇÖt be in such a hurry!
 What a magnificent castle.
 WonΓÇÖt it be sort of rude to suddenly intrude upon them?
 ItΓÇÖs almost night. Maybe weΓÇÖll be causing them trouble.
 Naruto, donΓÇÖt tell me you really are scared!
 N-No way, I tell you!
 Pull yourself together, Naruto.
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 The door opened by itself!
 Excuse me, is anybody home?
 The lights are turned on.
 Please let us shelter here from the rain for a bit!
 Hey! Wait! Akamaru!
 Excuse us!
 Good evening.
 Something sure smells good.
 ItΓÇÖs still warm.
 Was someone here until just a little while ago?
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 ThatΓÇÖs one scary looking guy.
 I wonder if heΓÇÖs the master of this castle.
 If heΓÇÖs the master of this castle, than that makes him a feudal lord right?
 If this is the feudal lordΓÇÖs castle,
 then the area around here should be the capital.
 But this is right on the country borderline.
 Hey! Akamaru!
 What are you doing?
 You shouldnΓÇÖt eat that without permission.
 ΓÇô Naruto? 					ΓÇô What is it?
 DonΓÇÖt startle me like that.
 Just now, the paintingΓÇÖs eyes moved!
 You moron. How could a painting move? YouΓÇÖre too much of a scaredy-cat.
 The tableΓÇÖs set for seven people.
 So, what of it?
 The Land of Honey party that went missing also numbered seven.
 The Lady and her attendants may still be in this castleΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs split up and search for them.
 WhaΓÇª? 					We gonna split up?
 Since weΓÇÖre all here together, why donΓÇÖt we search together?
 What do you say, Kiba? Hinata?
 Naruto, stop talking like a kid. This is a mission!
 You donΓÇÖt have to scold me so much! I know that!
 Hey! Wait a minute!
 IΓÇÖm just not cut out for this kind of stuff.
 This is scarier than going to the bathroom in the middle of the night!
 This is creepy!
 No!
 Not again!
 Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru!
 IΓÇÖm too scared alone, after all!
 Do you sense it, too? IΓÇÖm sure this is the scent of a human being.
 ItΓÇÖs here.
 ThereΓÇÖs no one here.
 IΓÇÖll eat you up.
 WhoΓÇÖs that? ls someone there?
 The ceilingΓÇª
 Take that, you.
 Look at all these books!
 The History of Neck CastleΓÇª
 This was written a full fifty years ago!
 ""The enemy forces have already surrounded the castle.
 ""Our people were brutally slaughtered and
 ""thereΓÇÖre only few of the soldiers left in castle.
 ""It seems certain that I would not live to see nightfall either.
 ""But my thirst for vengeance remains in the castle,
 ""and I vow with this castle to consume every last man,
 ""every human setting foot within these wallsΓÇª
 ""Signed, Gosa Kubisaki.""
 Consume?
 IΓÇÖll eat youΓÇª
 What is this?
 Gosa Kubisaki!
 Crap!
 Hinata! Hey!
 Hinata! Pull yourself together!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Naruto, Hinata, are you all right?
 Kiba, Akamaru!
 A castle that fell fifty years ago?
 What nonsense!
 That is how the scroll is dated.
 It says that everyone who enters this castle will be eaten alive.
 True, we have been swallowed whole!
 Naruto!
 Are you okay? Hey!
 That hurt!
 There he is!
 I-IΓÇÖm sorry!
 What is this?
 This isnΓÇÖt the armor of the Kubisaki Clan.
 I wonder if this belonged to an enemy soldierΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs some more over there. They are different armors.
 Those armors bear the crest of the Kubisaki Clan.
 LetΓÇÖs hurry up and get out of here!
 ThatΓÇÖs the same armor as in the painting!
 Could it beΓÇª that this is the real Gosa Kubisaki?
 Gosa Kubisaki?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 HeΓÇÖs melting!
 What is this?
 Something smells really sour.
 There is something strange about this castle.
 Hinata!
 Yeah.
 Byakugan!
 The whole wall is covered with a flow of Chakra.
 Why?
 ItΓÇÖs moving!
 This wall seems to be alive!
 What ifΓÇª
 Gentle Fist!
 A-Are you all right, Hinata?
 Uh-huh.
 IΓÇÖve seen something very similar to this somewhere before.
 The giant toad summoned by the Pervy SageΓÇª
 from inside its stomach!
 Inside its stomach?!
 Then, I wonder if, by chance, this smell could beΓÇªgastric juices?!
 Gosa Kubisaki invoked the Summoning Jutsu
 before the fall of the castle.
 But the thing he summonedΓÇª
 was big enough to swallow the entire castle whole.
 From the time we entered the castle, we, too, have been gobbled up!
 But, why would this thing go to the trouble of transforming to a castle to eat us?
 I donΓÇÖt know.
 What was that?
 Oh!
 H-Help!
 Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey?
 SheΓÇÖs embedded in the wall.
 We are from the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 We have come to help you.
 Here, IΓÇÖll help you out now.
 ItΓÇÖs no use.
 Please hang on!
 Oh no! This thing is rounding up all the humans inside here
 and returning to its original form.
 At this rate, we're in danger too!
 Naruto, Hinata, weΓÇÖve got to get out of here!
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang over Fang!
 I am the castle.
 and by order of my master Gosa, I am to eat all who set foot within.
 Naruto!
 OuchΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll eat you.
 How can we get out of its stomach?!
 I donΓÇÖt know.
 If this creature was Summoned,
 then there should be a scroll for the contract.
 If we tear up the scroll, then this creature should return to the world it came from.
 Is that so?
 ΓÇô Hinata! 					ΓÇô Right!
 Byakugan!
 Found it.
 ItΓÇÖs up above. Probably in the castle tower.
 How are we supposed to get up there in this situation?!
 The wallΓÇÖs Chakra have begun to stabilize again.
 Who's that?
 Gosa Kubisaki!
 I wonΓÇÖt be fooled again.
 That, too, is just a phantom created by the Summoning.
 Wait!
 He looks different from the one before.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs he doing?
 He seems to want us to follow him.
 Huh? He disappeared!
 Naruto, over there.
 Oh, itΓÇÖs the scroll!
 It's starting to act up again. Hurry, Naruto!
 Right!
 This isΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the true form of the Summoned animal.
 The concentration of acid is increasing.
 Hey, letΓÇÖs hurry and wind things up!
 Wait a minute.
 What if, when this summoned animal goes back to where it came from,
 it takes us with it, too?
 WeΓÇÖll just have to take our chances. We gotta do this!
 Right.
 Did that do it?
 What the--?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Over there, Naruto.
 It should be possible to tear the wall at that spot.
 Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto!
 The lord of this castle must have died
 resenting the people who seized the castle from him.
 But, he also led us to where the scroll was hiddenΓÇª
 Then, does that mean that he decided to let go of his grudge?
 Surely that must be the case.
 WhatΓÇÖs more, he must have felt sorry for
 the Summoned animal that nobly served him for fifty years,
 and wanted to release it.
 I see.
 Then maybe he was waiting for someone
 to release the Summoned animal from its spell.
 And now, it has finally been able to return to its own world.

 WasnΓÇÖt running away your specialty?
 Shut up!
 IΓÇÖm different from you!
 No, you are the same kind of human as I am.
 A betrayer who doesnΓÇÖt trust others.
 Betraying your own brother, walking away from the village,
 and capable of thinking only of yourself. The worst kind of man.
 Such a manΓÇª doesn't deserve to live!
 Die!
 Sakura, is your wound okay?
 Uh-huh.
 A wound like this is nothing.
 ButΓÇª
 Those Rain NinjaΓÇªhuh?
 Yes.
 Hah, theyΓÇÖre nothing!
 No, itΓÇÖs not that! lf theyΓÇÖre headed towards IdateΓÇª
 Oh! Idate is in danger!
 ThatΓÇÖs what IΓÇÖve been saying!
 Hey, Naruto! This is no time to be playing around.
 No!
 TheyΓÇÖre here now.
 Naruto!
 Lucky us!
 We are invincible in water.
 Geez, what a troublesome guy.
 TheyΓÇÖve now fallen into our trap.
 Water Clone Jutsu!
 Sakura!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 How stupid. What use can Shadow Clones have in this situation?
 ThereΓÇÖs no way they can defeat our Water Clones in water.
 Even if you try to trick us,
 I'm hanging on to the real body right here.
 What are they trying to do?
 N-No way!
 What a whirlpoolΓÇª Chakra is intertwined in it!
 NarutoΓÇªyouΓÇª
 This is the application of the first step
 in my training for the Rasengan!
 Sakura!
 Sakura, hang in there!
 Sakura! Just hang in there!
 Come on! Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Pull yourself together! Sakura!
 I-I guessΓÇªIΓÇÖve gotΓÇªtoΓÇªdo itΓÇª
 S-Sasuke.ΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like it if Sasuke is the one to doΓÇª
 the CPRΓÇª
 S-SakuraΓÇª
 What the hell are you doing, idiot!
 Sasuke?
 We donΓÇÖt have any time to spare. We need to meet up with Idate.
 Wait, Sasuke.
 HeyΓÇª DonΓÇÖt leave me.
 It's about timeΓÇª
 Fukusuke reaches Modoroki Shrine.
 ThereΓÇÖs no chance for you to win now.
 You canΓÇÖt even run or stand up now.
 When that pain spreads throughout your whole body,
 youΓÇÖll reach a different finish line.
 The finish line of death.
 What are you thinking of doing with that dirty knife?
 DonΓÇÖt touch it!
 Looks like you still donΓÇÖt understand your situation.
 All you have to do is run away.
 You have no right to even the slightest bit of integrity.
 BossΓÇª
 I'm sorryΓÇª
 BossΓÇª
 I couldn't keepΓÇª
 the promise I made with you.
 Idate!
 You bastard!
 Darn, what a downpour.
 Are you the boss of the Rain Ninja?!
 Looks like it was too hard a task for them.
 Even if they were the same Genin as you,
 seems like the Hidden Leaf ones are better.
 This is terribleΓÇª
 But can Genin-level Ninja fight against me?
 Shut up!
 Above!
 HumphΓÇª So that's your level, after all.
 I'll use the same method I used on Idate,
 and send you to hell.
 No need to waste my Chakra.
 Sakura!
 Th-These darned thingsΓÇª
 Those are poisoned needles specially made by the Hidden Rain Village.
 They will send you to hell in a few minutes,
 no matter how strong you are.
 DonΓÇÖt you look down on us! Bastard--!
 Looks like Fukusuke has reached Modoroki Shrine.
 Die gasping.
 ItΓÇÖs a death that fits you Genin brats well.
 Is Wagarashi winning this one too?
 IsnΓÇÖt there a God or Buddha in this world?
 I miss the old times when Jirocho was in charge.
 Terrible, terrible, IΓÇÖm drenched.
 You are amazing, Fukusuke.
 Keep on running to the goal, and make our Boss Wagarashi happy.
 Watch it, you scum.
 Who do you think you are talking to?
 What?
 My victory is already assured. Let me relax for a while.
 Bastard, think you're so hot?!
 Cut it outΓÇª
 BrotherΓÇª
 What if something goes wrong during the race?
 Who knows what our boss will do to us.
 All right.
 Just wait and see.
 Darn, that bastard!
 Naruto, SasukeΓÇª
 Take this.
 SakuraΓÇª What's that?
 Before leaving the Leaf Village,
 Lady Tsunade handed this to me.
 Take this with you. I am sure it will come in handy.
 Old Lady Tsunade?
 I think heΓÇÖll recover consciousness now.
 Sasuke and Naruto, you take this, too.
 O-Okay.
 Also, weΓÇÖll be too cold here, so we need to move somewhere else.
 Brother!
 Look! IΓÇÖve finally become a Ninja, too!
 I seeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve got to become the best in everything!
 IΓÇÖll train hard, and complete lots of missions.
 And IΓÇÖll become a Chunin super fast.
 Then after that, a Jonin.
 IΓÇÖm going to be like you, Brother!
 IΓÇÖm Idate, the Swift Runner making headway in life.
 Brother?
 Listen IdateΓÇª
 In the world of Shinobi,
 there is something more important than success or power.
 Something more important?
 Until you understand that, itΓÇÖs too early for you to talk that way.
 Oh!
 HeΓÇÖs conscious now.
 Are you okay?
 What happened to Aoi?!
 He disappearedΓÇª
 So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi?
 Idate, do you know him?
 HeΓÇª
 was a teacher when I was in the Leaf Village.
 YouΓÇªare from the Leaf Village?
 AoiΓÇªbetrayed the Leaf Village
 and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain.
 What the hell do you mean?
 Not yet.
 You have to rest a little more.
 How is your hand there?
 That handΓÇª
 You kept it clenched all this time.
 Darn! IΓÇÖd come all this way, and yet IΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs too early to give up!
 And you tell us that you were once a Shinobi of the Leaf?!
 I forgot all about the LeafΓÇª
 the moment I walked away from the village.
 You walked away from the village?
 I was depressed after failing the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 That was close, IdateΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt take it so hard.
 There are ways to become a Chunin other than the Chunin Exam.
 Really?!
 Yes, really.
 Just do as I tell you.
 Okay!
 Aoi SenseiΓÇª
 IdateΓÇª
 Aoi Sensei, IΓÇÖd brought them as you told me to.
 All right.
 These are indeed the Scroll of Sealing and the legendary blade,
 the Blade of the Thunder God, believed to have been used by the Second Hokage.
 Well done, Idate.
 Now I can become a Chunin, right?
 Sure you canΓÇª
 in the Village Hidden in the Rain.
 You are leaving the Leaf together with me,
 taking these as gifts to them.
 ButΓÇª
 Of course.
 There's no way you can get away with stealing the villageΓÇÖs treasures.
 You tricked me!
 To survive in this world, you must not believe in othersΓÇª
 Remember that.
 Well, what are you going to do, Idate?
 Either way, you are already a Rogue Ninja.
 YouΓÇÖll be chained in jail for life, if you are lucky.
 YouΓÇÖll be chained in jail for life, if you are lucky.
 Ever since then, I havenΓÇÖt returned to the village.
 I am an irresponsible man who canΓÇÖt do a single thing right.
 But Boss Jirocho believed in me.
 Even though I'd never been of any use to him.
 Boss Jirocho had faith in me!
 And yet, IΓÇª!
 HeΓÇÖsΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖsΓÇªlike the old meΓÇª
 No one will ever accept you! Die Naruto!
 Duck down, Naruto!
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªa worthless guyΓÇª
 W-Why?
 Because we are the same.
 HeΓÇÖs like me of the old days.
 I go around and around, and get nowhereΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt do anything right.
 Aoi is right.
 I haveΓÇªno right to live--
 You idiot!
 ThereΓÇÖs a person who still trusts you, right?
 I know, Naruto.
 You felt aloneΓÇª and you were suffering!
 One is enough!
 The race isnΓÇÖt over yet!
 You never know how things will turn out unless you try until the very end.
 ButΓÇª
 Stand up now!
 Naruto, itΓÇÖs not possible! ldateΓÇÖs body is stillΓÇª
 If he canΓÇÖt run, then IΓÇÖll carry him on my back and run!
 The opponent must already be in Modoroki ShrineΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt give up!
 HeyΓÇª NarutoΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs leave it to Naruto here.
 Jirocho is waiting for you, right?
 Pull yourself together!
 Boss, donΓÇÖt you think he actually ran away?
 HeΓÇÖll come.
 I believe in Idate!
 If you run away now, youΓÇÖll be a loser for your entire life!
 For the people who believe in you and wait for youΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the fastest boat around here.
 I'm grateful.
 No problem.
 Edged tools arenΓÇÖt for hurting peopleΓÇª
 Show them what youΓÇÖve got!
 Naruto! Please take me there!
 All right. Leave it to me!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Hey you!
 What're you jabbering about, lecturing like you're something else?!
 You are so annoying!
 Come on, Idate.
 Boss Jirochi is waiting for you at the finish line, right?
 I don't care if this guy is a Jonin or whatever.
 I'm gonna beat him and make for the finish line with all my might!

 That darn NarutoΓÇª
 Zero Motivation: The Guy with Cloud Envy!
 ΓÇô CΓÇÖmon! ΓÇô Hurry up with the match!
 Finish it up already!
 Stand up and start the match!
 Evidently, people donΓÇÖt want to see the minor playersΓÇÖ matches
 since they were really looking forward to SasukeΓÇÖs matchΓÇª
 If people aren't expecting anything exciting from this battle,
 makes no sense for me to have it.
 What? YouΓÇÖre giving up, too?
 My opponentΓÇÖs a girl again?
 Hey, why arenΓÇÖt you moving?!
 C'mon, get started!
 That kid has had zero fighting spirit from the beginningΓÇª
 CΓÇÖmon! What is he doing?!
 CΓÇÖmon Shikamaru! Get it together and do it!
 If you donΓÇÖt come, IΓÇÖll go!
 Hey! HavenΓÇÖt started yetΓÇª
 Man, that girl is so gung-ho.
 It doesnΓÇÖt really matter if I become a Chunin or not.
 But there's no reason why a man should lose to a woman.
 WellΓÇª letΓÇÖs do it!
 This guyΓÇÖs quick to run awayΓÇª
 Nor any reason why a man should rough up a woman.
 But I donΓÇÖt want to be roughed up either.
 HeΓÇÖs the kind of Ninja that uses shadows.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 HeΓÇÖs probably trying to lure me into the trees where there're lots of shadowsΓÇª
 but I wonΓÇÖt let him.
 Why am I the only one who always gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!
 Shikamaru! You get her with a torrent of 16 combinationΓÇª!
 Mind if I sit here?
 Huh?
 WhatΓÇªyou? Your stomach okay?
 What? WasnΓÇÖt SasukeΓÇÖs match next?
 Shh!
 EverythingΓÇÖs fine, right, Sakura? After all, it's Sasuke, right?
 R-Right now, I should leave her alone.
 It looks like Shikamaru taking part in this final battle,
 it seems like he's in the wrong place.
 DonΓÇÖt say that!
 I certainly donΓÇÖt think that he has any great techniques,
 but that Shikamaru is always good at strategizing.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I feel like we ended up in the preliminary round the other day.
 Hmm, yeah wellΓÇª
 And after all, he jumped down into the arena himself.
 He seems uncharacteristically driven.
 Even he can be passionate once in a while!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Geez, I envy a cloud being so freeΓÇª
 I guess I pretty much am completely without desireΓÇª
 Even the reason why I became a NinjaΓÇª
 was because I thought I would have a fun life, ya knowΓÇª
 Get it together!
 CΓÇÖmon Shikamaru!
 ButΓÇªof course, itΓÇÖs not that easy.
 WhatΓÇÖs going on with that stupid face?! ls he underestimating me?
 Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 ThatΓÇÖs right, with this attack, my armed attacks also were beaten down.
 I seeΓÇª
 Shadow Possession Jutsu! IΓÇÖve seen that true identity!
 Evidently thereΓÇÖs a limit to the stretching and shortening,
 changing shape of the shadowΓÇª
 No matter how much you change the shape of the shadow,
 even when you stretch it,
 it can only span up to the size of your own shadow.
 ThatΓÇÖs right isnΓÇÖt it?
 You got itΓÇª
 Even if I assume that he's made up the distance,
 by stretching his shadow from the edge of the shadow of the arena wallΓÇª
 This is the limit to how far the shadow can stretch.
 This is the scope of his attack!
 15 meters, 32 centimeters!
 She took the distance with the folding fan.
 Temari is stronger at long distance battles than she is at close rangeΓÇª
 the outcome has already been decided.
 What? What is that signΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs no sign. ThatΓÇÖs like, his habit.
 HabitΓÇª?
 He enjoys passing time slowly. That guyΓÇÖs like an old man.
 ThatΓÇÖs why he likes Japanese checkers and chess
 and always makes me be his opponent.
 When heΓÇÖs stuck on a move, he always does that.
 Why?
 HeΓÇÖs working out his strategy.
 And, IΓÇÖve never beaten him.
 A strategyΓÇª but this is an actual fight.
 ItΓÇÖs different from a game.
 But it's said that formation pieces that were used to build battle strategy
 eventually become game pieces.
 Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.
 Wait a minute.
 When we grouped the Genin, I saw his scores.
 They were at about the same level of that NarutoΓÇÖs.
 He said that moving his pencil during written exams at the academy is a pain,
 and during the tests, he always sleeps instead.
 A painΓÇª?
 He was so good at strategy games, I felt something wasnΓÇÖt rightΓÇª
 so I had him take an IQ test under the pretense that it was a game.
 AndΓÇª how did it turn out?... ΓÇª
 He was more than brilliant.
 With an IQ of over 200, heΓÇÖs a super genius!
 T-Two hundred?!
 HeΓÇÖs done thinkingΓÇª lt starts now.
 Looks like youΓÇÖve got some fighting spirit nowΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs pointless to hide!
 I wonder if heΓÇÖs really got a strategyΓÇª
 M-MaybeΓÇª
 With that he has no approach!
 Shikamaru! Go for it!
 ItΓÇÖs pointless, isnΓÇÖt it?
 HeΓÇÖll give up soon.
 He hates things that are a pain in the butt.
 You're wrong! At least, I hope soΓÇª
 But you may be rightΓÇª
 How long are you going to run away! Cut it out!
 ItΓÇÖs no use.
 As long as IΓÇÖm on the outside of this line,
 he absolutely canΓÇÖt catch meΓÇª
 No, wait! Close call!
 You caught on well.
 So you were dragging your feet to wait for the sun to setΓÇª
 in order to make the surface of your own shadow larger
 by stretching the shadow line of the wall.
 As the sun goes down, the shadows lengthen.
 Isn't that so?
 That was close! ShikamaruΓÇª
 But why is he using shadows?
 After all, Shikamaru is inside the shadow of the field.
 If thereΓÇÖs even a little bit of light, he can make a shadow within a shadow!
 You donΓÇÖt know a thing about Shikamaru!
 A shadowΓÇªin a shadowΓÇª?
 Even if I calculate the height of the sun now
 and the limit to the distance of the previous attack,
 there's no mistaking the distance!
 Temari! Up!
 I see.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Darn it!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you escape!
 I didnΓÇÖt expect that he would create extra shadows to reach me
 by making a parachute with his jacketΓÇª!
 HeΓÇÖs impressive.
 Once I notice the parachute from above, IΓÇÖll take my attention off from my feet.
 ThatΓÇÖs a sneaky trick to catch me off my guard!
 However, now itΓÇÖs clear.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is
 one in which other shadows are used to get your opponent,
 a skillful technique!
 SheΓÇÖs dodged this trick tooΓÇª
 Not careful enough in the final stage.
 And his opponent is fairly analytical.
 SheΓÇÖs good at thinking ahead.
 If this battle takes too long,
 the shadows in the arena will grow, and his territory will increase.
 IΓÇÖll defeat him with the next one!
 Should I make a diversion with Clone JutsuΓÇª?
 Now his shadow isΓÇª
 Okay!
 CloneΓÇª
 N-No wayΓÇª!
 My... body isΓÇª?!
 At lastΓÇª Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
 What?!
 WhatΓÇÖs going onΓÇª?
 That boyΓÇª
 How much is he planning aheadΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs ShikamaruΓÇÖs skill.
 WhyΓÇªwonΓÇÖt my body move?!
 The shadow shouldnΓÇÖt have reached this far.
 I'll let you take a look behind youΓÇª
 T-This holeΓÇª!
 You saw it too, didnΓÇÖt youΓÇª?
 That hole is the hole Naruto burrowed and flew out of.
 So itΓÇÖs connected to the big hole in front of you.
 I didnΓÇÖt expect thatΓÇª a shadow in a tunnel of a holeΓÇª
 Right.
 Pure and simple, a calculated chess move.
 So his purpose to make Temari measure the limit of the shadow several times
 was to lead her to his final trick of using this hole.
 Temari battled on the outside of the limit of the shadow
 that she measured and followed,
 but he caught her from behind, trailed by the shadow she couldnΓÇÖt seeΓÇª
 There is no escape from this.
 I-It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 The attack that he used with the jacket,
 was it a device to lead me to right this spotΓÇª?
 Was that an underplot too?!
 Why that--?!
 Checkmate with the next one.
 My body is moving on its own! I canΓÇÖt resist it!
 Before anyone knew it, they fell under the spell of this match.
 That guy with no mark is quite a darkhorse.
 Yes! You did it!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 CheckΓÇª
 Good griefΓÇª I give up!
 What?!
 See I told youΓÇªheΓÇÖd give up.
 Ino doesnΓÇÖt know anything about Shikamaru.
 W-What did you say?!
 IΓÇÖve used too much Chakra from Shadow Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.
 I canΓÇÖt hold it another 10 seconds.
 I thought of the next trick 200 times.
 But IΓÇÖm out of timeΓÇª
 This has become such a pain.
 Doing one match is goodΓÇª
 That guy is a strange one.
 The winner is Temari!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says ΓÇ£I LOVE YOUΓÇ¥
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the skyΓÇÖs smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Wow, this is the largest cheer from the audience ever!
 Of course. The featured battle of this final tournament is about to begin.
 Hate to admit it, but I'm looking forward to it myself.
 Hey, Shikamaru. I can't hear what you said.
 There's not a single person who's not excited about the featured battle.
 Next: ""Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand""

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal

 Being able toΓÇª drink sake tranquilly like thisΓÇª
 Please, this isnΓÇÖt the time to be drinking sake!
 Especially at a time when the village is enjoying peaceΓÇª
 you should hurry up and finish up your work!
 Why is it that work never seems to cease?
 ThatΓÇÖs because you never bring a single thing to completion, Lady Tsunade!
 ThereΓÇÖs disquiet among the Kamizuru Clan?
 ThatΓÇÖs a communiqu├⌐ from the ANBU Unit
 stationed in the Land of the Earth, isnΓÇÖt it?
 ThatΓÇÖs a name one rarely hears.
 The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlers of the Hidden Stone Village.
 Long ago, they were so famous as to be extolled
 as equals of the Aburame ClanΓÇª
 But theyΓÇÖve died out and hardly anyone remembers their nameΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 It says thereΓÇÖs been some disquiet, but there canΓÇÖt be many of them left.
 ItΓÇÖs really nothing to worry aboutΓÇª
 What's the difference?                    Don't All Insects Look Alike?
 WowΓÇª There are so many insectsΓÇª
 This is truly a paradise for insectsΓÇª
 We wonΓÇÖt get stung, will we?
 Almost none of these insects will cause bodily harm to humans.
 I do have some of the Aburame ClanΓÇÖs secret recipe insect repellantΓÇª
 but I would prefer not to use it, if at all possible.
 Because it would also repel the Bikochu.
 Then you shouldnΓÇÖt have brought it out in the first place.
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistakeΓÇª
 That kid in the leadΓÇª
 heΓÇÖs a member of the Abarame Clan, after all.
 I never imagined that weΓÇÖd bump into them in a place like this.
 Is their objective the Bikochu, Jibachi?
 Anyone who wants to get their hands on a Bikochu
 has to come to this place during this particular period.
 The restoration of the Kamizuru Clan rests on the outcome of this missionΓÇª
 We need to get our hands on a Bikochu, no matter what!
 This is a female bikochu.
 Pound its characteristics into your heads.
 Okay!
 Got it.
 Hey, IΓÇÖve seen this thing beforeΓÇª
 Hey, really?!
 Where did you see it, Naruto?
 That wasΓÇª
 When I inadvertently leave some food out, they start coming out of nowhere.
 A whole deluge of themΓÇª
 So those were BikochuΓÇª
 If itΓÇÖs those things, they should be easy to catch.
 HeyΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 Those are calledΓÇªcockroaches.
 Huh? Cockroaches?
 You're comparing apples to oranges.
 This thing is completely different!
 They look exactly identical to meΓÇª
 ΓÇô TheyΓÇÖre not! ΓÇô They're not!
 Depending on how one looks of it, this could be an opportunity.
 What do you mean, Suzumebachi?
 ItΓÇÖs been ten days since we came hereΓÇª
 we havenΓÇÖt been able to get any leads on the Bikochu.
 However, that kid from the Abarame Clan mightΓÇª
 That makes sense!
 You mean they might be able to catch a BikochuΓÇª
 From their appearance, it seems they're all Genin.
 If they're able to catch a BikochuΓÇª
 we'll just take it from them.
 All insects look alike.
 Insect Summoning Jutsu!
 There arenΓÇÖt anyΓÇªhereΓÇª
 This thing here is different too, huhΓÇª
 Huh?
 DonΓÇÖt be a burden to everyoneΓÇª
 This mission is something that I suggestedΓÇª
 so I will find it without fail!
 Byakugan!
 Just as I thoughtΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs difficult to perceive things as small as insects.
 Huh?!
 Shino! Kiba!
 HinataΓÇªDid you notice too?
 SoΓÇªyou did too?
 I guessΓÇªthey think theyΓÇÖre hidingΓÇª
 Unfortunately for them,
 we have a whole array of specialists in detecting enemies.
 What should we do, Shino? YouΓÇÖre the leader of this mission.
 If we end up in a battle, thereΓÇÖs the danger of involving the insectsΓÇª
 and injuring the Bikochu.
 As long as they don't make a move, we'll just watch them closely.
 Got it.
 I wonder ifΓÇªNaruto noticed.
 If he had noticed, he would have raised a big clamor.
 I donΓÇÖt want to stir things up. So donΓÇÖt tell him.
 OkayΓÇª
 Hey, Shino! Shino!
 I found it! I found it!
 IΓÇÖm telling you, I found a Bikochu!
 He found it already?!
 ThatΓÇÖs impossible!
 When we spent ten days searching and couldnΓÇÖt find oneΓÇª!
 Awesome, NarutoΓÇª
 Are you sure, Naruto?
 Let me see it.
 SeeΓÇªthis is it, right?
 ItΓÇÖs exactly like the photo, right?
 I might be an insect-hunting genius.
 Huh?
 Does it look the same to you?
 Huh?
 ThatΓÇÖs called a goliath beetleΓÇª
 Huh?! ItΓÇÖs not the same thing?!
 Bikochu arenΓÇÖt active at night.
 Which means thatΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs call it a day then.
 ShinoΓÇª Shino!
 I found one! This time thereΓÇÖs no mistake!
 ItΓÇÖs probably a completely different insect again.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Yeah! ThereΓÇÖs no mistake!
 Over here! Over here!
 If you donΓÇÖt hurry, itΓÇÖll fly off somewhere!
 Hey, didnΓÇÖt you bring it with you?
 I found one thatΓÇÖs resting in a tree.
 The shape of its feelers is certainly the same as Bikochu.
 And all the characteristics match.
 They do, don't they? ThereΓÇÖs no mistake itΓÇÖs this thing, right?!
 B-ButΓÇªNarutoΓÇª
 This thing is different after all, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Why is that?
 It's not only size! How would you make this one sniff scents?!
 Like this!
 This thing is called a Fake Bikochu.
 It has an extremely violent temperamentΓÇª
 It gets angry if one touches its nose and sometimes even eats humansΓÇª
 What?
 Huh?
 Hey, Shino! DidnΓÇÖt you say there werenΓÇÖt any dangerous insects!
 Almost noneΓÇª but not zero.
 KurobachiΓÇª JibachiΓÇª
 Do you really think they'll be able to catch a Bikochu?
 ΓÇô That might be difficultΓÇª ΓÇô That might be difficultΓÇª
 Unless I control my Chakra more perfectly
 I wonΓÇÖt be able to find something as small as an insect!
 To come all this way and continue trainingΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs quite admirableΓÇª
 The air pressure has changed.
 ThatΓÇÖs a sure sign that the weather will change.
 Yeah, I realize that.
 A wind charged with moisture has started blowingΓÇª
 This means thereΓÇÖs gonna be rainfall.
 When itΓÇÖs such good weather?
 But I can see clouds off in the distanceΓÇª
 HinataΓÇª
 We need to hurry.
 Because itΓÇÖs said that the Bikochu only lays an egg when it rains
 and larva emerges from the egg the following morning.
 In other words,
 if it rains today, it'll become a mature larva tomorrow morning.
 In view of the season, this may well be our last chance.
 If this chance slips by,
 it will become impossible to search for Sasuke using a BikochuΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be fine. IΓÇÖll find it without fail!
 DonΓÇÖt rainΓÇª DonΓÇÖt rain yet!
 Damn! Where is it?!
 Please come on out before it rains!
 NarutoΓÇª
 What are we gonna doΓÇª
 if those guys donΓÇÖt find a Bikochu, Suzumebachi?
 It was the Aburame Clan
 who was the catalyst in the downfall of the Kamizuru ClanΓÇª
 In order to avenge our clan's longstanding grudgeΓÇª
 we will finish them off!
 Those guysΓÇª They havenΓÇÖt made a move yet.
 They must know that weΓÇÖre searching for the Bikochu.
 Which means that they must be waiting for us to find one.
 I seeΓÇªSo their plan is to steal it from us once weΓÇÖve found one...
 What cheapskatesΓÇª
 RainΓÇª
 Not this one either!
 Damn! When I told it not to rain!
 There's no more timeΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt be a burden to everyoneΓÇª
 So ultimatelyΓÇª I contributed nothing.
 ThereΓÇÖs still plenty of time!
 NarutoΓÇª
 I will not go back on my wordΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs my Way of Ninja!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 This mission is something I suggested!
 When Naruto hasnΓÇÖt given up, whatΓÇÖs up with me giving up?!
 Hinata!
 This rain may be very advantageous to you.
 What do you mean?
 When the surrounding temperature cools,
 living creatures become easier to discern.
 Naruto, I wonΓÇÖt give up either!
 Byakugan!
 I have toΓÇª I have to concentrate moreΓÇª
 I need toΓÇª I need toΓÇª control my Chakra!
 I can see them! So those are insects!
 That insectΓÇªis wrongΓÇª
 This insect is wrong too.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 There it is!
 Naruto! On the side of that tree! ThereΓÇÖs a Bikochu there!
 I caught it!
 We did itΓÇª!
 I did it! I caught it!
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake. ltΓÇÖs a female Bikochu.
 ΓÇô Yes! I did it! 					ΓÇô CripesΓÇª
 Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!
 ThatΓÇÖs so great, Naruto!
 Hinata! ItΓÇÖs thanks to you!
 NarutoΓÇªisΓÇªhugging meΓÇª!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Akamaru?
 All right! ItΓÇÖs an egg!
 It laid an egg, huhΓÇª
 Really?
 It will emerge by tomorrowΓÇª
 So then we should make it recognize SasukeΓÇÖs scent, right?!
 SasukeΓÇª IΓÇÖll find you without fail!
 It looks like they finally found oneΓÇª
 The time has come, hasnΓÇÖt it?
 YeahΓÇª
 That NarutoΓÇª He suddenlyΓÇª
 pressed his face so close to mineΓÇª
 SoΓÇªyou were able to dodge that one just now.
 That was pretty well done for a Genin.
 TheyΓÇÖre the ones whoΓÇÖve been trailing us all this timeΓÇª
 However, I wonder if youΓÇÖll be able to escape from this attack?
 Ninja ArtΓÇªHoney Jutsu!
 Bees?!
 NoΓÇª thatΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 It looks like youΓÇÖve noticed, huh. ThatΓÇÖs honey.
 Honey that adheres like a bonding agent!
 I used up all my Chakra earlierΓÇª
 That thing is a real bee.
 NarutoΓÇª
 What do you think, Akamaru?
 I seeΓÇª
 I was convinced that those guys would make some kind of move.
 There hasnΓÇÖt been any sign of them since earlier onΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a possibility that weΓÇÖve overlooked something.
 Hey, Naruto!
 Huh?
 WhereΓÇÖs Hinata?
 She said she was gonna go wash her face.
 HmmΓÇª
 But itΓÇÖs been quite some time. I wonder what sheΓÇÖs doing?
 Could it be thatΓÇª?!
 Huh? What?
 ΓÇô Naruto! 					ΓÇô Wha--?!
 A letter on a Kunai?
 Huh?!
 We are holding the Kunoichi brat hostage.
 If you want to get her back,
 itΓÇÖll be in exchange for the Bikochu.
 Come to the top of the eastern hill later tonight.
 Damn! So that was their move!
 HinataΓÇª!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 Damn! We've run out of options!
 It's too soon to give up.
 But we don't even know where Hinata is?!
 No, there's one place Hinata is sure to appear.
 I get it! The place where the exchange will take place!
 We have one chance.
 Awright! I'll do it!
 I'll protect Hinata and the Faint Scent Beetle without fail!

 This way, I can hold on to you. Here I go!
 I-It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 The Fifth Hokage! A Life on the Line!

 This isΓÇª?!
 Way to go, Naruto.
 That Nine-Tailed Fox kidΓÇª

 I-It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 He canΓÇÖt be, reallyΓÇª
 In only one week, that RasenganΓÇª
 YouΓÇª Even after you received that JutsuΓÇª?!
 I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,
 and before I received the Jutsu I had started healing.
 The reason why Orochimaru favors meΓÇª
 is not because of my use of Jutsu or my sense for JutsuΓÇª
 It is because my recuperative power.
 The power to energize cells and make new cells.
 On the other handΓÇª IΓÇÖve used up almost all of my Chakra.
 That JutsuΓÇª seems it was NarutoΓÇÖs last effortΓÇª
 Wh-What?!
 I-It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 Even with my powers of recuperation, this much damage.
 I donΓÇÖtΓÇªhaveΓÇªenough Chakra.
 Arrhythmia!
 Drats! His heart muscle is in tattersΓÇª
 Why did that happenΓÇª?
 That moment?!
 At that moment of releaseΓÇª
 did he shred the muscles around his heartΓÇª?
 Stop shaking!
 Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.
 Are we really getting a snack? That guy looks like heΓÇÖs going to die.
 YouΓÇÖre annoying! Be quiet!
 ItΓÇÖs all overΓÇªfor Naruto.
 IΓÇªcutΓÇªhis heartΓÇÖs Chakra Network which restores the strengthΓÇª
 through the Nine-TailΓÇÖs ChakraΓÇª
 With all my strength.
 In order to eliminate the possibility that he would heal with his own power.
 There's no way he can recoverΓÇª

 Shut up!

 I want to bet on youΓÇª
 That child, heΓÇÖs not wellΓÇª
 Tsunade is a medical specialist.
 DonΓÇÖt worry, thereΓÇÖs no need to worry about NarutoΓÇÖs body.
 ThatΓÇÖs not what I meant.
 What?
 Your battle is with me, thereΓÇÖs no time to look away.
 Who would have imagined this?
 If that child is found by the Akatsuki, there will be trouble.
 In other words, if I'm to kill himΓÇª
 now is the time!
 Shoot!
 HeΓÇÖs aiming at this child!
 TsunadeΓÇª YouΓÇÖre the only one I wasnΓÇÖt going to killΓÇª
 If that child lives,
 there will be trouble in the future on a variety of levels.
 DonΓÇÖt get in my way.
 This is one childΓÇª
 This is one childΓÇª I will absolutely protect!
 Trembling at the sight of blood, why would you, one of the Sannin,
 risk your life to protect that Genin kid?
 To protectΓÇª
 my hometownΓÇªthe Leaf VillageΓÇª!
 To protect the Leaf VillageΓÇª?
 BecauseΓÇªbecauseΓÇª
 this small childΓÇª
 is the kid who will become Hokage some dayΓÇª
 What utter nonsenseΓÇª
 By the wayΓÇª to hell with Hokage!
 Only a fool does that job.
 To hell with Hokage! Only a fool does that job.
 The wishes of the twoΓÇª
 More importantly, Lady Tsunade, your wishΓÇª
 Have you forgotten your dream?
 The successive lines of Hokage have protected
 the Leaf Village and and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives for this dream, this ideal!
 Anyone who makes fun of the old man and the Fourth HokageΓÇª
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter if you are a woman!
 IΓÇÖll clobber you with all my might!
 And now, I also will put my life on the line!
 If your life is worth throwing away for a kid like himΓÇª !
 Then dying now would be a fitting end!
 All thatΓÇÖs leftΓÇªis Naruto.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Make it in time!
 SheΓÇÖs still able to move even after I pierced her down to her lungs!
 You mean youΓÇÖll still protect that kid?!
 ThatΓÇÖs what I saidΓÇª
 From nowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm putting my life on the line!
 You, half-dead corpse!
 No matter how cool you try to be, your trembling doesnΓÇÖt stop.
 You canΓÇÖt get away from the curse of hemophobia.
 And yet, why would you take the blows for that kid?
 Why would you battle for the Leaf?
 No way!
 TsunadeΓÇÖs trembling hasΓÇª
 has stopped?
 That is becauseΓÇªI amΓÇª
 the Leaf VillageΓÇÖsΓÇªFifth Hokage!
 That sign is?!
 Lady Tsunade has conquered her fear of blood,
 but thatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 What are you saying youΓÇÖll do, after all this time?
 You canΓÇÖt fight with that wound even if youΓÇÖve conquered your fear.
 W-Wait! IΓÇÖll treat that wound. So donΓÇÖt release that seal!
 Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!
 Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!
 What is this JutsuΓÇª?!
 It looks like IΓÇÖm not the only one who develops new Jutsu.
 What in the world is this Jutsu?
 WellΓÇª
 For many years IΓÇÖve stored Chakra in my forehead.
 The mass of Chakra stimulated a variety of proteins.
 The number of times my cells divide speeds to a dizzying rateΓÇª
 The cells rebuildΓÇª
 and all the organs and body systems are revitalized.
 ItΓÇÖs not the ability to restore, itΓÇÖs the ability to reincarnate.
 That means I wonΓÇÖt dieΓÇªfrom battles.
 But the number of times a personΓÇÖs cells divide in their lifetime is fixedΓÇª
 If that is sped up, it essentially shortens the life!
 Lady Tsunade!
 That action isΓÇª
 Lord Orochimaru!
 Come out!
 Hurry!

 ΓÇô Summoning Jutsu! ΓÇô Summoning Jutsu!

 On your still shoulder

 That hold us together

 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 The time to conclude this long, fateful confrontation has come, Orochimaru.
 You have sunk too deeply into vice.
 You are no longer a comrade!
 Comrade? How odious.
 That word makes me shiver.
 I will bring you down!

 Please stop it already!
 We had a rough time shaking off the bodyguards from the rip-off bar.
 I understand your point,
 but thereΓÇÖs no other way to find Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Gee, I donΓÇÖt like it either, butΓÇª
 This is truly a problemΓÇª
 But we have to do things we donΓÇÖt likeΓÇª Right?!

 SayΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt have any more money.
 I donΓÇÖt have any more money either!
 Here!

 and wait in the temple on the outskirts of town.

 Gee, how roughΓÇª lnvestigations are painful.

 I donΓÇÖt thinkΓÇª SasukeΓÇÖs in this land anymore.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?!
 We wonΓÇÖt know that if we donΓÇÖt investigate!
 Yeah, butΓÇª
 Our opponent is Orochimaru.
 Of course, things might not go easily.
 But you knowΓÇª
 But IΓÇÖm sure weΓÇÖll find him!
 Right.

 YouΓÇÖreΓÇªthe one from before?!

 Substitution, huhΓÇª?
 We let them get away.
 DonΓÇÖt worryΓÇª

 They canΓÇÖt escape from us nowΓÇª
 It seems those two are petty Ninja from somewhere.
 But getting involved with us has sealed their fate.
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunate for themΓÇª
 The objective of those who sneak into this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.
 Sure enough, the skin of a young woman is supple.

 IΓÇÖve never heard the name of such a village.

 But I really donΓÇÖt know.
 IΓÇÖve never heard of it.

 Wanna come?
 Yeah.
 His home is in the back of this alley.

 What, itΓÇÖs a seedy old man! Hey! HeΓÇÖs got money, right?

 If so?
 Interesting!
 WeΓÇÖve reduced ourselves to being thieves,

 A Ninja, huhΓÇª
 Then I donΓÇÖt need to go easy on you.
 DonΓÇÖt be acting like a big shot, old man!
 Shut up, you squirt!
 A Ninja refers to one who endures.
 Those who couldnΓÇÖt endure their hunger pangs
 and resort to use their diligently studied Jutsu for stealing
 are not called Ninja!
 I wonΓÇÖt let that pass!
 Thinking weΓÇÖre fellow Shinobi, we took pity on you.
 Acting all conceited!

 So my nameΓÇÖs known in this land, tooΓÇª
 Well, itΓÇÖs okay.
 So is it true that you know about Village Hidden in the Sound?
 Yes! There were many Ninja clans in the Land of Rice Paddies,
 including us Fuma.
 We divided up the roles amongst ourselves
 and the Ninja of this land were doing well in their own way.
 Until that man appearedΓÇª
 Who was that man?
 ItΓÇÖs regrettable to even speak of that nameΓÇª
 It was Orochimaru!
 ItΓÇÖs okay! Rest easy!
 If germs get into the wound and you get tetanus,
 you wonΓÇÖt be saved.
 But fortunately, I have medicine, so let me treat you.
 TheyΓÇÖre not coming.
 Just show us your wound.
 Well, huh?
 Naruto, go wait outside till my treatment is done. 164.01	01:37:53:04	01:37:53:24	Huh?
 Why do I have to be the only one chased out?!

 DonΓÇÖt peek!

 Okay, show me your wound.

 To hit me out of the blueΓÇª?
 Whoa, interesting.
 Naruto! You can come in!
 What?!
 A cute girl?
 Sakura! This girl! Who the heck is this girl?!
 How dense. ItΓÇÖs the Ninja from a moment ago.
 Come to think of itΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª?
 I am Sasame Fuma.
 SasameΓÇª Why were you being chased by those guys?
 If you like, try talking about it.
 We might be able to help.
 They were the Sound Ninja protecting OrochimaruΓÇÖs residence.
 What?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry for mistaking you guys as one of them the other day.
 That doesnΓÇÖt matter!
 WeΓÇÖre also looking for Orochimaru!
 Would you please give us the details?
 OkayΓÇª
 It all started with the Feudal Lord of the Land of Rice Paddies
 launching an attack on a neighboring land
 in an attempt to expand the territory.
 The Land of Rice Paddies is a small landΓÇª
 And there arenΓÇÖt that many Shinobi.
 It was a foolhardy attack. Losing was expectedΓÇª
 And the Shinobi clans of this land
 who participated in the losing battle went to ruinΓÇª
 We the Fuma Clan as well.
 I hear that among the surviving Shinobi,
 there are those who have left the land
 and those who have stooped to become thieves.
 Even so, weΓÇÖve lived believing in a restoration of the clan
 and continued to live hiding in the shadows.
 At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden in the Sound appeared before us
 attempting to create the first full-scale Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.
 The emissary of the Sound Village saidΓÇª
 My master Orochimaru is gathering all sorts of Jutsu!
 He has taken an interest in your Jutsu well.
 Depending on your work,
 you might be given the chance to serve the Feudal Lord!
 My cousin ArashiΓÇª
 was an up-and-coming star for the restoration of the clanΓÇª
 Arashi as a representative of the clan
 headed for Village Hidden in the Sound together with the emissary.
 ButΓÇª
 And thenΓÇª?
 We waited for a notice from Arashi, butΓÇª
 There is no word from him, huh?
 Damn it! He was tricked by that Orochimaru!
 Naruto!
 OhΓÇª!
 Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi might be safeΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt know, right? And soΓÇªand soΓÇª
 IdiotΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖm going to save Arashi!
 I have a small body and my power is weak.
 So no matter what I didΓÇª
 I did nothing but become a hindrance even in Ninjutsu trainingΓÇª
 But Arashi always saved me!
 Everyone in the village has already given up, butΓÇª
 So IΓÇÖll find Village Hidden in the Sound aloneΓÇª
 And so you were chased by the Sound Ninja, right?
 This time, itΓÇÖs my turn to save Arashi!
 Sasame!
 IΓÇªI want to be of help to Arashi!
 Naruto!
 YeahΓÇªI know!
 We have to go to Village of the Sound to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!
 Now instead of one,
 itΓÇÖs just that there are two guys for us to bring back.
 IΓÇÖll save your cousin, Sasame!
 Right!
 Eew! A spiderΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Naruto!
 Wha--! WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!
 My cute children made a path for me out of silver thread
 and told me where you guys were going.
 All three of you together will descend into hell while bearing the secret!
 Naruto! ItΓÇÖs the Ventriloquism Jutsu!
 HeΓÇÖs scattering his voice to multiple directions
 and covering up location and number!
 I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!
 ItΓÇÖs a large number, but itΓÇÖs just Clone Jutsu.
 No. Look closely, Jigumo!
 The threads are getting tangled.
 All of the clones are tangible?! Shadow clones?!
 If soΓÇª Kagero!
 UnderstoodΓÇª
 Come out!
 Borne to be born, lived to live, one sunrise and one sunsetΓÇª
 The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.
 Thinking that such a fleeting life is pitiable is, in fact, pitiableΓÇª
 Know that IΓÇÖm at my best
 when living in the dark and deep in the ground!
 Ninja Art:
 Ant Lion Jutsu!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle

 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 Darn it! What a pesky bunch!
 But I wonΓÇÖt be done in so easily!
 I have to kick that Orochimaru jerkΓÇÖs butt
 and bring back Sasuke and SasameΓÇÖs cousin!
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter if you guys are powerhouses!
 IΓÇÖll kick all of your butts, so bring it on from anywhere!

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,

 The Promise That Could Not Be Kept
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª
 WhereΓÇÖs Sasuke?
 Kakashi!
 How is Naruto UzumakiΓÇÖs condition?
 HeΓÇÖs okay.
 What about Sasuke? WhereΓÇÖs Sasuke Uchiha?!
 How are the other Genin?
 Yes! By Lady HokageΓÇÖs order,
 the first and second medical corps have been dispatchedΓÇª
 The wounded from all areas have already been gathered.
 They were convoyed after administering emergency treatment.
 How are their conditions?
 Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuriesΓÇª
 Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries, but itΓÇÖs not life-threatening.
 Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi are in serious conditionΓÇª
 At this point, thereΓÇÖs no telling what will happen.
 EveryoneΓÇª
 The ingredients and effects of the medicine
 have been thoroughly researched.
 ExcellentΓÇª
 Now bring the deer antler!
 Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 How is heΓÇªBig Sister?
 No walks for him for quite a whileΓÇª
 The muscles of his limbs have been severely damaged.
 YouΓÇÖre a vet, right, Big Sister? CanΓÇÖt you somehowΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖll be okay.
 ItΓÇÖll take time. But thereΓÇÖs no threat to his life, so rest easy.
 Walks for you are out of the question for quite a while, too!
 Yeah, I knowΓÇª
 Intensive Care Unit 7
 ItΓÇÖll soon be three hoursΓÇª Please take over.
 All right!
 Although weΓÇÖre making this kidΓÇÖs hair into a conductor,
 please donΓÇÖt mistake the cellular rate of the deficient parts!
 Right!
 As for the Chakra control, handle it as if weΓÇÖre threading a needle!
 Understood!
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 ThereΓÇÖs no point in you getting frustrated, right?
 Missions come with sacrificeΓÇª
 You took the mental training, right?
 Training and actual battle are different, you knowΓÇª
 I know what missions are aboutΓÇª
 And I thought I knew what the Shinobi world is like.
 I became a platoon leader for the first time on this mission.
 With that, I understoodΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not cut out to be a Shinobi.
 Surprisingly fragileΓÇªfor a man.
 This timeΓÇª
 The only thing I was able to do as platoon leaderΓÇª
 was to believe in everyone.
 I was na├»veΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt have enough powerΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs all my fault!
 Are you afraid of getting hurt?
 ShikamaruΓÇª
 Are you going to be argued down by a girl and run away?
 ItΓÇÖs a dragΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt want to have arguments. IΓÇÖm not a woman.
 YeahΓÇª But youΓÇÖre not a man, either.
 YouΓÇÖre just a coward!
 Even if you quit being Shinobi, the missions will continue.
 Someone has to do it.
 Your comrades will just be dispatched againΓÇª
 under a different platoon leader.
 And your comrades might die there.
 But if at that time, you were the platoon leaderΓÇª
 your comrades might be saved from that happening to them.
 If you reflect on this time, make use of the experience and learn,
 you might be able to carry out missions with more perfection.
 If you really think your comrades are important to you,
 before you think about running awayΓÇª
 think about becoming more exceptional for the sake of your comrades!
 ThatΓÇÖs what real comrades are, you coward!
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 HeΓÇÖs okay, now!
 The antidote has stopped the death of cells
 caused by the side effects of the Pills.
 You were a big help this time, Shikaku!
 The Nara ClanΓÇÖs secret medicinal preparation manual was very useful.
 It mustΓÇÖve been tough to make something like thatΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the result of day-to-day study.
 ThanksΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade!
 Neji HyugaΓÇª His safety line has been secured.
 And, thereΓÇÖs some informationΓÇª
 Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki have just now returned.
 Although seriously injured, it seems itΓÇÖs not life-threatening.
 Two, huh?
 ShikamaruΓÇª lt seems the mission is a failure.
 But, everyone is alive! ThatΓÇÖs the most important thing.
 Next time for sureΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll carry out the mission perfectly!
 SasukeΓÇªYouΓÇÖre the chosen one.
 WhateverΓÇª Just give me ΓÇ£power.ΓÇ¥
 Even though the form is different, itΓÇÖs still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes.
 If you donΓÇÖt want to die, use more care in how you talk.
 Wh-What? This quality of ChakraΓÇª
 YesΓÇª My future is inside this kidΓÇª
 Hidden Leaf Hospital
 IΓÇÖm going to where Orochimaru is!
 PleaseΓÇªbring back Sasuke!
 IΓÇÖll bring Sasuke back without fail! I promise that on my life!
 OhΓÇªYou were awake, huh?
 Shikamaru!
 IΓÇÖm going on ahead to Choji! What about you?
 IΓÇÖm going on ahead toΓÇª Naruto and Sasuke!
 I seeΓÇª So everyoneΓÇÖs okay. ThatΓÇÖs good.
 Then, SasukeΓÇª
 YeahΓÇªhe's gone.
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 Then, I still canΓÇÖt see himΓÇª?
 YeahΓÇª But Lady Tsunade said that he should regain consciousness soon.
 Thank goodnessΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs really a great help that
 Lady Tsunade returned to the Leaf Village.
 If she hadnΓÇÖt, right about now, Choji would beΓÇª
 The Lady FifthΓÇªHokage.
 YouΓÇÖve come to visit?
 Information sure travels fast.
 SakuraΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 I heard you suffered quite a serious injuryΓÇª
 But you look well, considering.
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª SakuraΓÇª
 Why do you apologize?
 Being you, you probably got reckless again, right?!
 Jeez, you look like a mummyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª IΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª The weatherΓÇÖs nice today. So open the curtains.
 Sakura! IΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll keep my promise, no matter what!
 I promised on my life. ThatΓÇÖs what I said, so IΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs okay already, NarutoΓÇª
 Sakura! HeΓÇª
 I alwaysΓÇª
 said that, soΓÇª IΓÇª
 I stick straight to what I say!
 ThatΓÇÖs my Way of Ninja!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Thanks, NarutoΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll get right to healing this injury and IΓÇÖve got to bring Sasuke back!
 Wh-What was that?!
 PerΓÇªPervy Sage?!
 Yo!
 IΓÇÖve come today to tell you something important.
 From here on, as my official disciple,
 IΓÇÖll train you to become a full-fledged Shinobi in three years.
 Three yearsΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖve received some credible information from a certain source
 concerning the ΓÇ£Akatsuki.ΓÇ¥
 AkatsukiΓÇª
 It seems that it will be three or four years
 before they come after you next.
 I donΓÇÖt care about that!
 Talking about stuff thatΓÇÖs so far down the roadΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt have the time to be doing slowpoke training!
 What do you mean?
 If I donΓÇÖt go after Sasuke immediately,
 he might be killed by Orochimaru!
 ΓÇ£ImmortalΓÇ¥ doesnΓÇÖt mean that the flesh is being maintained as is.
 Before his body decays,
 a strong and new flesh will be made into a vessel for his soul.
 It seems youΓÇÖve learned of the true purpose
 for Orochimaru seeking SasukeΓÇª
 Huh?! Then that means you also knewΓÇª?
 I was looking into OrochimaruΓÇÖs Immortality Jutsu.
 It seems with that Jutsu,
 he canΓÇÖt reincarnate into the next body for three years.
 And unable to wait for Sasuke, he just recently reincarnatedΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be okay for three years from nowΓÇª There is time.
 ThatΓÇÖs not a lie, is it?!
 Not a lie, is it?!
 NopeΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 Forget about SasukeΓÇª
 Sasuke went to Orochimaru on his own accord.
 No matter what you do, he wonΓÇÖt change.
 IΓÇÖve seen many Shinobi, so I knowΓÇª
 Sasuke is the same kind as Orochimaru.
 If youΓÇÖre thinking about bringing him back, just forget it.
 ThatΓÇÖs something an arrogant fool would do!
 He may be nothing to you but heΓÇÖs my friend!
 Would a friend hurt his comrade?!
 Take a look at your current plight!
 This isΓÇª!
 Why? Why would youΓÇª?
 We were called Sannin togetherΓÇª
 WerenΓÇÖt we comrades since we were kids?!
 In every regard, youΓÇÖre a foolish guy, JiraiyaΓÇª
 You lack thought in everything you do.
 ThatΓÇÖs why you didnΓÇÖt notice what I was doing.
 CanΓÇÖt you rethink it, Orochimaru?
 Absurd!
 How can you be so stupid?!
 No matter how much I wanted itΓÇª
 in the end, there was no way he would come back.
 After the agony, all thatΓÇÖs left was my own powerlessness and regret.
 I donΓÇÖt want you to go through the same thingΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre going to go after Sasuke, then thereΓÇÖll be no training.
 IΓÇÖll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you
 and depending on the case, prohibit you from leaving the village.
 YouΓÇÖre not just an ordinary kidΓÇª
 You possess the Nine Tail Fox that the Akatsuki is after!
 This is serious. I'll just have to do thatΓÇª
 if youΓÇÖre going to act on your own without listening to what I say.
 Eventually, youΓÇÖre going to have to deal
 with guys more troublesome than Orochimaru.
 Give up on Sasuke.
 Sooner or later this was going to happen.
 DonΓÇÖt suffer anymore! Forget and dismiss him.
 ItΓÇÖs not just Jutsu or powerΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre a Shinobi, develop eyes that can make the right judgment.
 And if youΓÇÖre going to live as a Shinobi, become wise.
 If you remain a foolΓÇª
 the reality is that it will be tough living in this world.
 Fine.
 If thatΓÇÖs what being wise isΓÇª
 Then IΓÇÖm fine being a fool for life!
 Even if by myself,
 IΓÇÖll create even more awesome Jutsu and save Sasuke no matter what!
 And, and, IΓÇÖll even kick the AkatsukiΓÇÖs butt!
 If someone like you were to do it aloneΓÇª
 the best youΓÇÖd be able to come up with
 would be some stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.
 It might somehow work out
 if you are a big fool and not an ordinary foolΓÇª
 Be prepared once youΓÇÖre out of the hospital,
 you big fool.
 See you then.
 Roger!
 ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs been seven years sinceΓÇª ΓÇô ΓÇªall the members gathered like this.
 Since Orochimaru left the organization.
 That Orochimaru has gotten the Sharingan.
 ItachiΓÇªYour little brother?
 DonΓÇÖt get hasty. Yeah.
 WeΓÇÖll kill Orochimaru eventuallyΓÇª
 More importantly, there are only three years left.
 Can everyone accomplish the work required of them?
 Huh?
 Yes, our goal isΓÇª
 to get everything, including the Nine Tail Fox in question!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇÖs been weird all along ever since Sasuke left.
 I canΓÇÖt put it well,
 but sheΓÇÖs gloomy or fretting or something.
 On top of that she says, ΓÇ£This time IΓÇÖll do my best on my own.ΓÇ¥
 What the heck does that mean?
 ItΓÇÖs bugging me, itΓÇÖs bugging me!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time for me to be relaxing in the hospital!

 NarutoΓÇª!
 He came in totally late.
 Hmm? WhereΓÇÖs Sasuke?
 The Dosu guy IΓÇÖm supposed to fight isnΓÇÖt here, either.
 Hey, you guys over there.
 Throw out your chests and show your faces to the spectators!
 You guys are the stars of this ΓÇ£final roundΓÇ¥!
 Sasuke hasnΓÇÖt been found yet?
 A team of several Anbu members are searching all over,
 but they have found nothing.
 He might already be in the hands of OrochimaruΓÇª
 If thatΓÇÖs the case, we may never find him.
 I understand.
 Well-wellΓÇª Lord Kazekage.
 You must be tired having come all this way.
 NoΓÇªIΓÇÖm glad the arena is in the Leaf Village.
 Even though youΓÇÖre still young, it would probably be a tough journey for you
 if you had to go to the trouble of traveling someplace else.
 ShouldnΓÇÖt you decide on the Fifth Hokage soon?
 Please donΓÇÖt treat me like an old person.
 IΓÇÖm still planning on being Hokage for another five yearsΓÇª
 Now then, I guess itΓÇÖs about time to begin.
 Everyone, thank you very much for coming
 to the Village Hidden in Leaves Chunin Exam.
 We will now begin the ΓÇ£final roundΓÇ¥ matches
 for the eight who made it through the preliminaries!
 Please watch until the end!
 If there are supposed to be eight, it looks like thereΓÇÖs one missing.
 I have something to tell you before the match.
 Look at this.
 Huh?!
 There was a slight change to the tournament.
 Check who youΓÇÖll be facing one more time.
 Here, I had more preliminary matches than the othersΓÇª
 So the Dosu guy dropped out?
 I thought IΓÇÖd pound you hereΓÇª
 If I did that, thereΓÇÖd be the possibility for me,
 as the one remaining after the first battle, to fight Sasuke.
 W-What are you?!
 SayΓÇª
 ΓÇªsay.
 What?
 UmmΓÇªSasuke still hasnΓÇÖt come.
 WhatΓÇÖll happen?
 I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak out of the hospital room at that time.
 Something couldΓÇÖve happened to himΓÇª
 In case a competitor does not arrive by the start time of his matchΓÇª
 he or she will lose by default!
 It doesnΓÇÖt make sense.
 Knowing his character, heΓÇÖd come even if he had to drag himself.
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 To verify my existenceΓÇª one more time.
 One more time.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong? You should still be able to move, right?!
 Sasuke! Come on!
 Could it beΓÇª?
 Even after I warned him to avoid doing anything to stand outΓÇª
 He didnΓÇÖt kill that Sasuke Uchiha also, did heΓÇª?
 Listen up, you guys.
 The terrain is different, but the rule is that there are no rules,
 the same as in the preliminaries.
 The matches will continue until one or the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.
 However, if I judge that it has been settled, IΓÇÖll stop the match there.
 Arguments will not be allowed.
 Understood?
 So the first match isΓÇª
 Naruto Uzumaki.
 Neji Hyuga.
 Just those two remain and the rest of you go to the waiting room.
 Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!
 Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.
 Uh-huh.
 This match will be quite interesting!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Say, Sakura.
 I understand that youΓÇÖre worried about Sasuke.
 But why donΓÇÖt you cheer for Naruto at least a little bit?
 Hmm. YouΓÇÖre right.
 That being said,
 with Neji as his opponent, Naruto has no chance of winning.
 That isΓÇª!
 Not so, is what youΓÇÖre going to say?
 But to think that brat would survive until this pointΓÇª
 I wonder if this is as far as it goes
 for those who survived just by luck, after all.
 That Naruto.
 This is not a good opponent at all.
 No matter how you look at it, he canΓÇÖt beat the Hyuga clan.
 Well, thatΓÇÖs what I thought at the beginningΓÇª
 But youΓÇÖll all be surprised if you underestimate him.
 Akamaru, whatΓÇÖs wrong?
 What did you say?!
 What?! Where?!
 There!
 WhatΓÇÖs Anbu, the Black Ops, doing here?
 Is something going onΓÇª?
 You seem like you want to say something.
 I said it before, too, didnΓÇÖt I?
 A failure is a failure. You canΓÇÖt change.
 I promise ΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll win, no matter what!
 He has the lookΓÇª of being sure of himselfΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs as if heΓÇÖs not all worked upΓÇª
 That makes it more worthwhile for me.
 I look forward to your look of disappointmentΓÇª
 when you know the true realityΓÇª
 Stop whining.
 LetΓÇÖsΓÇªget started!
 Now then, round one.
 Begin!
 Watch carefully, Hanabi.
 Nobody has inherited such a strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.
 To say nothing of your older sister.
 More than big sister?
 Perhaps more than you, too.
 This time, itΓÇÖs not an opponent that can be managed easily.
 He has that Byakugan.
 Close combat is no goodΓÇª
 Does Naruto know that?
 Idiot! Why would anyone attack from the front?!
 No! Naruto.
 The opponent can see your Chakra Points!
 They're called Chakra Points.
 If those pressure points are pressed accuratelyΓÇª
 the flow of an opponentΓÇÖs Chakra can be stopped,
 amplified or controlled at will.
 Uh-oh!
 I missed, huhΓÇª?
 In other words, heΓÇÖll press the pressure point if I get too close
 and IΓÇÖll become unable to use Jutsu.
 That means all I can do is fight from a distance.
 You understand, right? You have no way of winning.
 HehΓÇª All I did was to verify your power.
 The real fight is just getting started!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You used your head, didnΓÇÖt you, Naruto?!
 With the Shadow Clone JutsuΓÇª
 Heh. HeΓÇÖs an interesting kid.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu is a Jonin level technique.
 To think he could use such an JutsuΓÇª
 Who knows how thisΓÇÖll turn out?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributed among the clones,
 indeed, I canΓÇÖt detect the real one even with my Byakugan.
 But thereΓÇÖs only one real one, after all!
 Heh. DonΓÇÖt be acting tough!
 If youΓÇÖre going to come, then come.
 ItΓÇÖs pointless.
 In front of that NejiΓÇÖs defense, itΓÇÖs not just all attacking.
 Hey!
 DonΓÇÖtΓÇªyouΓÇªunderestimateΓÇª
 ΓÇªme!
 Here they come!
 He hit!
 Fool.
 Wha--?!
 Dang it!
 IΓÇÖll get you next time!
 Here!
 This guyΓÇª
 Does he have eyes behind himΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖre going to becomeΓÇª the HokageΓÇª?
 With this level, itΓÇÖs impossible.
 I can generally tell with these eyesΓÇª
 Intrinsic abilities are set.
 Figuratively speaking, everything inherent about people is set.
 WhyΓÇª?
 Why are you always so judgmental like that?
 ThenΓÇªare you going to say that anybody can become the HokageΓÇª
 if they just work hard?
 Only a very small percentage of Shinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokage are born with a destiny.
 ItΓÇÖs not something you become by trying to become it.
 ItΓÇÖs determined by destiny.
 People must live within their different respective currents
 that canΓÇÖt be defied.
 The one singleΓÇª destiny everyone has equallyΓÇª
 ...is death.
 Those eyesΓÇª
 He still holds a grudge against the head family, huh?
 SoΓÇª
 So what?!

 It canΓÇÖt be helped that the Anbu are dispersed and deployed
 in important areas in the village.
 Huh?
 ItΓÇÖs about to begin.
 We shouldnΓÇÖt let our guard down, but for nowΓÇª
 We need to pay attentionΓÇª  to this match.
 Kakashi, IΓÇÖll be carefully checking out what sort of training you gave himΓÇª
 as your eternal rival!
 Huh? Did you say something?
 No! YouΓÇÖre slick, Kakashi!

 taste good.
 His conversationΓÇÖs started. This is dangerous.
 This is the first time IΓÇÖve seen Gaara get like that before fighting.
 So it must mean his opponent is that imposingΓÇª
 Him.
 It appears heΓÇÖs calmed down.
 Come on.
 HeyΓÇª
 Do you rememberΓÇª what he said yesterday?
 At that timeΓÇª
 I will killΓÇªyou all without fail.
 Just wait.
 ThatΓÇÖs what he saidΓÇª
 But he didnΓÇÖt do it.
 It was the perfect opportunity, butΓÇª
 he didnΓÇÖt even see us.
 Now, let me feel it!
 We'reΓÇª
 unsatisfactory for him.
 Right now, the only one who can make him feel anythingΓÇª
 ΓÇªis only Sasuke!
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myselfΓÇª
 And if I see that all other people in this world
 exist only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.

 His speed is basically the same as LeeΓÇÖs with the weights removed.
 ItΓÇÖsΓÇª ItΓÇÖs exactly like LeeΓÇÖs Taijutsu.
 His speed is also completely different from before!
 SasukeΓÇª You are indeed a genius beyond imagination.
 How many years did it take me to attain that speedΓÇª?
 And you attained it in a mere monthΓÇª!
 However, it seems to consume a lot of stamina
 to continue that movement.
 WhatΓÇÖs Gaara planning to do?
 The sand armor uses up too much ChakraΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt last for very long.
 What the heck sort of training did you do?!
 Hm?
 To get to that level in a mere monthΓÇª
 Sasuke had copied LeeΓÇÖs Taijutsu with Sharingan.
 So during the Taijutsu trainingΓÇª
 I had Sasuke image LeeΓÇÖs movements.
 Sasuke could make that movement his own
 only because he knew Lee.
 Of course, Sasuke had to work very hard for it.
 ButΓÇªwith only thatΓÇª
 With only TaijutsuΓÇª that Sand guy canΓÇÖt be taken down!
 That KakashiΓÇª
 He must have seen the battle
 between the hateful Gaara and the lovable Lee.
 Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
 canΓÇÖt work against an opponent that even Lee couldnΓÇÖt take down.
 He should have known this only to well.
 So if thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇª
 Why is it that he had Sasuke master only Taijutsu?!
 Why did I keep living?
 But as long as youΓÇÖre alive, you need a reasonΓÇª
 If you donΓÇÖt have one, itΓÇÖs just the same as being dead.
 What's this guy saying?!
 So this is the answer I came toΓÇª
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowing when I might be murdered,
 finally, I became calm.
 Oh?
 ShikamaruΓÇª
 We need to go over to where Kakashi Sensei is right now!
 WhatΓÇÖre you planning to do?
 Hey!
 I'm going toΓÇª
 stop this match!
 Gaara couldnΓÇÖt possibly be planning to use that Jutsu!
 So he used all the sand for protectionΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt think there could be this much of a difference in the hardness
 with a difference in the density of the sand.
 So itΓÇÖs absolute protection.
 The sandΓÇª ltΓÇÖs covered his entire body.
 This is somewhat troublesome.
 Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto!
 Huh? What do you want?
 Sensei! Please stop this match right away!
 That guy is totally different from us!
 HeΓÇÖs not normal!
 NarutoΓÇª 					WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 He lives to kill people.
 In any caseΓÇª
 If this continues, Sasuke will die!
 Jin, Saru,
 Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, SaruΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake about it. ltΓÇÖs that Jutsu!
 This isnΓÇÖt good! Our plan isnΓÇÖt even on GaaraΓÇÖs mind.
 Shoot!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Everyone makes mistakes ltΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught
 LetΓÇÖs go carve the badges in our chest Yes, itΓÇÖs Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes ltΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
 Even if one understands visually,
 it's meaninless unless one can move physically.
 I was filled with a sense of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you haveΓÇªSharingan!
 Next time, ΓÇ£Late for the Show, But Ready to Go! 		The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!ΓÇ¥

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?

 Sand Coffin!
 IΓÇÖll do it.
 No! Please back me up.
 I got sand in my mouthΓÇª
 P-Please let me go!
 You wouldnΓÇÖt be able to do anything in your current stateΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll do it.
 Please be careful!
 That guy attacks with bones!
 Like earlierΓÇª
 he does things like shoot bones and extrude bones from inside his bodyΓÇª
 He controls bones freely!
 Gaara of the DesertΓÇª
 You use sand, as the name implies, huhΓÇª?
 Gaara vs. Kimimaro
 Tough defense using sandΓÇª
 HeΓÇªisnΓÇÖt a close-range combat typeΓÇª
 Getting close would be difficult, huh.
 It's coming!
 Digital Shrapnel!
 ThereΓÇÖs no waste in his movementsΓÇª
 Sure enough, heΓÇÖs a considerable Taijutsu user.
 Attack and defense are oneΓÇª
 He attacks and defends with sand, huh?
 However, the amount of sand he can control is probablyΓÇª
 ΓÇªabout the amount of sand inside the gourd.
 Gaara of the DesertΓÇª A dopey nickname.
 You canΓÇÖt do anything if you donΓÇÖt have sand.
 Going to the trouble of walking around carrying heavy sand
 is the very proof of that.
 Sand ShowerΓÇª
 How triteΓÇª
 As long as I have sand, I can do anything.
 YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs dopeyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs easy for me to do things like create sand with dirtΓÇª
 I get itΓÇª
 With his own sand he grinds things like rocks and minerals in dirt
 and makes it into sand.
 So he was sending his own sand beneath the ground
 and adding new sand, huhΓÇª?
 Gaara of the DesertΓÇª
 His nickname isnΓÇÖt just for display.
 Excellent!
 You did it!
 Not yet.
 Sand Burial!
 IΓÇÖm reminded of that man when I look at that guy.
 Huh?
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 He had the same eyes as that guyΓÇª
 The same eyes?
 Wanting to verify the value of oneΓÇÖs own existenceΓÇª
 Such eyesΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke.
 YouΓÇÖre here, arenΓÇÖt you?! At least answer me!
 WhatΓÇÖs gotten into you?!
 I donΓÇÖt hate the darknessΓÇª
 The darkness is where I was brought upΓÇª
 Why am IΓÇªin a place like this?
 Did I do something wrong?
 Is there really GodΓÇª?
 If there is, why confine me in a place like this?
 WhoΓÇÖs there?
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter who I amΓÇª Get out!
 Kimimaro, the time has come to use youΓÇª
 Huh?
 For our sake, for the Kaguya ClanΓÇª
 Fight!
 YesΓÇª To fight.
 That isΓÇª
 the only thing I can do now.
 N-No wayΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs quite some pressureΓÇª
 I wouldΓÇÖve been flattened just like that
 had I not made a membrane of bone just below the skin.
 BonesΓÇªThat guyΓÇÖs a monster, too.
 ItΓÇÖs a troublesome body, isnΓÇÖt it?
 I underestimated youΓÇª
 But, I wonΓÇÖt be caught by your sand anymore.
 Sand Tsunami!
 WowΓÇª ItΓÇÖs beyond the scope of
 escaping from the sand or not getting caughtΓÇª
 To think it would change the terrain itselfΓÇª
 YouΓÇªYou did it.
 Not yet.
 Giant Sand Burial!
 H-HeΓÇÖs so strongΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs gotten even stronger than when he fought me.
 ButΓÇªthis time for sureΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs a persistent guyΓÇª
 Huh?!
 IΓÇÖm stillΓÇªaliveΓÇª
 ThenΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs still significance for me to live.
 From now, weΓÇÖre going to launch a night attack
 on the Hidden Mist VillageΓÇª
 As they are disconcerted from that incident,
 now is the perfect time for us to make them realize our ferocity!
 Make them realize the ferocity of the Kaguya Clan!
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Right!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Kimimaro? Get going!
 I donΓÇÖt know what to doΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt need to think deeply about it.
 Go down to the Hidden Mist Village
 and kill every last person you encounter!
 Just act on your instincts!
 Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?
 NoΓÇª
 I-I seeΓÇª Excuse me!
 Haku?
 OhΓÇªno. ItΓÇÖs nothing, Zabuza.
 We donΓÇÖt have time to be stopping. LetΓÇÖs hurry!
 Right!
 He had the same eyes as IΓÇª
 Before I met ZabuzaΓÇª
 Hold it!
 YouΓÇÖre a hasty one, arenΓÇÖt you? IΓÇÖm not from this village.
 The thing you are after is right thereΓÇª
 Now, go.
 It seems to have begunΓÇª
 The Kaguya ClanΓÇª
 Fools who can only find their own path of life by fightingΓÇª
 It was long ago
 when a simple-minded group that just enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.
 With a governed organization as an opponent,
 they just become fools rushing towards death
 if they fight only with powerΓÇª
 Are we the only survivorsΓÇª?
 It seems weΓÇÖre surroundedΓÇª
 The defense was tighter than we thought.
 We have no choiceΓÇª
 Now itΓÇÖs come to this,
 take along with you every person you can!
 WeΓÇÖll have them entertain us as much as possible!
 What do I fight forΓÇª?
 What am IΓÇª?
 Without knowing anything, I just kept on fighting.
 The time has come to use youΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm neededΓÇª
 That was the only thing that got my body moving.
 AndΓÇª
 I was also able to figure out thatΓÇª
 I couldnΓÇÖt live if I didnΓÇÖt fight.
 Dawn brokeΓÇª
 And I learned thatΓÇª
 I myself was the only one to survive.
 Again, IΓÇÖm all aloneΓÇª
 By myself, I just wandered aimlessly from place to place.
 This isΓÇª
 The flower, from back thenΓÇª?
 Why are you blooming in a place like this?
 Why wonΓÇÖt you answer?
 YouΓÇÖre ignoring me, too, huh?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way youΓÇÖd be seen by someone in a place like this, yet youΓÇª!
 ThatΓÇÖs enoughΓÇª
 MaybeΓÇªthereΓÇÖs no significance to living.
 But you might be able to discover something interesting
 by continuing to liveΓÇªright?
 Like how you discovered that flowerΓÇª
 Like how I discovered you.
 Okay, LetΓÇÖs goΓÇª
 Back thenΓÇª Lord Orochimaru said that, butΓÇª
 People are born with some kind of significance.
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thinkΓÇª some kind of important mission.
 The mission for meΓÇª
 is to protect Lord Orochimaru and his ambition.
 WhatΓÇÖsΓÇªthat?!
 Come back, Sasuke! EveryoneΓÇÖs worried about you!
 Damn itΓÇª ltΓÇÖs so dark I canΓÇÖt see anything!
 YouΓÇÖve got better eyes than me.
 Sasuke is in the darkness nowΓÇª
 N-Neji?!
 YouΓÇÖll be unable to catch up with Sasuke
 if you stop in a place like thisΓÇª
 Neji!
 YeahΓÇª YouΓÇÖre right! This isnΓÇÖt the time to stop.
 Just wait! IΓÇÖll take Sasuke back home no matter what!
 Sasuke!
 Sand Coffin!
 That formΓÇª?!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak

 Mystery of the Targeted Merchants
 Did they really come this way?
 But why come this way?
 They shouldnΓÇÖt come this way if itΓÇÖs as you say, Choji.
 I said that because I didnΓÇÖt think we were being targeted.
 I donΓÇÖt think this is the time to argueΓÇª
 We have to formulate some sort of strategy.
 You say that, butΓÇª
 What is it?
 Have the guys you spoke of caught up?
 Then we should divide up this group in two.
 Here itΓÇÖs hard enough to protect one.
 WhatΓÇÖs the point of dividing  the group in two?
 N-Naruto!
 Please, tell us what your idea is.
 This is what I mean.
 For exampleΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs say there are  ten persimmons here.
 Is anything okay if itΓÇÖs a food?
 Yeah.
 Then I want it to be ramen!
 Naruto, itΓÇÖs an example, soΓÇª
 Then weΓÇÖll make it ramen.
 Someone is after these ten bowls of ramen.
 And there are three people  to protect the ramen.
 And so one person has to protect roughly three bowls.
 No, no. If itΓÇÖs ramen,
 we should just eat it all before they come.
 That would settle things.
 N-Naruto. This ramen is for delivery to someone,
 so we canΓÇÖt eat it.
 Really? But the ramen wonΓÇÖt be tasty if it gets soggy.
 IΓÇÖm moving on.
 If three people protect ten bowls of ramen,
 one person protects about three bowls.
 But this ramen has legs for escaping.
 Ramen with legs for escaping?!
 Five bowls of ramen quick to escapeΓÇª
 and five bowls of ramen slow to escape.
 Right, right.. Things are kind of getting crazy.
 I see. If we divide them into two groupsΓÇª
 Of course, the pursuers would target the group that is slow to escape first.
 So we have one person  defend the preceding group
 and two people for the group that is slow to escape.
 Right, right.
 By doing this, as for protecting  the slow group,
 now one person can just protect two and a half bowls.
 Oh!
 In other words, the ramen that are quick to escape are the young people
 and the ramen that are slow to escape are the elderly people and children, right?
 Exactly. Not only will the possibility of
 the former to completely get away increase,
 the burden on the latter to protect will decrease.
 ItΓÇÖs a strategy that kills two birds  with one stone.
 YouΓÇÖre smart.
 HoweverΓÇª the elderly people and children willΓÇª
 I just stated a rational idea.
 ThereΓÇÖs the possibility
 of complete annihilation if we stay in a group.
 Am I wrong, Yurinoshin?
 WellΓÇª
 Then itΓÇÖs settled. LetΓÇÖs divide everyone up in two.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, gramps.
 DonΓÇÖt worry about it.
 It would be trouble if something bad were to happen to the men in their prime.
 YouΓÇÖve got a wife and kid at home, right?
 Then weΓÇÖll be going on ahead first, Naruto, Choji.
 Right. WeΓÇÖre counting on you, Hinata.
 Naruto and I will deal with the pursuers.
 Right. IΓÇÖll protect them well.
 Lady Haruna.
 Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut. WhatΓÇÖs your mission?
 Is it not to protect me?
 Things will be settled if Kikusuke defeats those guys.
 Then shall we get going, too?
 IΓÇÖm counting on you, Brother Choji.
 Right! 					Leave it to me!
 Choji.
 You go on ahead.
 What?
 IΓÇÖm going back to check things out at the place where the traps are.
 But if you do that, you may encounter  the pursuers along the wayΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs fine.
 Doing something like waiting  to be attacked isnΓÇÖt my style!
 Naruto!
 Leave it to me!
 I meantΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no point to our strategy
 if I have to protect five people  by myself.
 Right, thereΓÇÖs no point.
 We came down that path,
 so the trap should be up ahead somewhere.
 I guess IΓÇÖll take a shortcut!
 WhatΓÇÖs this? 					What happened?
 Why is it so wet?
 WhatΓÇÖre these wounds?!
 This guyΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Are you serious?
 Is something wrong, Brother Choji?
 No, nothing.
 I seeΓÇª
 I feel it.
 Even I can sense this much bloodlust.
 ItΓÇÖs close now.
 Huh?
 Rain?
 This is the worst. Rain wipes out all presence of the enemy.
 OhΓÇª
 This rain is weird.
 Gather around, everyone!
 Stay close to me.
 WhatΓÇÖsΓÇªthis?
 This is bad!
 What was that now?!
 Everyone! Get under the cart!
 WeΓÇÖre already under here!
 YouΓÇÖre quick!
 Choji!
 Naruto!
 Get down!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! Could you say so at the start
 if youΓÇÖre going to use paper bombs?
 All right. It seems theyΓÇÖre gone.
 Why did they disappear?
 IsnΓÇÖt it obvious?
 They have no business with a shop that doesnΓÇÖt have the thing they want.
 Thing they want?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 If a shopΓÇÖs sold out of the item you want,
 youΓÇÖd go to another shop, right?
 Could it be that the thing that he wants is in the other group?
 What does that mean?!
 HinataΓÇÖs in danger!
 Everyone, leave your stuff here and take only what you need!
 Hinata is?!
 Everyone, weΓÇÖll put up our tents here  for today and rest.
 ItΓÇÖs dangerous to move in the dark.
 Hey!
 We finally caught up.
 Naruto, Choji. What is it?
 ΓÇ£What is it,ΓÇ¥ nothing. The situation has changed.
 It seems someone among these people
 is hiding something important.
 Something important?
 It should probably have something to do with us being chased.
 But who is hiding what?
 ItΓÇÖs most likely you guys, Shun and Yurinoshin.
 DonΓÇÖt be silly! WhatΓÇÖre you saying weΓÇÖre hiding?
 DonΓÇÖt play innocent!
 Kikusuke has been killed by someone!
 What?!
 Kikusuke was?!
 DonΓÇÖt play innocent!
 Kikusuke has been killed by someone!
 What?!
 Kikusuke was?!
 Why should he have to suit up like a Shinobi,
 fight those guys and then get killed?!
 ItΓÇÖs not necessary to tell you guys.
 But if thatΓÇÖs why weΓÇÖre being chasedΓÇª
 It means you guys are putting everyone in danger.
 If you donΓÇÖt tell us honestly,
 we wonΓÇÖt be able to protect  even what we can protect.
 KikunojouΓÇª
 Kikunojou?
 You mean Kikusuke?
 YesΓÇª And my name isnΓÇÖt Yurinoshin.  ItΓÇÖs Yurinojou.
 Stop, Yurinojou!
 The person here is Lady Haruna,
 the only daughter of the feudal lord of the Land of Greens.
 Princess?!
 Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens. YouΓÇÖve grown up so muchΓÇª
 P-PrincessΓÇª?
 You were a woman?!
 Lady Haruna, it is as these people say.
 We must not put everyone in danger by hiding the truth any further.
 But why is someone like a princess  mingling among merchants?
 There was information of a coup in the Land of Greens.
 A coup?
 The Land of Greens was a small, but calm and peaceful land.
 However, it was by no means a prosperous land.
 Before we realized it,
 more than half of the public officials  had been bought off.
 Who in the world would do thatΓÇª?
 The ringleaders are three brothers called the Janin,
 evil Ninja who came from  across the sea.
 Janin?
 Yes. TheyΓÇÖre guys who use a particular type of Ninjutsu
 and are called as such because of their frightfulness.
 TheyΓÇÖve taken many lives and think nothing of it
 if itΓÇÖs for their own gains.
 They treat people like wormsΓÇª
 But why the Land of Greens?
 I donΓÇÖt know why.
 But his lordship had Lady Haruna hide amongst a group of merchants
 and got her out of the land.
 Kikunojou and I were left with the protection of the princess,
 but we were insecure with just the two of us.
 So then we hurriedly commissioned the Hidden Leaf
 under the pretext of protection from bandits.
 Why didnΓÇÖt you tell us  something that important?
 ThereΓÇÖs no way I could have. My escape is top secret.
 Besides, what would happen  if I were to have told you?
 The end result wouldΓÇÖve been  you guys running away in confusion.
 No way would I do something  like run away.
 Kikunojou might not have had to die if
 we had understood the situation  from the start.
 I wonder.
 One of you guys mightΓÇÖve ended up like Kikunojou.
 WeΓÇÖre actually fine.
 But to think youΓÇÖd go so far as to involve the old lady and the children.
 It couldnΓÇÖt be!
 Were you intending to use  the old lady and the kids as decoys
 and escape just yourself?!
 ThatΓÇÖs right. What of it?
 Choji! Hinata!
 As for me, IΓÇÖm really tickedoff right now!
 So what of it?!
 If something should happen  in the land,
 I would become the only blood relative
 of the feudal lord of  the Land of Greens.
 If I can just survive, things could be restored someday,
 even if the Land of Greens were to be destroyed.
 Say what?! Just what is it you think of peopleΓÇÖs lives?!
 Please forgive her.
 Yurinojou.
 Is it not your mission to protect me?
 YouΓÇÖre still talking about such thingsΓÇª?
 Please wait, Naruto!
 Lady Haruna, thatΓÇÖs true for me.
 However, these people are different.
 The mission they undertook was to protect merchants.
 It was not to protect us.
 Indeed, what we heard about
 was a D-rank mission to protect all of the merchants.
 Protecting a prominent figure of a land is an A-rank mission.
 The rank differs by far too much.
 Are you guys saying youΓÇÖre going to forsake me?
 WerenΓÇÖt you saying until just now
 that you didnΓÇÖt trust people like us?
 IΓÇÖll protect you with my life, Lady HarunaΓÇª
 Shut up, Yurinojou! Kikunojou was your senior disciple.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you alone could defeat an opponent
 whom he couldnΓÇÖt defeat!
 That will just be our destiny when that happens, Lady Haruna.
 Watch, Brother Choji.
 Oh! Awesome, awesome.
 IΓÇÖm sorry about earlier.
 It happened so suddenly, I couldnΓÇÖt stop.
 DonΓÇÖt be concerned about me.
 However, please forgive Lady Haruna.
 The Land of Greens is a small land.
 For the sake of the landΓÇÖs survival,
 Lady Haruna was kept under  the custody of another land,
 as a hostage all by herself since she was little.
 Hostage?
 It frequently happens in a small land in a war-torn world.
 When Lady Haruna returned  from the other land,
 she had completely lost her feelings of trust towards people.
 Lady Haruna is also a victim of a turbulent world.
 ThereΓÇÖs a village
 about one league down  the mountain from here.
 For the time being,
 weΓÇÖll leave the old woman  and the others there.
 Be careful now.
 You guys, too!
 Bye!
 Why are you separating them from us?
 They still have value for my personal use.
 Are you still going on about that?
 They went so far as to discard  their merchandise for your sake.
 Then we should also leave this place.
 We must not.
 If we go into hiding,
 thereΓÇÖs a possibility of that group being attacked again.
 Exactly. This time, itΓÇÖs our turn to be the decoy
 in order to protect them.
 Do as you like!
 Hinata, IΓÇÖll take care of things here. Please rest a while.
 Yeah, do that.
 Th-Then, if you insist.
 Oh, yeah. Here. Kikunojou was holding this.
 Thanks, Naruto.
 Kikunojou was a master of the Flower Ninjutsu
 passed down in the Land of Greens.
 We learned together  when we were little
 and I couldnΓÇÖt beat him even onceΓÇª
 Now I have forever lost  the chance to beat him.
 NoΓÇª You still have a chance.
 What?
 If you beat the guy who defeated Kikunojou,
 you will have beaten Kikunojou!
 NarutoΓÇª YouΓÇÖre exactly rightΓÇª!
 Here they come!
 Other than the fact that the enemy uses water,
 we have absolutely no idea what theyΓÇÖll come at us with.
 I know.
 Go! Flower Ninja Art:! Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage.
 What?!
 He changed the trajectory in mid-air?!
 Oh, no!
 I finally got you!
 Gotcha.
 To think youΓÇÖd make me look like a fool.
 So you finally show yourself.
 I will avenge Kikunojou!
 Try it if you can.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 Too bad. YouΓÇÖre one person short.
 IΓÇÖve set a share for one more.
 I donΓÇÖt know about that.
 First, IΓÇÖll take care of you, boy.
 Water Style: Liquid Memory!
 NarutoΓÇª!
 And this!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What is it?
 Is thatΓÇª?
 The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?!
 Vanish and die!
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 What is this huge thing?
 I donΓÇÖt wanna become its food.
 Let me tell you one thing. IΓÇÖm not tasty.
 IΓÇÖm not tasty, either.
 But Choji would be more worthwhile to eat.
 No, Naruto would be tastier.
 Be eaten for the sake of your comrade.
 YouΓÇÖre the one who will become it food.
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be arguing  about stuff like that.
 Yurinojou!
 Anyway, we just have to run with all our might for now!

 because we were always together

 With regard to the next requestΓÇª
 What, thereΓÇÖs more?
 Yes.
 Boy oh boyΓÇª
 This is the last one so please try to focus.
 All right.
 When the weather continues to be warm like thisΓÇª
 And whatΓÇÖs the request?
 About the escort for the convoy with the fugitive who was securedΓÇª
 What about it, thatΓÇÖs hardly a difficult mission.
 Well, actually thereΓÇÖs a bit of a problem.
 Please look at this.
 I see. This is somewhat of a nuisance.
 All of the Jonin are out on S-rank missions,
 and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin have been allocated elsewhere.
 WhoΓÇÖs left?
 LetΓÇÖs seeΓÇªwellΓÇª
 Multi-Clone Jutsu!
 LetΓÇÖs go, Bushy Brows!
 Here goes, Naruto!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 You jerk!
 Another serving of Shadow Clones for you!
 You ainΓÇÖt seen nothing yet!
 You let your guard down!
 Pretty good, Bushy BrowΓÇª
 The same to you, NarutoΓÇª
 Naruto! Lee!
 Hey, are you guys all right?
 Hey, stop moving.
 Sakura, canΓÇÖt you be a little more gentle?
 Shut your mouth. Really, youΓÇÖre being reckless.
 ThatΓÇÖs not true, Sakura.
 See, the 100-man Shadow Clone grapples
 are excellent training for enhancing oneΓÇÖs Taijutsu skills.
 ItΓÇÖs like killing two birds with one stone for Naruto, too
 because this kind of friendly training lets him polish
 his Shadow Clone skills at the same time.
 ThatΓÇÖs exactly right.
 What are you talking about? All youΓÇÖre doing is slugging it out.
 This is what ends up happening when two guys get together.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Anyway, this isnΓÇÖt the time to be acting carefree like that.
 Lady Tsunade is calling for you.
 Grandma Tsunade?
 What does she want?
 Ninja Dropouts?
 Yeah. 					Ninja Dropouts are
 Rogue Ninja who, of their own free will,
 choose not to be Shinobi and leave their respective villages to join up.
 TheyΓÇÖre a gang of thieves who use brutal and villainous means to steal.
 ThatΓÇÖs horribleΓÇªusing their abilities as Ninja for criminal purposes.
 ThatΓÇÖs unforgivable.
 One of their members was captured yesterday
 in Ogi Pass in the Land of Forests.
 This guy is the only member
 whose wanted notice is circling around the lands.
 He was found wandering about and taken prisoner.
 His name is Gantetsu.
 For a former Ninja, thatΓÇÖs pretty lame.
 Gantesu is being taken to the capital city of the Land of Forests
 in order to do an exhaustive investigation into this matter
 for the purpose of wiping out the Ninja DropoutsΓÇª
 However, there is a possibility that the Ninja Dropouts will try
 to rescue him along the wayΓÇª
 A police escort has been sent from the capital
 so it is fully prepared for the convoy.
 But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,
 the idea is that Shinobi would be the best countermeasure for Shinobi,
 so they requested that the Leaf Village also send out some Ninja.
 ThatΓÇÖs what this request is all about.
 IΓÇÖm getting excited! IΓÇÖll show ΓÇÿem how great Leaf Ninja are!
 ΓÇôGot it! ΓÇôLetΓÇÖs give it a shot!
 All right! Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee.
 The three of you are assigned to the mission
 of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
 ΓÇôYes, maΓÇÖam! 					ΓÇôRoger!
 Look, the harbor.
 HuhΓÇª So theyΓÇÖre gonna transport him in this.
 The only way to get to the capital of the Land of Forests is
 to go up this river.
 Hey, look over there.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu.
 Are you the Leaf Ninja?
 Yes. Uh, and who are you?
 IΓÇÖm Tsuzumi with the police department.
 IΓÇÖm supervising this convoy.
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 This guy hereΓÇÖs Bushy Brows and her name is Sakura Haruno.
 HmmmΓÇª You guys are still kidsΓÇª Are you really Ninja?
 We sure are.
 Huh, we might not look it,
 but weΓÇÖre all full-fledged Ninja whoΓÇÖve been tested by fire numerous times.
 WeΓÇÖll display our skills for you at some point.
 Just leave it to us.
 Well, I have a strong team of experts handling security,
 but if it ever comes to that,
 IΓÇÖm counting on you to use your specialty, Ninjutsu.
 Got it.
 Those are the security personnel guarding the prisoner.
 TheyΓÇÖre all dressed alike, arenΓÇÖt they?
 Huh, they donΓÇÖt have much style.
 Naruto, thatΓÇÖs rude.
 Captain Todoroki!
 What is it, Commander Tsuzumi?
 These people came from
 the Village Hidden in the Leaves as reinforcements.
 The nameΓÇÖs Naruto Uzumaki.
 IΓÇÖm Sakura Haruno.
 My name is Rock Lee.
 Commander, I told you already.
 We already have enough security on this.
 CanΓÇÖt be helped. ltΓÇÖs something the bosses decided.
 There wonΓÇÖt be any role for you guys to play.
 We will guard Gantetsu.
 I promise that on this sword.
 HuhΓÇª That swordΓÇÖs nothing.
 Snapping that thing in half would be as easy as apple pie.
 Yeah, with just one finger.
 Stop it, you guys! Please excuse themΓÇª
 Be careful not to get seasick.
 Well, I leave it to you.
 Y-Yes, sir. Thanks.
 GantetsuΓÇª
 All rightΓÇª
 Put the cage into the belly of the ship!
 OkayΓÇªOkayΓÇª
 Okay, lower it!
 WowΓÇª
 This feels great!
 What the heck is this anyway?
 They wonΓÇÖt let us even get near him.
 TheyΓÇÖre totally treating us like nuisances.
 If only those Ninja Dropout guys would launch an attack,
 we could show them how awesome we are.
 DonΓÇÖt say stupid things like that.
 The best scenario would be that the Ninja Dropout wonΓÇÖt show up at all.
 Our mission is to transport Gantetsu safely to the capital, you know.
 But this is getting too boringΓÇª thereΓÇÖs no thrill to it.
 Better just grin and bear it.
 There are missions like this too.
 Well, I sure understand how you feel, Naruto.
 YeahΓÇª I guess this is getting a little boring.
 Dig inΓÇª
 Gimme a breakΓÇª
 Who do those guys think we are?
 But this stuff is pretty good.
 Yeah, very tasty.
 It makes me so madΓÇª
 I mean, why did we go to all the trouble of coming all this way?
 IΓÇÖm gonna do my mission.
 Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu.
 But the captainΓÇÖs gonna scold you.
 IΓÇÖm doing this out of Ninja pride!
 Uh, Naruto!
 Naruto!
 He does have the face of a criminal after all.
 Todoroki?
 What the heck is he doing here?
 AkioΓÇª!
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!

 Akio!
 Damn!

 What was it you were about to do just now?!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud.
 Oh?
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Sakura?
 Lee, over there.
 ThatΓÇÖs strangeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve never knew this river has a tributary.
 Why are you in here?
 Why does that matter?
 What were you about to do to Gantetsu!?
 What are you talking about?
 It looked to me like you were going to kill him.
 Huh? Me? ThatΓÇÖs a stupid thing to say.
 ItΓÇÖs my mission to guard this guy. Why would I?!
 Yeah, I guess.
 Even if he is a criminal,
 you canΓÇÖt just kill him off without interrogating him first.
 A brat talking like he knows, huh?
 There isnΓÇÖt any need to interrogate him!
 This is the guy who did it!
 Huh?
 This guyΓÇª
 These guysΓÇªslaughtered a lot of people without mercyΓÇª
 Even innocent children.
 If things continue like this, weΓÇÖll be sucked into the tributaryΓÇª
 What should we do?!

 Yes, somehow. More importantly, what happened?
 I donΓÇÖt know.

 ItΓÇÖs a big mistake to think that anything can be resolved with money!
 There are times when you have to use your own power!
 There hasnΓÇÖt been anything that I couldnΓÇÖt do with money so far!
 YouΓÇª Are you always like this?
 With that personality, you canΓÇÖt make friends!
 ItΓÇÖs okay ΓÇÿcause I can buy friends with money!
 WhatΓÇª?
 YouΓÇª Buy friends? You meanΓÇª
 If I give ΓÇÿem money, everybody will be my friend!
 KunihisaΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why I hate country Ninjas.
 TheyΓÇÖre cheap and stink of povertyΓÇª
 Stupid!
 Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa!
 Running made me hungry.
 Take this and buy a boxed lunch!
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing like a store to buy lunch around here.
 Well, snacks will be fine!
 ThereΓÇÖs no convenient store or candy shopΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre useless! This is why I hate the country!
 Stupid Naruto.
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 Oh, Young Master!
 Oh!
 Little fish, little fish!
 LetΓÇÖs eat!
 The kid must be stupid to get caught in this cheap trick.
 DonΓÇÖt you agree, Bro?
 Yeah!
 Huh? Naruto?!
 Aw man, youΓÇÖre really high maintenance.
 Those two guys just nowΓÇª
 They were going to catch you!
 They were plotting a kidnapping, whateverΓÇª
 WhateverΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm often a target, because I have money.
 Often a targetΓÇª? YouΓÇª
 More importantly, I want to eat more fish!
 Go find a shop and buy some.
 YouΓÇª Still think you can do anything with money?
 All right, watch this!
 Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto!
 HowΓÇÖs that?!
 You can just get things using your own power without using money.
 EvenΓÇª without using money?
 Damn!
 He attacked us by surprise, that cowardly bastard.
 IΓÇÖll give it back to him doubled!
 Well, waitΓÇª
 If we do it thoughtlessly, weΓÇÖll just get creamed again.
 So what do we do?
 WeΓÇÖll use that thing.
 That thingΓÇª?
 Look close at the movement of the fishΓÇª
 Aim for the instant when they fall after jumping up.
 DonΓÇÖt get hasty.
 Now!
 Oh!
 That was close!
 O-One more time, Naruto!
 IΓÇÖll get the Kunai knife, so one more time!
 Master Kunihisa!
 ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs deep over there! ΓÇô Please be careful!
 I know, I knowΓÇª
 Where did it go?
 I think itΓÇÖs in this area, butΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away this time!
 You guysΓÇª
 We hired these guys with the money you threw away.
 It means that now, theyΓÇÖre on our sideΓÇª
 Hey, you guys! IΓÇÖll pay you double what those guys did!
 So be on my sideΓÇª
 Wh-What theΓÇª?
 Looks like youΓÇÖve run out of money.
 How about you guys over there? Wanna join us?
 WeΓÇÖll pay up stacks of money.
 Humph! These guys have been with me for a long time.
 That paltry sum wonΓÇÖtΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre not going along with your selfish acts any longer!
 Y-You guys?!
 No! I donΓÇÖt like it!
 Annoying brat. IΓÇÖll have to tie you up so you wonΓÇÖt move.
 What are you doing, Kunihisa?!
 Naruto, IΓÇª IΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs fine already!
 Hey youΓÇª IΓÇÖll pay you double what you get for your mission.
 WonΓÇÖt you hand that brat over to us?
 WeΓÇÖre just going to demand ransom money from his parents is all.
 We wonΓÇÖt kill him. Relax and hand him over.
 I-ItΓÇÖs not enough? Here, how about this?
 NarutoΓÇª
 Kunihisa! Ride on my back!
 O-Okay.
 S-Still not enough, huh? Here! ThatΓÇÖs all of it! Take it!
 Like I saidΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a big mistake to think you can obtain anything with money!
 Crap!
 After them!
 Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa.
 Okay!
 Damn! I canΓÇÖt move with him on my back!
 I canΓÇÖt see the bottom, NarutoΓÇª
 Go!
 Okay! You go on ahead.
 What?! Go on ahead?!
 There he is! LetΓÇÖs get him!
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 ItΓÇÖs okay! Hurry up and jump!
 I-I canΓÇÖtΓÇª IΓÇÖm scared, Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs not scary, cΓÇÖmon!
 I canΓÇÖtΓÇª IΓÇÖm scaredΓÇª!
 Damn it!
 Do it!
 Naruto!
 Well, youΓÇÖre coming with me!
 Hurry! Kunihisa!
 B-ButΓÇªΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okayΓÇª You can definitely do this! Believe it!
 Prepare yourself!
 No way!
 Go Kunihisa!
 Oh, Big Brother!
 Huh?! Kunihisa?!
 It hurts!
 IΓÇÖm going to clean those guys out and then IΓÇÖll be right over!
 So wait a second!
 D-DarutoΓÇª
 D-Darudo!
 The wallΓÇÖs collapsingΓÇª Escape!
 How long are you guys gonna be on top of me!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Wh-Wh-WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 I have to go to him!
 There are times when you have to use your own power!
 Use my ownΓÇªpower!
 You can just get things using your own power with out using money.
 Even without moneyΓÇª
 with my own power!
 I canΓÇªdo this!
 Just one step short!
 Naruto!
 Kunihisa!
 No! A little bit more!
 ΓÇô We did it! 					ΓÇô We did it!
 All right!
 I-It hurts butΓÇª IΓÇÖm scared butΓÇª
 IΓÇª!
 YouΓÇª What a face?!
 KunihisaΓÇª
 You did a good job!
 Darudo!
 Wha--?! Hold on, donΓÇÖt drip snot!
 But Naruto!
 Stop it!
 WellΓÇª See ya!
 Yeah! Next time you come play at my house, Naruto!
 Okay!
 ReallyΓÇª You took great care of him. Thank you!
 Yeah, wellΓÇª
 Well thenΓÇª
 YesΓÇª
 Papa, Papa!
 What is it, little Kuni?
 Look, itΓÇÖs sparkly and prettyΓÇª
 But it has no value, itΓÇÖs just a marble, little Kuni.
 ThatΓÇÖs true, PapaΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 As long as it's pretty, it doesn't matter whether it's valueless, right?
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 All right, IΓÇÖm fired up! Our mission this time is a treasure hunt!
 But your recent low mission success rate concerns me.
 No need to worry. WeΓÇÖve got a map, so itΓÇÖll be a cinch!
 IΓÇÖve thought about it, you seeΓÇª
 No need to think, believe it!
 If you fail this missionΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be okay, I tell you!
 YouΓÇÖll all start over again from the Academy!

 Sakura's Determination
 WhereΓÇÖs Sasuke! Where did you put him?!
 Heh! YouΓÇÖre Naruto, right?
 You wouldnΓÇÖt believe anything I said anyway, would youΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs right! I wonΓÇÖt believe that SasukeΓÇÖs dead!
 NarutoΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right. Sasuke is alive.
 IΓÇÖll bring Sasuke back!
 I made that promise!
 NarutoΓÇª
 In that case, take me down!
 If I were the wimp I was in the past,
 I would probably have told you the truth.
 Arashi!
 No! The old Arashi is dead!
 The person you see here is just a block of flesh
 kept alive by Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!
 Sakura, please look after Sasame!
 Stop it, Naruto! DonΓÇÖt fight with Arashi!
 No!
 This guy isnΓÇÖt the same gentle Arashi you once knew, Sasame!
 Jigumo! Go!
 No!
 Sasame! I'm sorry!
 Over here!
 Naruto!
 DonΓÇÖt, Sakura!
 KamikiriΓÇª!
 Finish him!
 Naruto!
 YouΓÇÖreΓÇªnextΓÇª!
 Sakura!
 That was closeΓÇª
 I almost let my guard down.
 Just when you had a chance to launch a sneak attack.
 You blew it, didnΓÇÖt you, Naruto?
 Naruto!
 All because of that ball and chainΓÇª!
 Ball and chainΓÇª?!
 NarutoΓÇª I'm sorry!
 ThatΓÇÖs not true at all!
 This kind of injuryΓÇª
 is nothingΓÇªat all!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 If thereΓÇÖs three on your side,
 I'll go with five on mine!
 Kamikiri!
 Naruto!
 Are you all right?!
 YouΓÇÖre badly hurtΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª This injury is nothing!
 ΓÇ£SakuraΓÇªThis injury is nothing!ΓÇ¥
 Stop it! If you say more than thatΓÇª!
 I wonΓÇÖt say more! IΓÇÖll bring this to an end.

 Boar, Dog, Rat, Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,
 Dog, Monkey, Dragon, Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, DragonΓÇª
 Why does Arashi know that technique?
 ItΓÇÖs a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefs of the Fuma clan could useΓÇª
 What was that?!
 Fuma Ninja Art:
 Spell of the Mandala!
 This ainΓÇÖt good!
 Naruto!
 What the heck is this?!
 This is the end!
 What?!
 Naruto!
 The Chakra cage gradually shrinksΓÇª
 And the human enclosed therein is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.
 You canΓÇÖt break it.
 As long as I myself do not dissolve the Jutsu.
 Naruto!
 IΓÇÖm incapable of doing anythingΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing IΓÇÖm capable of doingΓÇª
 The person I am now isnΓÇÖtΓÇª
 capable of doing anything!
 Arashi!
 SasameΓÇª
 You!
 Sasame!
 PleaseΓÇªcome to your sensesΓÇª
 Become the old Arashi again!
 I told you, already!
 The old Arashi is dead.
 ArashiΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry, SasameΓÇª
 I wanted powerΓÇª
 I wanted the Fuma Clan to find a place in the sun once againΓÇª
 Yes! I understand that! I understand that!
 But, enough nowΓÇª LetΓÇÖs go home.
 LetΓÇÖs go back to the village.
 But, IΓÇÖm just a mere monster nowΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not true!
 This is agonyΓÇª

 PleaseΓÇªkillΓÇª
 How dare you try to kill me!
 Arashi!
 YouΓÇÖllΓÇªdie!
 Sakura!
 Sakura?!
 You wanna beΓÇª the first to die?
 Sasame taught me thatΓÇª
 dying isnΓÇÖt anything to be scared of!
 I seeΓÇª
 But whatΓÇÖs scary is to live oneΓÇÖs life without having been able to do anythingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not afraid to die in the service of someone who is important to me!
 DonΓÇÖt!
 IΓÇÖm telling youΓÇª
 Whatever happens, you mustnΓÇÖt dieΓÇª No matter what! Sakura!
 Naruto!
 Give it up!
 What is it you think youΓÇÖre capable of doing the way you are now?!

 Stop that, Arashi!
 SasameΓÇªyou!
 Naruto!
 Hey! Let go!
 No!
 Arashi?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry, SasameΓÇª
 I caused you so much hardshipΓÇª
 No, you havenΓÇÖt!
 The person who experienced the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!
 Is there anything I can do for you?
 What should I do for you?!
 YouΓÇÖve already helped me more than enoughΓÇª
 SeeΓÇª Thanks to you, Sasame,
 I was able to return to being the person I was in the pastΓÇª
 Naruto!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Even if itΓÇÖs to be of service to someoneΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no life that should be lost for that!
 Yeah!
 Run! Sakura!
 Pervy Sage!
 Sorry to be late!
 I was faced with a number of obstacles on my end too!
 Gimme a breakΓÇª
 Now thenΓÇª Climb on, climb on!
 Hurry! LetΓÇÖs get back above ground!
 Oops!
 Sasame!
 SheΓÇÖs fineΓÇª She just fainted.
 Naruto!
 Orochimaru assigned us a missionΓÇª
 To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back
 to the Village Hidden in the Leaves under any circumstances!
 Then, Sasuke isΓÇª?!
 YeahΓÇª HeΓÇÖs alive!
 Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke
 because he is his vital vessel which he will possess in three years!
 ArashiΓÇª
 ArashiΓÇª This place is gonna collapse!
 Hurry up and come over here!
 IΓÇÖm already just a puppetΓÇª
 I cannot live my life anywhere except here.
 ArashiΓÇª
 All right!
 No! Arashi!
 SasameΓÇª
 Thank you.
 Including Arashi, weΓÇÖve paid an extraordinary price butΓÇª
 The Fuma Clan has been able to cut itself free
 from OrochimaruΓÇÖs spellΓÇª
 You can start again anew.
 I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!
 With this lifeΓÇª that Arashi protected.
 Yeah!
 I am truly indebted to you.
 SasameΓÇª
 Hanzaki, IΓÇÖm leaving these two in your hands!
 Yes, sir! Please take care along the road!
 I will.
 ΓÇô Thank you! ΓÇô We thank you!
 ΓÇô Take care! ΓÇô See you again!
 Hey! Hang in there!
 Well, we werenΓÇÖt able to find Sasuke,
 but at least we now know that heΓÇÖs alive somewhereΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll have to settle for the fact that we were able to ascertain
 the new information that we still have a grace period of three years
 before he becomes a vessel to be possessed by Orochimaru.
 YesΓÇª
 Sasame knew what she needed to do for her clanΓÇª
 But this time again all I did was cry.
 All I did was depend on NarutoΓÇª
 Sakura!
 You gave your best effort too!
 No, I was just a ball and chain to everyoneΓÇª
 I wasnΓÇÖt capable of doing anything aloneΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not true!
 Seeing you give your best effort like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.
 If you hadnΓÇÖt been there, Sakura, IΓÇÖd have been crushed just like that.
 ItΓÇÖs thanks to you, Sakura!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Wow, youΓÇÖve grown into someone who can say that sort of thing!
 Oww! IΓÇÖm an injured man! Treat me with a little more care!
 Oh yeah, thatΓÇÖs right!
 All I was thinking about at that time was protecting someone I cared aboutΓÇª
 What IΓÇÖm capable of doing right nowΓÇª
 I was thinkingΓÇª
 What?
 There are many variables such as mission level,
 or platoonΓÇÖs member structureΓÇª
 But no matter how small a platoon might be,
 I think itΓÇÖs important to assign one Medical Ninja to itΓÇª
 I know that alreadyΓÇª
 I wrote exactly the same thing in a report long ago
 regarding the survival rate and mission achievement rate of small platoons.
 But itΓÇÖs not that easy to nurture Medical Ninja.
 They require a different set of skills than that of fighting types NinjaΓÇª
 The minute perfection of Chakra control,
 the ability to assimilate a huge volume of specialized knowledge,
 the brains to apply that in a broad wayΓÇª patienceΓÇª
 And there is the most important thing
 for Shinobi who are to develop into a Medical NinjaΓÇª
 Well, IΓÇÖm busy right now, soΓÇª
 The most important thingΓÇªhuh?
 Hidden Leaf Hospital 		 IΓÇÖm all wrapped up in bandages againΓÇª
 This way I canΓÇÖt even hold chopsticksΓÇª
 Sakura, when itΓÇÖs time for my meal, feed me, okay?
 IΓÇÖll open up my mouth just like this andΓÇª
 Huh? Sakura?
 IΓÇÖm sorry! I was just joking!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª NarutoΓÇª
 Huh?
 This is gonna mean that IΓÇÖll keep you waiting a little butΓÇª
 Next time, I definitely wonΓÇÖtΓÇª
 be a ball-and-chain to you!
 Huh?
 Enter!
 I came here with a request!
 What is it?
 Please make me your apprentice!
 YouΓÇÖre very desperate, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Sakura Haruno,
 I heard from Kakashi that you have a brilliant mind as well as will power!
 All right.
 But in exchange, IΓÇÖm not gonna be easy on you!
 Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 This recent missionΓÇª
 looks like it wasnΓÇÖt wasted on her, after all.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 He makes me so angry, that Pervy Sage!
 DidnΓÇÖt he say ΓÇ£IΓÇÖll make you my disciple and hone your skillsΓÇ¥?!
 When SakuraΓÇÖs already become the Old Lady Tsunade's
 and is working so hard!
 And he just leaves me to my own devices! Hey!
 All because he was assigned a mission by Old Lady Tsunade!
 If things come to this,
 IΓÇÖm gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade a piece of my mind!

 Well, cΓÇÖmon girls. All of you, come onΓÇª
 Welcome!
 Ah, that was refreshing.
 W-We've been robbed!

 Where! Where is it?!
 ""If you want your necklace back, give back the money""?
 ""Will wait at the three cedars on the mountain behind.""

 What are they talking about?
 Girls came in, all right.
 ButΓÇª
 theyΓÇÖre all female monkeys!

 Hey, here I am!

 What do you want, kid?!
 ThatΓÇÖs my line!
 I havenΓÇÖt borrowed any money from you people!

 ΓÇô Bring it on! 					ΓÇô Cheers!
 I want to bathe with womenΓÇª
 Huh? So the one who borrowed money is Old Lady Tsunade?
 YesΓÇªnicknamed ΓÇ£the Legendary Sitting Duck.ΓÇ¥
 She played at the Akagi gambling den until she was penniless.
 We loaned her what she lost.
 ThatΓÇÖs right, and thereΓÇÖs an I.O.U.
 Wha--?! There are so many zeros!
 IΓÇÖm Senta, this guy is called Bunzo.
 The boss ordered us to collect on the debt three years agoΓÇª
 We set out on a journey from Akagi Mountain
 prepared not to return until we get the money back.
 WeΓÇÖve heard rumors about the lady here and thereΓÇª
 But, she sure was something.
 She was elusive and quite hard to find.
 Then recently, we caught some information that sheΓÇÖd appeared.
 We were waiting on the side of the roadΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs when we came along with Old Lady Tsunade.
 But why did you raid the room so stealthily?
 Rumor has it that
 that ordinary means don't work against the ΓÇ£Legendary Sitting Duck.ΓÇ¥
 We didnΓÇÖt think that if we tried to collect amicably,
 she would pay us.
 SheΓÇÖs certainly stingyΓÇª
 We heard that she cherished the necklace next to her life,
 so we thought sheΓÇÖd pay in exchange for it.
 No way. After all, you raided my room.
 We never even dreamed that the owner of the necklace would have changedΓÇª
 ErrΓÇª CanΓÇÖt you ask the lady to pay?
 Uh, even you say so...
 Please! If we donΓÇÖt get the money back, we canΓÇÖt go home!
 Our wives and kids are waiting for us to come home!
 ΓÇô PleaseΓÇªIΓÇÖm begging you! ΓÇô PleaseΓÇªIΓÇÖm begging you!
 ItΓÇÖs all goneΓÇª
 Bad luckΓÇª Darn it. IΓÇÖm stone broke.
 Well, letΓÇÖs call it quits with pachinko.
 ItΓÇÖs about time for a bathΓÇª
 ΓÇô ShizuneΓÇª 					ΓÇô Yes?
 My bag is at the front desk of the inn.
 What?! Y-You canΓÇÖt mean to bring it here?!
 Everything to your name is in itΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve just lost! I canΓÇÖt repress this feeling!
 Just bring it without complaint.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Huh? Could you beΓÇª
 Y-You areΓÇª!
 There are women, all rightΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 I was hoping for younger, more titillating womenΓÇª
 This one, right?
 Thank youΓÇª
 Are you with Ms. Tsunade?
 Yes.
 This came for her not long agoΓÇª
 To Tsunade 		A letter? I wonder who couldΓÇÖveΓÇª?
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Huh? Lady Tsunade!
 SheΓÇÖs not hereΓÇª
 Okay, TontonΓÇª
 You know to search for Lady Tsunade, right!
 What, impossible? Why?
 I see! The smell of the sulfur from the hot spring interferesΓÇª
 Well then, the only way to search for her is on foot!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Where are you!
 We have a problem!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Oh, what in the world should I do?
 We have Naruto Uzumaki.
 If you want him returned unharmed, please return all of the money you owe!
 We'll wait by the three cedars on the mountain behind. The Akagi Family
 What should I do? I have to help Naruto.
 On top of that, if itΓÇÖs discovered that Lady Tsunade has a huge debt,
 talk of her installment as the Fifth Hokage will probably end.
 ThatΓÇÖs right, we have to handle this by ourselves.
 Right, Tonton?
 Do you think itΓÇÖs going to work out well?
 No problem.
 Here she comes.
 Old Lady Tsunade!
 Stop!
 You know who we are, right?
 YouΓÇÖre the henchmen of the Akagi.
 Then I'll make it brief.
 Pay back your debt in one lump sum.
 Or elseΓÇª
 his life is over!
 Help me!
 Whatever. His life doesnΓÇÖt matter much to me.
 ΓÇô Huh! ΓÇô What did you just say?!
 Well then, the moneyΓÇª
 Why did it come to this?
 This isnΓÇÖt titillating, this is just tight!
 Drats! Let me have patience!
 DidnΓÇÖt you hear me?
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter to me what happens with his life.
 YouΓÇª darn old hag!
 Was what I would have said, until just a little bit ago, I think.
 Once I become the Hokage, heΓÇÖd be a precious subordinate.
 I canΓÇÖt leave him in the mess.
 Old Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Right now, this is all IΓÇÖve got. Take it.
 Let me make sure of this.
 I donΓÇÖt mean itΓÇÖs paid off in full, but thatΓÇÖll do it for the interest, right?
 Fake!
 YouΓÇÖre not going to pay the money back?
 It's none of your business.
 These guys canΓÇÖt go home! DonΓÇÖt you feel sorry for them!
 You couldnΓÇÖt possibly?
 In that case, IΓÇÖll have to use force to get it back!
 NarutoΓÇÖs Shadow Clones?!
 I see, Naruto has joined hands with the Akagi FamilyΓÇª
 So, where did Naruto and company go?
 As expectedΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt think sheΓÇÖd hand the money over meekly.
 But to be that much of a cowardΓÇª
 What should we do?
 Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase.
 No doubt thereΓÇÖs money in it.
 We have to do something to get our hands on that suitcase.
 Shoot!
 I'm supposed to be kidnapped, and sheΓÇÖs casually drinking sake.
 ItΓÇÖs that suitcase.
 How do we get it out?
 Leave it to me.
 Lady Tsunade, youΓÇÖve returned.
 Ah, hereΓÇÖs the suitcase.
 ItΓÇÖs dangerous, so letΓÇÖs leave it at the front desk.
 Well thenΓÇª
 Look, I went and got it!
 ΓÇô You did it! 					ΓÇô You did it!
 Old Lady Tsunade!
 ShootΓÇª If youΓÇÖre the HokageΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre the Hokage,
 then pay your debt back like a Hokage would!
 A Hokage is meant to protect everyone!
 These guys canΓÇÖt return their home, they are desperate!
 Why donΓÇÖt you do something?!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Or do people from other countries not matter to you?
 That kind of HokageΓÇª I cannot accept!
 Now!
 Here!
 Hurry up and run away!
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Okay!
 Oh, sheΓÇÖs already catching up!
 ItΓÇÖs all or nothing!
 Huh?
 ΓÇô You did it! 					ΓÇô You did it!
 Tonton?!
 Naruto!
 Just hand over the suitcase! Or else!
 F-Fork over the suitcase!
 If we take a direct hit from Old Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs attack,
 then itΓÇÖs over!
 Out of the way, out of the way!
 Purse snatchers?
 Excuse us!
 Hey whatΓÇÖs going on?!
 Hey! DonΓÇÖt cause trouble for the general public!
 ItΓÇÖs because youΓÇÖre following us!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 WhatΓÇÖs going onΓÇª?
 Naruto, we leave it up to you.
 This is no good.
 If the contents of that suitcase become known,
 it will be a disasterΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right, that happened too.
 And I was young then too.
 Gulp it down.
 Excuse me, Boss.
 What is it? YouΓÇÖre in front of a guest.
 W-WellΓÇª
 A clone!
 ThatΓÇÖs a clone too?
 Wrong again.
 Sheesh, which is the real one?!
 The restΓÇª
 ΓÇô Where are the rest?! ΓÇô Where are the rest?!
 Over there!
 ΓÇô Hold it! 					ΓÇô Hold it!
 ΓÇô Naruto! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 ΓÇô Wait! 					ΓÇô Wait!
 ΓÇô Naruto! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 Prepare yourself!
 Shoot, let me go! Let me go!
 Settle down!
 G-Got it!
 The money!
 Okay, they got it!
 IOUΓÇÖs?!
 ItΓÇÖs not money?!
 ΓÇô Oh noΓÇª ΓÇô This is too much!
 What are you doing?! This is in the middle of town!
 Huh!
 T-Two Old Ladies?!
 YouΓÇÖre mixed up in this commotion as well?
 IΓÇÖd like to hear your reason for it, Shizune!
 HelloΓÇª Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 What?! ShizuneΓÇª
 And you guys belong to the Akagi.
 B-Boss Jirocho!
 Who?
 You donΓÇÖt know?!
 HeΓÇÖs the number one gang boss, Jirocho from the Land of Tea!
 HeΓÇÖs an old friend of mine.
 As luck would have it, we met by accident on the street.
 YouΓÇÖre Bunzo and Senta if IΓÇÖm not mistaken.
 Just in time. I have something to say to you!
 ΓÇô What?! 					 ΓÇô What?!
 You mean the debt to the Akagi Family?
 I paid it back a year ago.
 Is that true?
 That was last year, when we were near AkagiΓÇÖs.
 Did you forget?
 I-IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Hey!
 ItΓÇÖs a circular from Akagi addressed to me.
 IΓÇÖll just read the part addressed to you.
 ΓÇ£Senta and Bunzo,
 ΓÇ£The debt is paid, come home soon.ΓÇ¥ Signed, Shugoro Akagi.
 See?
 You've gotta be kidding.
 All that energy spent, for nothing.
 ΓÇô Thank you for helping us. ΓÇô Thank you for helping us.
 ΓÇô Now we can go home relieved. ΓÇô Now we can go home relieved.
 Go in good spirits.
 ΓÇô You too, Naruto. Take care! ΓÇô You too, Naruto. Take care!
 Hey, if the suitcase doesnΓÇÖt have money in it,
 why were you so serious about getting it back?
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 If the IOUΓÇÖs were discovered by the people in the village,
 theyΓÇÖll oppose Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs installment as Hokage.
 You worry too much.
 The Hokage and the debt are unrelated.
 Not only that, she said she returned the money,
 so thereΓÇÖs nothing to worry about.
 At least the Akagi debt wasΓÇª
 What?
 DonΓÇÖt worry, donΓÇÖt worry!
 What? We forgot something?
 Finally, the time has come.
 Communal bathing with girlsΓÇª
 Patience paid offΓÇª
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 You're awesome, Old Lady Tsunade!
 Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke are all right now!
 You can't rejoice yet.
 The current situation in the village is serious.
 You're right. I have to do my best,
 And work hard for the village as well.
 Hey! N-Naruto, where do you think you're going?!
 I have to fill my stomach first!
 You have no sense of emergencyΓÇª

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 Special technique!
 Shadow  Clone Jutsu, fishing version!
 Thrash about more!
 I want to catch some for curing!
 Three isn't enough!
 Three more, you loser!
 This is very taxing, you know?!
 I mean, let's switch!
 Sasuke!
 The fire's ready to light! Fireballs please.
 I guess three is okay for the time beingΓÇª
 Wha--?
 Hey, wait a minute!
 The Scroll's Secret: No Peeking Allowed
 It's already been four days since the second exam started.
 Yeah.
 That's right.
 The start of the second exam was around three in the afternoon.
 We only have twenty-five or twenty-six hours left.
 There may already be some teams that have passed.
 That meansΓÇª
 I wonder if it'll be broiled soon.
 We're soon going to be in a hot spotΓÇª
 That's the biggest one.
 Believe it!
 OkayΓÇª
 Even if we were to try pursuit,
 there's probably hardly anybody left to become targets.
 What do we do?
 Almost everyone's surely already passed.
 Yeah.  It's already been four days, after all.
 AnywayΓÇª
 It's early afternoon nowΓÇª
 Let's have a meal.
 You two rest a bit and I'll go find us something to eat.
 SayΓÇª
 Hmm?
 As I recall, on the other oneΓÇª
 ""Heaven"" was written hereΓÇª
 and unlike this, both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?
 Umm, when I was shown the scroll before the exam,
 I wasn't really looking.
 So, what of it all of a sudden?
 Y-You've got to be kiddingΓÇª?
 For all we knowΓÇª
 there may not be any Heaven scrolls.
 What do you mean, Sakura?
 Well, in this second examΓÇª
 four of the five-day time limit have passed already.
 So that means we've already used eighty percent of the total exam time.
 Seventy-eight participants and twenty-six teams.
 There are only thirteen each of the Heaven and Earth scrolls.
 At most there are only thirteen passing teams.
 Moreover, you remember, donΓÇÖt you, Sasuke?
 That the Orochimaru guy burned  the ΓÇ£Heaven scrollΓÇ¥ that we had.
 Which meansΓÇª
 The teams that will pass had already, at that point, decreased by one.
 Hmm?
 Also, all of the other scrolls are not necessarily safe, soΓÇª
 After parting ways with the Leaf Village bunch,
 we allotted two days for healingΓÇª
 So from here on, we have to increase the distance of our actions.
 At any rate, the next enemy is our last chance.
 I'm going to get some drinking water.
 Say! Say!
 I have a good way for us not to fight with an enemy. Believe it!
 What?!
 Get serious!
 I am serious.
 I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.
 Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual, for notesΓÇª.
 If we tweak this a little and change it into exactly like the Heaven scrollΓÇª
 H-Hold it!
 Huh?
 Even if you did such a thing, you don't know what's written on the inside!
 If the Proctor looked inside you will be discovered right away!
 Idiot!
 Generally with things like this,
 there's a password or something written
 and you canΓÇÖt get it unless you have both scrolls.
 In other wordsΓÇª
 to pass at the tower goal, we'll surely need a password.
 Or something like that. Believe it!
 What difference does it make?
 If you don't know the content, there's no use making a fake!
 Man, here I was wondering what you were going to say, looking all bigΓÇª
 You're an idiot who just can't think through things.
 B-ButΓÇª
 What if we could predict the contentΓÇª?
 This Earth scrollΓÇª
 You wouldn'tΓÇª
 I'm going toΓÇªopen this scroll!
 No!
 You! Have you forgotten even the rules, you idiot?
 We were told not to look inside the scrolls until arriving at the tower, right?
 But, at this rate, weΓÇÖll be in a hot spot, right?
 There might be a trap or something.
 CarefullyΓÇª Be careful.
 Yeah.
 I knowΓÇª
 Hey, what's wrong?
 Hey!
 What's wrong?
 What happened?!
 Hey!
 Hey! 					Answer me!
 You'd best not do it.
 An enemy?
 Man, you're beyond savingΓÇª
 That was close.
 W-We're sorry.
 Those who ignored the rules are forced into the situation of having to retire.
 In the previous exam, hypnotism Jutsu Formula was set up to
 get into the eyes of those who looked at the scroll along the way.
 A measure to get them to lie in the forest until the end of the exam.
 By the wayΓÇª
 If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?
 What're you doing hanging around here alone?
 It's not that I'm after your scroll.
 I didn't think so.
 If that was your intentionΓÇª you could've taken it from Naruto just now.
 So you're also after the Heaven scroll?
 No.
 I already have them both.
 See?
 What?
 Things led to thingsΓÇª
 I was hurrying over to the vicinity of the tower
 to wait for my estranged companions.
 Now, if you'll excuse meΓÇª
 Wait!
 Fight me.
 Lucky!
 Fight you, you say?
 S-Sasuke.
 This idiot-suke.
 What are you saying suddenly?
 Are you serious?
 Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.
 Hey, Sasuke! Kabuto saved us!
 Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.
 Shut up!
 SasuΓÇªke.
 It can't be helped. I said it before, too.
 This is all that can be done to survive through this forest now.
 HmmΓÇªThat's a lie.
 A lie?
 Your heart isn't totally in this as much as you're saying.
 If you could really become serious about this examΓÇª
 Why is it necessary to fight me?
 You should jump on me at my unguarded moment,
 without going to the trouble of announcing it.
 That'sΓÇªa Ninja.
 Hmm, that's profound.
 I don't dislike that side of you.
 So I shall tell you the way you should go.
 HoweverΓÇªlet's talk as we move.
 The smell of broiled fish in the fire smoke had reached a great distance.
 At this rate, we'll be marked by fierce animalsΓÇªand enemies.
 Humph!
 Are there really still enemies around?
 Yes, no mistake.
 If you think about it a little, you'll understand.
 Do you know the cleverest way of fighting in battles
 in jungles and expansive forests such as this?
 No.
 The tower located in the center of this forest,
 the common goal for us test-takers.
 That means when the last day of the test is hereΓÇª
 the area near that tower is the easiest place to gather scrolls.
 Oh, I see. 					Ambush, right?
 In other words, we go after the scrolls of the teams
 that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls and are setting out for the tower.
 That's one-third of the answer.
 What?
 I mean that you guys are not the only ones thinking that!
 Near the tower, the same badgers have probably already set traps, soΓÇª
 I see!
 That means there are lots of enemies lying in wait to engage us.
 Heh, having a handicap gets me pumped, I say!
 I'm looking forward to it!
 If we just beat them all and get the Heaven scroll,
 we'll all survive the second exam!
 No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!
 What's the remaining one-third of the answer?
 The collectors who are certain to appear during an exam of this nature.
 Collectors?
 In this exam, with the tower just a stone's throw away,
 you definitely can't rest easyΓÇª
 Those particular conditions are what create them.
 In other words, those who gather extra scrollsΓÇª
 as compensation for sparing them when coming across an unexpected enemy.
 Also, those who get information to proceed favorably through later exams
 by providing the lacking scrolls to comrades sharing the same village.
 And those who are thinking of, under conditions favorable to them,
 annihilating the powerful ones who will probably get through to the third exam.
 It goes without saying, but these guys are quite the big guns
 and the worst enemies who are definitely not conceited.
 I see.
 I understand the reason why you appeared before us.
 You're scared, too, right?
 That's right.
 Now then, the tower has finally come into view.
 From here on is the hard part.
 All right, let's go!
 An enemy already?
 There!
 Oh, it's just a centipede.
 Yikes! It's huge.
 All those legs are gross.
 Naruto.
 Huh?
 I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds and careless actions from here on.
 Huh?
 Rushing ahead through a dense forest making noise like an elephant
 is the same as serving notice in a loud voice that we're coming.
 We'd definitely receive an enthusiastic welcome.
 O-Oh, I see.
 As long as time allows, we should go slowly while remaining hidden.
 ΓÇô Yeah. 					ΓÇô Okay.
 Sure.
 Heh, not bad, everyone.
 Oh?
 Okay, it's this way.
 Is it a trap?
 Yeah.  It'll get intense ahead from here on.
 Kabuto!
 H-Huh?
 That was close, Naruto.
 Substitution Jutsu!
 I told you, it would get intense ahead from here on.
 I'veΓÇªhad itΓÇª
 Oh! Sakura!
 For crying out loud, how far have we walked?
 The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.
 Here we can see it right in front of our eyes.
 StrangeΓÇª
 No mistake about it.
 It seems that we're already within the enthusiastic welcome.
 Take a look at that.
 Oh, that can't be!
 What on earth is going on?
 No way!
 Is it GenjutsuΓÇª?
 So it seems.
 We were lured in perfectly.
 It appears we were meticulously careful,
 and were made to walk around the same place in a circle.
 We're being watchedΓÇª
 Probably.
 They intend to wear down our physical strength and
 catch us unprepared when we're bone-tired.
 If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
 Then... they'll be coming soon.
 TheyΓÇÖve appeared.
 Hah!
 This is the perfect handicap.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's with these guys?
 Crawling out all of a sudden?
 Fighting in numbers isn't necessarily a good thing, you know?
 Since it's come to this,
 it'll be a comparison of the number of Clone Jutsu.
 I can get twice of twice of twice of twice of your...
 Anyway, I'll multiply to an incredible number!
 It doesn't matter if it's your Genjutsu or whatever.
 I'll kick all their butts!

 No, it may be more than equal!
 Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu to Transform Jutsu, thatΓÇÖs a clever trick.
 Naruto shouldnΓÇÖt be able to do thatΓÇª
 His timing at using JutsuΓÇÖs is very good.
 What? HeΓÇÖs better than I thought.
 But, to get mad like that after biting the opponent himselfΓÇª
 What a funny guy.

 ThatΓÇÖs amazing, Naruto!

 Evidently itΓÇÖs no longer ΓÇ£thatΓÇ¥ Naruto.
 Yeah.
 I wonder, what kind of trick Kakashi usedΓÇª?

 it's probably more than Naruto.

 You, thatΓÇÖs all you say!
 What?!
 What did that guy eat?
 ItΓÇÖs Food Pills.
 F-Food Pills?
 Food Pills are a secret medicine that people in the military take

 Hey, thatΓÇÖs the kidΓÇª
 I heard heΓÇÖs the only one... who failed.
 Humph! Serves him right!
 ItΓÇÖs trouble if a kid like that becomes a Ninja.
 After all, that kid is reallyΓÇª
 Stop! Anything further is taboo.
 Nobody tried to acknowledge real Naruto.
 Clone Jutsu!
 But nowΓÇª
 EveryoneΓÇÖs watchingΓÇª
 Stand up! Naruto!
 Everyone is acknowledging him!
 If you compete with me for the name of HokageΓÇª
 YouΓÇªwill be the loser!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 That Kiba, he sure is stupid.
 Think hard about your Jutsu when you use them.
 Otherwise, your opponents will take advantage of the Jutsu.
 Well, the outcome of you and me could be seen from the beginning.
 The way youΓÇÖve torn me apart up until now,
 IΓÇÖll give it back all at once!

163,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Is this really MosoΓÇÖs house?
 Here heΓÇÖs a superintendant officer,
 so I thought itΓÇÖd be a more luxurious building with gold folding screens.
 Your voices are too loud.
 Lord Moso is a magnificent person with no self-interests.
 So he lives frugally.
 But you know, heΓÇÖs an old man
 whoΓÇÖs the second most important guy in the land next to the feudal lord, right?
 He smacks of being really poor.
 Naruto!
 Well well, how shameful of me to present such a poor residence.
 Lord Moso.
 What?!
 This old man like from some dumpling shop?
 IΓÇÖm an old man from a dumpling shop?
 Geez, unbelievable!
 Idiot!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Neji?!
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 So you are Ninja who came from the Village Hidden in Leaves?
 From the right, this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.
 I hear you encountered the Cursed Warrior that appeared
 in Lord KomeiΓÇÖs residence last night.
 Yes.
 So, how did it go?
 Did you figure out the true identity of the Cursed Warrior?
 Yeah, itΓÇÖs a real ghost.
 Oh, a ghost, huh?
 DonΓÇÖt be jumping to conclusions on your own.
 But he appears all of a sudden and flies around.
 Yeah, and on top of that, the inside of his armor was empty.
 No matter how bizarre the thing, thereΓÇÖs always a trick.
 IΓÇÖll pin down the true identity without fail.
 That is encouragingΓÇª
 We have just changed feudal lords and the public is still anxious.
 Please eliminate the rumors of the Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.
 I beg of you.
 Please!
 Tsurucho Yakitori
 Here are your chicken wings.
 Oh, here we go!
 They look tasty!
 Hot!
 That Moso superintendant officer seems like a good guy.
 Yes. It was also Lord Moso who came to my rescue
 and selected me to be a page.
 The son of the feudal lord succeeds him
 and an excellent superintendant officer offers him tutelageΓÇª
 The government appears to be stable, butΓÇª
 Then why is there a strange rumor going around
 about the haunting of the previous feudal lord?
 ThereΓÇÖs probably somebody displeased
 with this dramatic replacement of the feudal lord.
 Do you have any idea who it might be?
 Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.
 Isn't that the name of the tactician you were talking about
 who wanted to become the feudal lord?
 Then why did the Cursed Warrior appear in his residence?
 Perhaps to deflect attention.
 ThatΓÇÖs it. 					I bet thatΓÇÖs it.
 All right, since itΓÇÖs come to this,
 if we can nab that old man called Komei or whatever
 and quickly get him to own upΓÇª
 Guys, letΓÇÖs get fired up and get going!
 Idiot. We canΓÇÖt do something like that without proof.
 He is a tactician of this land more or less, so.
 Oh man, thatΓÇÖs no fun.
 First, I want to meet Lord Sagi, the feudal lord.
 ThatΓÇÖs not possible. Lord Sagi does not like to meet anybody.
 DonΓÇÖt be such a stick-in-the-mud. Let us meet him, okay?
 YouΓÇÖre a ΓÇ£nippleΓÇ¥ friend, right?
 If youΓÇÖre going to say that, say, ΓÇ£childhood friend.ΓÇ¥
 Huh?
 Can we really meet him in a place like this?
 This lake holds fond memories for Lord Sagi.
 AndΓÇªfor me as well.
 In our young days,
 Lord Sagi always played with his little sister Lady Toki here.
 He might come here around about today with his attendantsΓÇª
 If weΓÇÖre lucky.
 ItΓÇÖs up to luck, huh?
 ItΓÇÖs Lord Sagi.
 Lord Sagi, we have arrived.
 Thank you.
 Oh wowΓÇª So thatΓÇÖs Lord Sagi, huh?
 HeΓÇÖs cute. He is kind of my likingΓÇª
 My watch has remained stopped since that time.
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs he doing?
 HeΓÇÖs probably reminiscing.
 The only thing that can comfort Lord SagiΓÇÖs heart
 is his memories with Lady Toki.
 Byakugan.
 Where is it?
 WhereΓÇÖs this bloodthirsty aura coming from?
 ItΓÇÖs not above ground?
 Could it be, underwaterΓÇª?
 Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!
 I donΓÇÖt think so!
 Who the heck are you guys?
 Damn it! I wonΓÇÖt let you get away.
 Wait, Naruto!
 What is it?
 A letter bomb in the water.
 That was a close one.
 If youΓÇÖd chased after them as is, you wouldΓÇÖve been totally entangled.
 Settle down.
 Lord Sagi!
 Are you all right?!
 Yes, IΓÇÖm fine.
 Thank goodness!
 Lord Sagi, these three are Ninja from the Village Hidden in LeavesΓÇª
 They came to investigate the true identity of the Cursed Warrior.
 That was unnecessary. I bet it was that  MosoΓÇÖs idea?
 It was all because he was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.
 The fact is, if these people were not here nowΓÇª
 Silence.
 Y-Yes, my lord.
 Hey-hey, do you really not get how this guy feels?!
 Chishima was seriously worried about you.
 Without his passionate friendship,
 the Hidden Leaf Village wouldnΓÇÖt have taken action with that low commission fee.
 I am not obliged.
 How bothersome!
 Say what?!
 Friendship is in the past.
 I became a feudal lord and he is a mere page.
 We are now standing on different surfaces.
 Say that again! IΓÇÖll slug the guy who tramples on friendship--!
 Let it go, Naruto.
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?! Let go of me!
 I have to give guys like this a good thumping!
 You are talking about a feudal lord!
 It would have been better had it pierced my throat.
 Go.
 Yes, my lord.
 Jeez, who does he think he is?!
 Jeez, a feudal lord.
 Please forgive him.
 What? You donΓÇÖt have a problem with being told off like that?!
 He wasnΓÇÖt like that in the old days.
 His father and little sister died in succession
 and he became cold-hearted.
 So thatΓÇÖs what it was.
 IΓÇÖm sure the day will come
 when he will turn back into the kind-hearted Lord Sagi.
 I donΓÇÖt know about that.
 The Shuriken from before.
 This is an odd shape.
 Hm? Let me have a look.
 Oh!
 Does it look familiar to you or something?
 Y-Yes. There are no Ninja in the Land of Birds.
 But there are guardsmen receiving special training.
 Is it a weapon those people use?
 Yes.
 Who commands those guardsmen?
 The person who organizes them is Lord Komei the tactician.
 Say what?!
 Komei again.
 Komei must have originally thought to mislead the public with the Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to create a rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.
 But the relationship between the two is tight.
 And by Moso summoning us here, he probably sensed that the day
 was approaching when the truth behind the incident would be revealed
 and he plotted to assassinate Lord Sagi.
 If weΓÇÖve figured out that much, letΓÇÖs charge on in--!
 Hold your horses, Naruto.
 We have to find more hard evidence.
 Hey, is that how it is?
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖs how it is.
 Neji, look at that.
 No doubt, itΓÇÖs Komei!
 To think heΓÇÖd go out without attendants
 even though the Cursed Warrior might appear.
 All right, letΓÇÖs follow him.
 This is the temple where the Cursed Warrior appeared last night.
 Something smells fishy.
 HeΓÇÖs shown upΓÇª!
 Byakugan.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to waver anymore!
 Hey! Wait.
 IΓÇÖve witnessed the true identity of the ghost!
 WhoΓÇÖs there?
 Hey hey, Komei!
 YouΓÇÖre the one responsible for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 What?
 H-Hold it!
 Naruto, get down!
 I did it!
 Damn it! No good.
 This thingΓÇÖs not just a ghost, after all.
 A tornado?
 I canΓÇÖt see the Cursed Warrior!
 Byakugan.
 A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!
 8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!
 WhatΓÇÖre you letting your mind drift for?!
 SorryΓÇª I never thought a ghost could use Ninjutsu.
 ItΓÇÖs not a ghost inside the armor. ltΓÇÖs a Shinobi.
 And quite a wily one at that.
 This is the same shape as the shuriken from this afternoon.
 HeΓÇÖs an important witness. Take him alive.
 Leave it to me!
 But we canΓÇÖt take him alive
 if we donΓÇÖt do something about that tornado.
 Naruto.
 IΓÇÖm counting on you!
 Right. IΓÇÖll try!
 Tenten, use as many weapons as possible and draw his attention.
 Roger.
 No good. No effect at all.
 ThatΓÇÖs fine. Just keep at it.
 NejiΓÇªnow!
 Gentle Fist Technique, 8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms.
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms.
 All right, we did it!
 WeΓÇÖll find out the true identity for sure this time.
 Show us your real face.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 ItΓÇÖs empty again.
 This canΓÇÖt be!
 Lord Komei, we have seized from a storeroom in your residence,
 one suit of white armor along with guardsmen Shuriken.
 We would like you to report to the magistrateΓÇÖs office
 as a material witness in the recent Cursed Warrior incident
 as well as the attempted assassination of Lord Sagi.
 I have no choice.
 Thank you very much.
 With this, Lord SagiΓÇÖs heart should settle down somewhat.
 Case closed.
 Still, they were sure prepared.
 Here an hour has barely passed since contacting Moso.
 At that timeΓÇª
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 There was a human presence in tonightΓÇÖs Cursed Warrior.
 The presence of someone alive.
 A presence?
 But you said you didnΓÇÖt feel such a presence in the first Cursed Warrior.
 Yeah.
 Hey, what does that mean?
 In other words, the two Cursed Warrior are separate beings.
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 How can we go back to the village when there's all this mystery?
 If we're gonna investigate, this has to be it.
 What? Could this black thing beΓÇª?
 I get it! We use this to get through the darkΓÇª
 Hey, why did we end up in a place like this?!

 Sakura!
 It was worth teaching you Genjutsu in survival training
 during the Genin Exam.
 You truly have a talent for it.
 Huh?
 Release the Genjutsu and wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Naruto will be delighted.
 HeΓÇÖll be getting a mission after such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be carefulΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the first A-Ranked mission since the Land of the Waves.
 Village in Distress: A New A-Ranked Mission!
 Sensei! What do you mean by A-Ranked mission in the condition we are in?!
 What do we have to do?!
 Sasuke is chasing Gaara and company of the Sand Village.
 SakuraΓÇª
 Release the Genjutsu on Naruto and Shikamaru,
 and go after Sasuke.
 I feel uneasyΓÇª about that unusual Chakra.
 But then,
 we should wake up Ino and Choji and go in a large group.
 There may already be quite a large number
 of Sand and Sound Shinobi who have infiltrated this village.
 Actions lose quickness when thereΓÇÖs more than the fundamental four in a squadΓÇª
 and it becomes difficult to hide from the enemy.
 You learned that in the Academy's patrol practical training, right?
 Oh, I see! Then four means that youΓÇÖll come with usΓÇª
 No, I must not leave here.

 As for the rest, this Pakkun will track down Sasuke by scent!

 Now, IΓÇÖll announce the mission!
 As soon as youΓÇÖve heard what the mission is, go through that hole.

 I must get rid this corpse because it contains many secrets.
 Now then, please excuse me.
 However, this boy, Haku...
 was Zabuza's comrade.
 Will you be all right the next time?
 The next timeΓÇª
 I'll be able to see right through the Sharingan.
 Kakashi who has inferred that Zabuza is still alive,
 gives Naruto and gangΓÇª
 ΓÇô Ready!! ΓÇô new training in preparation... 96	01:07:15:05	01:07:17:23 ΓÇô Here I go! 		ΓÇô for Zabuza's second assault.
 And then, 					One week later...
 This mistΓÇª
 Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming!
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 The time has come!
 Secret JutsuΓÇª
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 Now thenΓÇª I'll start.
 Take this!
 Naruto UzumakiΓÇª
 is finally here!!
 The Number One Hyperactive, Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!
 Now that I've come, you're all right!
 OhΓÇª
 Naruto!
 The hero of a story generally appears in this kind of situation
 and takes out the enemy in no time!
 HehΓÇª That brat, ehΓÇª
 He's long on talk...
 Man, that idiot!
 Making such a conspicuous entranceΓÇª
 There's no point if you don't catch the enemy off guard!
 That boyΓÇª
 What're you doing in a place like this from morning?
 Training!!
 Why are you training?
 I want to get stronger!
 All right, here I go! Shadow Clone JutsuΓÇª
 Huh?!
 Oh, no!
 Huh?
 Get out of the way, Naruto!
 Whoa!
 What?!
 He's savedΓÇª
 To think the enemy attacks would cancel each other outΓÇª
 That was super luckyΓÇª
 Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!
 Hey! What kind of idiot would attempt
 to cast a Jutsu directly in front of an opponent?!
 What?!
 The essence of a Ninja is deception. How you deceive your opponent.
 Even casting one Jutsu, you avoid the eyes of your opponents,
 catch them off balance, and outsmart themΓÇª
 The way you made your entrance earlier, that's just you coming to be a targetΓÇª
 N-Nooo.
 But I went to the trouble of coming to the rescue.
 What concerns me more than that isΓÇª
 That guyΓÇª
 HakuΓÇª What's the idea?
 Zabuza, leave this kid to meΓÇª
 Please let me fight this battle my way.
 What did you sayΓÇª?
 So you mean no interferingΓÇªHaku?
 You're naiveΓÇªas usualΓÇª
 I'm sorryΓÇª
 Naive, ehΓÇª
 True enoughΓÇª
 Judging from these wounds,
 there's no mistaking that I was attacked with a Senbon.
 But no vital areas have been targeted so far.
 Does he mean to half-kill meΓÇª?
 If so!
 As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!
 It's impossible. lt's too much for Naruto!
 I should be the one toΓÇª
 Hey. Don't get any ideasΓÇª
 If you move,
 you know what'll happen to that old man, right?
 TrueΓÇª
 If I move away from here and head towards Naruto,
 Zabuza will kill Tazuna.
 No way can Sakura completely protect him by herself.
 How about it?
 Let's just see how those young guys fight against each other.
 That maskΓÇª
 You were Zabuza's comrade, after all, weren't you!
 You've got nerve to deceive us!
 I'm sorry.
 But, your teacher also said it, didn't he?
 Things like deceiving and catching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.
 Please don't take it personally.
 You don't have that luxury, either!
 Huh?
 Sasuke?
 I haven'tΓÇªforgotten about you.
 Here I thought he had disappearedΓÇª but he was thereΓÇª
 I would rather you had just gone down quietly.
 But it looks like it won't work that way.
 Fine. I'll put an end to it first.
 H-Hey!
 Naruto. I'll get to you later.
 W-What's with himΓÇª?
 This is it!
 So the real body is over there, ehΓÇª
 Okay!
 I'm over here.
 He movedΓÇª? How?!
 ΓÇô Sasuke! 					ΓÇô Sasuke!
 What was that just now?!
 Sasuke's body suddenly got batteredΓÇª
 How's he doing it?!
 What kind of Jutsu is he usingΓÇª?
 It's conceivable that he has clones hide in the mirrors and
 gets them all to throw the Senbons simultaneouslyΓÇª
 No, they're too fast consideringΓÇª
 What does it mean...
 not being able to see even the trajectory of the weaponsΓÇª?
 Also, if it's a mere Clone JutsuΓÇª
 I don't see a reason for these ice mirrorsΓÇª
 In any case, there's no way to question that these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.
 What I can do is to launch attacksΓÇª
 from both the outside and inside.
 The thing to do is to figure out the meaning of the mirror!
 I'll take care of here!
 All there is to do isΓÇª
 for me to attack the inside and have Naruto try attacking the mirrors from the outside.
 Yo! I came to save you.
 You okay, Sasuke?
 OhΓÇª
 What good will it do you to catch your ally off guardΓÇª?
 Y-You idiot!
 If you're a Shinobi, you'll move more cautiously!
 What's with you?!
 I came to the rescue, you know!
 If you also come inside the mirrorsΓÇª
 Dang it! I've had it, you fool!
 Fool? What do you mean by fool?!
 As to be expected of the number one unpredictable Ninja.
 He is making the situation worse and worse by coming to aid.
 Since it's come to this, all that is left is to smash the mirrors!
 Fire Style!
 Hey! What're you going to do?!
 These are mirrors made with freezing waterΓÇª
 If soΓÇª
 Fireball Jutsu!
 It's not working at all!
 They won't melt with that level of firepower.
 Darn it! Where'd he attack from?! ls it the clones?
 Where's the real body?!
 It's useless for you to even attempt following with your eyes.
 I absolutely will not be caught.
 Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't!
 If so, I'll find out which is the real body by hitting them all!
 This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses mirrors that can reflect only my image.
 Watching you from the speed I move,
 it almost seems as if you aren't moving at allΓÇª
 I knew it!
 Is that JutsuΓÇªthe Kekkei Genkai?!
 KekkeiΓÇªGenkaiΓÇª?
 It's the same type as my SharinganΓÇª
 Deep blood tiesΓÇª Lineage of paranormal individualsΓÇª
 A type of Jutsu that is passed on only through those traitsΓÇª
 ThenΓÇª!
 That's rightΓÇª
 It's impossible even for me to copy that JutsuΓÇª
 And there's no way to destroy that Jutsu, either!
 Darn itΓÇª
 SoΓÇªwhat?!
 I can't die here yet.
 'Cause I have a dream that I must turn into realityΓÇª
 The dream to have my strength recognized by everyone in the villageΓÇª
 and become the Hokage!
 DreamΓÇª
 Pathetic brat.
 Brats like you aren't needed by anyone
 and die without ever knowing any freedom or dreamsΓÇª
 You have the same eyes as I doΓÇª
 For me, becoming a Shinobi completely is difficult.
 If I can, I don't want to kill you guysΓÇª
 And I don't want to get killed by you guysΓÇª
 But if you guys are going to come at meΓÇª
 I'll kill my feelings with a sword and completely become a Shinobi.
 This bridge is the battleground that connects each of us to our dreams.
 I, for the sake of my dream.
 And you, for the sake of your dreams.
 Please don't hold it against meΓÇª
 I want to protect the person dear to meΓÇª
 I work for the sake of that person, I fight for that person,
 and I want to make that person's dream a realityΓÇª
 That's my dream.
 For the sake of the dream, I will completely become a Shinobi...
 and kill you guys!
 Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!
 Cuz' I've finally discovered the way to break through it!
 Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.
 Let's pull out of this place and go assist Kakashi Sensei.
 I've had this bad feeling from a while ago.
 Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehow until we get there.
 Next episode:  ""Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters.""

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 Umm, whereΓÇÖs the room that SasukeΓÇÖs in?
 Mr. Sasuke is not allowed any visitors.
 What?! Hey, hey! What's up with that?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry, those are the rules.
 Why, Sis, tell me why?
 Naruto, this is a hospital. Keep it down.
 Say! Say! I've got a favor to ask!
 You donΓÇÖt need to say it all.
 Well, I thought it would come to this soΓÇª
 I searched for someone to watch your training.
 Why?!
 I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
 I have some matters to take care of.
 I donΓÇÖt have time to trouble myself with you.
 Oh! Aha...!
 YouΓÇÖre going to train Sasuke, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 Well... don't say that.
 I found a sensei whoΓÇÖs more reliable than I am!
 WellΓÇªwho is it?
 ItΓÇÖs me!
 Huh?!
 Oh!
 You!
 The Closet Perv!
 Such insolence!
 Ebisu Returns: Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!
 Ebisu Sensei is a Closet Perv?
 WhyΓÇÖs this guy my training teacher?!
 In the first place, heΓÇÖs weaker than me!
 What did you say?
 But you see! But you see!
 A long time ago, with my Harem Jutsu, this guyΓÇª
 Transform!
 Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!
 B-By any chanceΓÇª
 Harem Jutsu?
 U-UhΓÇªitΓÇÖs nothing!
 IΓÇÖll treat you to and buy you whatever you want later!
 Just be quiet about that!
 You better.
 Wow, I didnΓÇÖt know you were acquainted.
 Well, theyΓÇÖre unsavory ties, but.
 How could I ever forget that humiliation?
 But why this guy?
 I definitely donΓÇÖt want him to.
 Same here.
 If it werenΓÇÖt KakashiΓÇÖs favor, whoΓÇÖd teach you for the fun of it?
 Then donΓÇÖt.
 Now now, both of youΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt say that.
 Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor
 who teaches the elite, a special Jonin!
 HeΓÇÖs truly better at teaching than I am.
 Well, Naruto, of the three kids in Squad Seven that I taught,
 youΓÇÖre the worst at the basic skills.
 Get taught with care this time around.
 How the heck am I inferior compared to Sakura and Sasuke?!
 Naruto, itΓÇÖs fact that you donΓÇÖt have the fundamentals down.
 No matter what you do, the basic skills are important.
 If you really want to become strong, just be quiet and listen to what I say.
 Now then, Ebisu Sensei, IΓÇÖm leaving him with you.
 Yes, yes.
 Dang it.
 It may appear to be harsh,
 but you can become stronger a lot more.
 Do your best.
 Okay, then, letΓÇÖs go.
 Still, IΓÇÖm not convincedΓÇª
 Huh?
 You see!
 Fundamentals might be important,
 but I wonΓÇÖt get strong being taught by someone weaker than me!
 So in other words, you want to say that IΓÇÖm weak?
 Who else is here?!
 I was certainly surprised having that indecent Jutsu used on me that time.
 But itΓÇÖs premature for you to judge my ability on just that.
 Even though you were totally knocked out.
 Fine.
 Then, why donΓÇÖt we put it to the test?
 Hmm?
 Naruto, run.
 Huh?
 If you can get to outrun me, IΓÇÖll back down quietly.
 Back downΓÇª?
 Yes.
 And of course, IΓÇÖll speak to Kakashi Sensei
 about you receiving direct training.
 What?! Really?!
 This elite instructor does not go back on his word.
 However, this is only if you can outrun me.
 Then that makes it easy!
 See ya!
 ThisΓÇÖll be a snap, a snap!
 IΓÇÖll lose thatΓÇª Closet Perv in no time!
 He already canΓÇÖt catch up!
 I knew I was quite an exceptional NinjaΓÇª
 Who is exceptional, you say?
 Surely youΓÇÖre not thinking you can outrun me with just that much.
 W-WhatΓÇÖre you saying?!
 The chase has stillΓÇª
 only just begun!
 Though heΓÇÖs a Closet Perv,
 heΓÇÖs the elite tutor after all, heΓÇÖs good.
 Now then.
 I knew you were Closet Perv.
 What are you doingΓÇª?
 Naruto?
 I see. The idea isnΓÇÖt bad.
 Then, how about this?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Heh!
 Catch meΓÇªif you can!
 Not badΓÇª
 However, you are not the only one who uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 Dang it!
 SonΓÇªofΓÇªa...!
 Now then, next.
 Hold it!
 I found you!
 Wait!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 Get off!
 There! No, actually, here!
 Here!
 There!
 There!
 Hold it!
 Have you reached your limit?
 YouΓÇÖre freaking pesky!
 Give it up already!
 What are you snapping back at me for?
 This is a chase, so chasing is natural, right?
 T-True enoughΓÇª
 Naruto, you have understood my greatness by now, right?
 ItΓÇÖs about time you surrendered and moved on to training--
 The heck with that!
 IΓÇÖm going to bump you off, and receive Kakashi SenseiΓÇÖs training!
 Even if I have to knock you out!
 It appears you still have some spirit left.
 To think he would come at me head on, even though this is a chase.
 Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.
 As Kakashi said, heΓÇÖs the number one unpredictability Ninja.
 DonΓÇÖt take this badly!
 Eat this!
 Clone JutsuΓÇª?
 The game is over, Naruto!
 Dang it!
 Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles and salt-flavor ramen noodles!
 Here you go!
 Naruto, having been shown your movements and
 having further analyzed what Kakashi has told meΓÇª
 it is clear that you cannot control Chakra well.
 ControlΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Now then, comparing you with Sasuke and Sakura ΓÇª
 I shall explain your bad points in order.
 As you know, in the case of using Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,
 Ninjas build up Chakra and activate the Jutsu.
 I-I know that already!
 Is that so?
 Then, in the case of comparing the three of you,
 I shall explain specifically how you are inferior.
 ThatΓÇÖs kind of an irritating way of saying it.
 IΓÇÖm treating you the ramen as promised,
 so be quiet and listen!
 First, let us say that Sakura uses Clone Jutsu.
 Clone Jutsu!
 In her case, her build-up control as well as her control of Chakra is perfect,
 so she can make clones without using wasteful energy.
 Cha!
 Next, in SasukeΓÇÖs case,
 he is somewhat poor at building up Chakra.
 Clone Jutsu.
 But, his control of Chakra is perfect,
 so both he and Sakura can make five clones.
 But, he uses a bit more wasteful Chakra than Sakura.
 Oh!
 So SasukeΓÇÖs nothing special.
 In your case, thereΓÇÖs no time to be laughing at others.
 Huh?
 You are very poor at building up Chakra and controlling it,
 so you cannot make clones with the same amount of Chakra.
 In the case where you strain to make clones despite that,
 after consuming a much larger amount of Chakra than Sakura and SasukeΓÇª
 Clone Jutsu!
 ...you can barely make one clone at best.
 By the way,
 Sakura and Sasuke can become ten with the same amount of Chakra.
 Like this, the three of you are this different even using the same Jutsu.
 Well, this is a somewhat exaggerated comparison of you three,
 but you build up too much Chakra, use too much physical strength,
 and your Jutsu activation is also unstable.
 But, thereΓÇÖve been times when I was greater than Sakura and SasukeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs only because you happen to have
 the most outstanding stamina of the three!
 Well, I am pretty sure that your Chakra control
 is getting difficult due to the influence of the Nine-TailsΓÇª
 which is the origin of your stamina.
 Anyway, there is no mistaking that you can become strong
 if you carry out the training we will be doing from now.
 Huh?! Really?!
 I guarantee it.
 Now then, letΓÇÖs go.
 Sir, your bill.
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs right.
 Wha--?!
 Thank you very much!
 WeΓÇÖve come quite a long wayΓÇª
 But, this is a hot spring town, right?
 It doesnΓÇÖt look like weΓÇÖve come here to leisurely soak in a hot springΓÇª
 Hey! Naruto!
 ThatΓÇÖs the womenΓÇÖs bath!
 I simply will not allow indecent behavior!
 Huh?
 IΓÇÖm not youΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not that I was trying to peep. Believe it!
 Thinking of something like that in the first place makes you a Closet Perv!
 WhatΓÇÖs with that look?
 N-Nothing.
 More importantly, whyΓÇÖve we come to a place like this?!
 Will soaking in a hot spring do anything for training?
 No!
 The training will be here in this hot spring area!
 Okay, this is the place.
 ItΓÇÖs a bath, sure enough!
 What are you saying?
 I said this is training, didnΓÇÖt I? Training!
 WeΓÇÖre going to train here?
 What the heck are we going to do?
 Walk on this hot water!
 What?!
 What is it?
 Walk on hot water?
 Can you really do that?
 Of course!
 I heard from Kakashi Sensei.
 You already did tree-climbing training without using your hands, right?
 ItΓÇÖs an application of that.
 HmmΓÇª 					What do you mean?
 Besides, I donΓÇÖt really remember stuff from long ago!
 In tree climbing, all you do is accumulate
 only the necessary amount of Chakra in one necessary location
 and maintain that amount of Chakra all the while.
 Trees are fixed objects, so you only need to be attached to it.
 In other words,
 itΓÇÖs training for building up a fixed amount of Chakra.
 To float on the surface of water,
 you have to discharge on a constant basis
 an appropriate amount of Chakra from your feet to the water
 and balance that to the extent that you can float your own body.
 Huh?
 This Chakra control is more difficult than maintainingΓÇª
 and is a control training for discharge and usage of fixed amount
 of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.
 Hmm, I really donΓÇÖt get it!
 Well, it would be better to show you in your case.
 First, you build up Chakra in your feet.
 Then, while constantly discharging a fixed amountΓÇª
 you balance it with your body weight.
 AndΓÇª
 well, this is how it goes.
 Oh! Okay! 					IΓÇÖm going to try!
 First, you build up Chakra in your feet.
 Then!
 Discharge a fixed amount. Right?
 Oh!
 I knew it.
 Hot-hot-hot-hot!
 I forgot to mention it, but this hot water is 60┬░ C.
 If you do nothing but failΓÇª
 you will become a boiled octopus!
 Dang it!
 IΓÇÖll do it no matter what!
 YouΓÇÖre unusually spirited today, honored grandson!
 My principle of guidance has finally gotten through!
 This would ordinarily be the time to go carry out
 a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.
 IΓÇÖve stopped doing that now!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 So you have finally understood.
 That the shortcut to becoming the Hokage is to do as I sayΓÇª
 There are no shortcuts!
 Huh?
 Brother Naruto said itΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre to become Hokage, be prepared for that!
 Oh!
 IΓÇÖm starting to get it!
 To think he would get the hang of the Chakra control this quicklyΓÇª
 I never thought, you would grow this much.
 Indeed, there are no shortcuts, in anythingΓÇª
 It appears I had the wrong idea about youΓÇª
 You are a much smarter teacher than I am.
 And, you were not just a Demon FoxΓÇª
 You were a splendid Hidden Leaf Village Ninja!
 Oh! Hot!
 Hm?! That isΓÇª!
 Humph! I donΓÇÖt know who you are or where youΓÇÖre from, butΓÇª
 I will not allow indecency!

 Those guys are pursuing us!
 What are you doing?!
 If theyΓÇÖre gonna steal this guy away from us anyway,
 it would be better to take care of him right here!

 itΓÇÖs certain that heΓÇÖll be sentenced to deathΓÇª
 ThereforeΓÇª
 Rather than having them take him away, it would be better toΓÇª!

 I can get our bearings from the position of the moon.
 ItΓÇÖs too dangerous to go back to the river.
 WeΓÇÖll continue straight through this forest to the capital.
 Because itΓÇÖs my mission.
 Are you sure itΓÇÖll be okay?
 What do you mean?
 You said earlier you were going to finish this guy off, right?
 I was talking about a worst-case scenario.

 You are in custody. YouΓÇÖre not allowed to talk!
 Wait a second!
 The Forest of BewildermentΓÇª
 You know something about this place?
 What do you know? Tell us!
 The Ninja Dropouts have a hide-out in this forest.
 What was that?!
 So we were escorting you through Ninja Dropout territoryΓÇª?!
 This forest is perfect for a hide-out.
 The fog, the winds that sweep through the forest,
 the extreme magnetic fieldsΓÇª
 They all make a person lose their sense of direction.
 A person finding himself in this forest for the first time
 will never find his way out.
 I donΓÇÖt believe thatΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way we wonΓÇÖt find our way outΓÇª?
 You guys wonΓÇÖt.
 Huh?
 But for me, a member of the Ninja DropoutsΓÇª
 the outcome will be different.
 I willΓÇª
 I will guide you through this forest.
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 For you, a Ninja Dropout, this forest is like your backyard, right?
 Okay then, letΓÇÖs have you guide us!
 Are you some kind of idiot?!
 ItΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts showed earlier on
 makes sense if you think that this is their gardenΓÇª
 And IΓÇÖll believe you when you say you have a hide-out here.
 Then even more soΓÇª
 Even more so, it's a no!
 HuhΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt you get it?
 This guy is gonna pretend to be guiding us out of the forest
 but will actually be taking us to the hide-out.
 TodorokiΓÇª
 This is an emergency situationΓÇª
 If we donΓÇÖt kill him, weΓÇÖll be killed.
 W-Wait a minute!
 NobodyΓÇÖs gonna careΓÇªif this guy dies!
 Todoroki!
 WhatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts had stolen up to nowΓÇª
 So I was torturedΓÇª
 Those guys donΓÇÖt want to rescue meΓÇª
 They just want to get that money back from me.
 Once they have the money back, those guys will kill me too.
 Do you really think IΓÇÖll believe that?
 Wait a second!
 The Ninja Dropouts hide-out is here in this forest, rightΓÇª?
 Which means itΓÇÖs like a backyard to them too,
 just like it is for GantetsuΓÇª
 Which means thatΓÇª
 Which means that what?
 Well, since we've trespassed into their garden
 itΓÇÖs likely that the Ninja Dropouts will come after us
 whether GantetsuΓÇÖs betrayed them or notΓÇª
 So I think our only option is to pin our hopes on this guyΓÇª
 Am I wrong?
 Hey, are you sure you know what youΓÇÖre doing?
 Yeah, everythingΓÇÖs fine.
 Those guys wonΓÇÖt figure out this kind of circuitous route.
 Can we really trust this guyΓÇª?
 What?!
 IΓÇÖm used to itΓÇÖs venom. ItΓÇÖs nothing.
 Are you really gonna be all right?
 YeahΓÇª
 Hey!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 No way!
 You fell for it. You fell for it!
 Here it comes!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!
 Die!
 YouΓÇÖre the one who fell for it!
 I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Transformation Jutsu.
 What was that?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now itΓÇÖs my turn!
 Rasengan!
 IΓÇÖm gonna strike you down!
 DonΓÇÖt think itΓÇÖs gonna be that easy to strike me down!
 Like I'll let you get away!
 Naruto!
 That guy! Trying to get away, huh!
 What are you doing?
 Th-That sound isΓÇª
 What?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Thanks to you we made itΓÇªGantetsu.
 What's with you guys?
 They want to fight, it seems.
 I wonΓÇÖtΓÇª I wonΓÇÖt be fooled. YouΓÇªyouΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.
 Todoroki!
 Stop it, Todoroki!
 You said you were going to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guyΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way IΓÇÖll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?!
 This guyΓÇª
 This guy killed my familyΓÇª he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was thatΓÇª?
 GantetsuΓÇª
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 ItΓÇÖs true that Gantetsu may be evil,
 but how is taking revenge out on him going to change things?!
 IsnΓÇÖt our mission to take Gantetsu to the capital?
 And IΓÇª I donΓÇÖt think that heΓÇÖs an evil person.
 Anyway, you leave me no choice if you wonΓÇÖt listen.
 IΓÇÖll stop you with all my strength!

 Hmm?
 Be sure to find Mistress Tsunade and bring her back toΓÇª
 You bet we'll find her and bring her right away!
 Naruto! I like kids with guts like you! I'm going to give this to you!
 This made Lee strongerΓÇª
 Huh?! What ?! What?!
 This is it!
 Wow!
 They're breathable and moisture-wicking,
 and perfectly designed for free movement, all in a beautiful, stylish package.
 You'll notice a difference immediately if you train with them on!
 They're going to grow on you!
 Before long, you'll be wanting to wear them all the time like Lee!
 Of course, I have a thing for them, too!
 Woooow!
 Why couldnΓÇÖt you bring a mirror or something
 instead of carrying around those things, you dork!
 Do you think they'll look good on me?
 Don't even think about it. Get a load of thatΓÇª
 Now that is truly dorky.
 Okay! This is the place!
 Here?!
 The gambling house frequented by the entire townΓÇª
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 What's wrong?
 Pervy SageΓÇª Why are they after me?
 You know, don't you, Pervert Sage? Tell me whyΓÇª
 They're not really after youΓÇª They're after what's inside of you.
 What on earth is this thing?
 It's a horrible demon that attacked Leaf Village, right?
 And was dreaded by all.
 So why do they want it so much?
 Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox is a demon
 that appears at each critical juncture throughout the ages
 destroying everything in its pathΓÇª
 And people feared it like an act of nature.
 The reason they want that thingΓÇª for what purpose.
 Honestly, I can't quite say.
 Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox is sealed up inside of youΓÇª
 they might be thinking they want that power in their control.
 It must be harsh to know
 that Ninja like them would keep coming after youΓÇª
 But well, that's your destiny!
 Now donΓÇÖt you worry, I'm going to protect--
 Then there's nothing to do but hurry up and get stronger! I've got to!
 Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,
 have her save Sasuke and get down to some serious training!
 That's just like this kidΓÇª
 A New Training Begins: I Will Be Strong!
 Th-This place has the highest antesΓÇª!
 Don't go fretting over every little thing!
 Let's go!
 Oh dear! Please wait!
 Hmm?
 What?
 The beautiful woman you want to ""research"" onΓÇª
 That's this Tsunade person?
 Whoa! ThatΓÇÖs sharp coming from you! And what about it?
 She's part of the Sannin thing like you, right, Pervy Sage?
 Yes, and what of it?
 HowΓÇªold is she?
 My age.
 Heck, she's an old lady.
 Yikes!
 Huh?!
 Th-This woman isΓÇª!
 Would you mind changing all of this money into chips for me?
 Oh no! She's really going for it!
 Just who is this? This ladyΓÇª
 You don't know?
 She's that woman with the famous aliasΓÇª
 Famous aliasΓÇª?
 So, wellΓÇªwhat kind of person is this Tsunade like?
 Oh, you want to know?
 Yeah.
 Let's seeΓÇª
 Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.
 Besides that, she's a diehard gambler and her face is known far and wide for it.
 Then we should have no problems finding her!
 If she's that famous!
 She's famous, all rightΓÇª Legendary, you might sayΓÇª
 Boss, what's this aliasΓÇª?
 The LegendaryΓÇª
 LegendaryΓÇª?
 Oh dear! They're all laughing!
 ΓÇô LegendaryΓÇª 					ΓÇô LegendaryΓÇª
 Sitting Duck!
 Yup! But no matter how famous Legendary Sitting Duck is,
 I doubt we'll find her right away.
 Why not?!
 She hates growing old so much
 she's probably used some special Jutsu to change her appearance.
 She's actually 50 years old,
 but no doubt she looks like she did when she was 20ΓÇª
 And not just that, recently I heard thatΓÇª
 she transforms into her teens or 30s or 40s as the situation calls for
 to escape moneylenders.
 What?! That's a horrible thing to do!
 Tsunade has always loved to gamble more than anything
 But she has terrible luck and no skill.
 She was always being played for the Sitting Duck and the name stuckΓÇª
 Then she was always borrowing money and skipping out on her debts, tooΓÇª
 Ah, it brings back memories.
 This is no time to be getting all nostalgic!
 Tell me, how do you propose we go about finding her?!
 WellΓÇª
 We may very well have to put our noses to the ground,
 but we're not without our little tricks.
 What?! So you have no idea how long it's gong to take?!
 We won't be wasting any time.
 All of our time on the road will be your time.
 My time?
 Time to make you strongΓÇª Training!
 Okay!
 No, noΓÇª I told you that is definitely out.
 I won't be seen walking with someone dressed like that.
 Come on, Pervy Sage! Let's hurry up and start training!
 Now now, don't get ahead of yourselfΓÇª
 The training won't mean anything
 unless it's done in the process of gathering information on Tsunade.
 Huh? Gathering informationΓÇª?
 In this town.
 Wow!
 Cool! This is my first time for this kind of thing!
 Down time is important, too!
 You go have yourself some fun before we start training.
 The festival should continue for some time.
 We'll stay here in this city for the duration.
 We'll train here, too!
 All right!
 Whoa! That's a fat wallet! You're rich!
 I have quite a bit!
 I've saved it little by little throughout my missions.
 Well then!
 ΓÇô Wait! Naruto! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 I'll hold on to your wallet for you!
 Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
 You can spend this muchΓÇª
 What?! Only 300 ryo!
 No complaints!
 Remember Shinobi must honor the "" ShinobiΓÇÖs Three Taboos""!
 ShinobiΓÇÖs Three TaboosΓÇª? What's that?
 What?! You don't know!
 The ""three taboos"" are the three temptations
 that will bring Shinobi to ruin!
 The three temptations are booze, women and moneyΓÇª
 Oh, then this doesn't really apply to me all that much!
 I'm minor, so I can't drink yet! I don't quite get the women thing!
 And I worked so hard to save all that money,
 I don't really feel much like using itΓÇª
 You fool! Don't you underestimate the desire for money!
 Once you start using it, it goes really fast!
 Money has a frightful power.
 This Tsunade we are going to be looking for
 has ruined herself over it!
 Your desire for women is always  getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!
 I'm going on an information-gathering mission!
 Here, you hold on to my bag for me!
 If you get lost,
 my tracking SummonsToad will follow my scent!
 He's really just a child after all, contrary to appearancesΓÇª
 Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat!
 IΓÇÖll take one order of octopus dumplings, sir!
 Right!
 ΓÇô Potatoes with butter please! ΓÇô You got it!
 ΓÇô I want chocolate bananas. ΓÇô Right!
 ΓÇô I want apricot candy! ΓÇô Thank you!
 ΓÇô I want okonomiyaki too! ΓÇô Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!
 One extra-large order of fried noodle, sir!
 RightΓÇªBut my you've got a lot of food there, young man!
 You don't plan to eat it all yourself now, do you?!
 Eh? As a matter of fact, I am gong to eat it all myself.
 Oh, um, here you goΓÇª
 I think I ate a bit too much.
 I wonder how everyone is?
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª SasukeΓÇª SakuraΓÇª
 I'm going to train hard every day and come back stronger.
 Just you wait and see!
 But before thatΓÇª I better work off that meal!

 That's the fruit of hard training throwing shuriken.
 You stink, sonny!
 Hah! Gosh darn it! Well, just watch this!
 Hold it!

 You shouldn't try to walk around with the mask on.

 Two grilled squids please, sir! Make one of those an adult size!
 Okay! Someone sent you to buy some squid, eh?!
 I'll throw in a child size for free! Coming right up!
 Hurray for you, sir! You're a man among men!
 Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right! I'll give you the adult one for half price!
 Thanks!
 Good grief, where did he go to?!
 Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?
 Young ladies are so nice.
 Oh, Naruto! You've already had you're fill of the festival?
 Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!
 You're breaking all three at once! You bastard!
 W-Wait, NarutoΓÇª
 N-No, I won't wait!
 You used all my hard-saved money!
 ΓÇô Take this and this and this! ΓÇô N-Naruto, stop!
 I'll pay it all back! I'm sorry, p-please!
 You! You! You made my froggy wallet all flat!
 Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!
 You stained Leader's designer suit! You'll have to pay for it!
 Fork over 100,000 ryo!
 What?! You're telling me that suit cost 100,000 ryo?!
 Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch
 to say a dorky suit like that cost 100,000 ryo.
 Are you asking for it?!
 You better put a lid on it if you know what's good for you.
 The leader used be a Chunin from the Hidden Village of Stones,
 the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!
 Come again? Legendary what?
 You seem to want to get hurt!
 Naruto.
 Perfect timing.
 I'll show you a Jutsu nowΓÇª Watch very carefully!
 Now you've done it!
 A-Amazing!
 I was holding back quite a bitΓÇª You guys are so weak.
 A-Are you? TheΓÇªlegendaryΓÇª
 I'm sorryΓÇª We kind of destroyed your standΓÇª
 H-HereΓÇª Fix it with this.
 Oh! Thanks.
 Would you mind if I bought all your balloons and water balloons
 at the same time, my man?
 Fine by meΓÇª
 That wasnΓÇÖt an ordinary hand moveΓÇª
 What in blazes was that?! That Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 Come with me! ItΓÇÖs training time!
 Yes, sir!
 Finally, the mood is right for a little training.
 ΓÇô Here! Water balloon! ΓÇô Wha--?
 Eh?! What is it for?!
 You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?
 Y-Yeah.
 What Jutsu did it look like to you?
 It looked like you made your opponent spin violently.
 His perspective's offΓÇª But I guess that's to be expected.
 Right, okayΓÇª Yes, spinning!
 He's spinning the water in the balloon without moving his hand?!
 Whoa!
 The tree-climbing exercise
 to learn to gather and maintain Chakra in necessary placesΓÇª
 The Walk-on-Water exercise
 to learn how to release a set amount of ChakraΓÇª
 You did both of these, right?
 And now with this water balloon exercise,
 you'll learn how to create a stream of ChakraΓÇª
 In other words, spinning.
 Create a stream of ChakraΓÇª
 I'll give a more detailed explanation of the Jutsu
 once you get these first steps down.
 First, you must gather and maintain Chakra in your hand
 using the tree-climbing technique.
 Then you must continuously release Chakra
 using the Walk-on-Water technique.
 Then you push and churn the water in the balloon with the Chakra!
 I get it!
 Then you spin the water in the balloon faster and faster
 until the balloon pops!
 You're catching on more and more quickly!
 Okay, today we're going to train until evening!
 Yes, sir!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 I will break this water balloon no matter what!
 Hey, you're full of spirit!
 Perhaps I can expect him to master the Jutsu.
 The water inside the balloon is moving.
 By the way, when does that pop?
 Next time: ΓÇ£Keep on Training: Pop Goes the Water Balloon!ΓÇ¥
 Aw geez! Why won't it pop?!

 You yourself said you werenΓÇÖt fired up, right?
 IΓÇÖm not fired up!
 ItΓÇÖs a mission to catch a petty thief.
 ItΓÇÖd be the same no matter who went on the mission.
 Look. Under normal circumstances,
 a three-man team of Kiba, Hinata and Shino would be fundamental.
 But unfortunately, Shino is absent as heΓÇÖs off on a different mission.
 ItΓÇÖd be better if even you were there than not, right?
 What, Old Lady?! ThatΓÇÖs taking it too far!
 IΓÇÖll do my best.
 This is a mission I kind of canΓÇÖt get into, though.
 ThereΓÇÖs probably no need to take the trouble to determine a troop leader.
 Anyway, your mission is to capture the man who stoleΓÇª
 the Misogi tea jar owned by the feudal lord of the Land of Tea.
 This man, Gosunkugi.
 According to sources, heΓÇÖs now hiding in the Land of Stone.
 Get over there lickety-split and catch him lickety-split.
 Hearing that makes me feel less fired up than ever.
 Here, Akamaru.
 Well, missions like this are okay once in a while, right?
 LetΓÇÖs take it easy.
 It's a cinch mission, so all the more reason I want to finish it up quick.

 IΓÇÖm sorry, Naruto.
 IΓÇªum, I was so happy to be on a missionΓÇªwith you.

 WhatΓÇÖre you blushing for? YouΓÇÖre a weird one.
 Well, hold your horsesΓÇª Look.
 WeΓÇÖll be in the Land of Stone once we cross that mountain pass.

 LetΓÇÖs seeΓÇª
 There are people who offer a bounty in order to capture bad guys.
 And a bounty hunter catches those bad guys and receives the bounty.
 Hmm.
 Then this guy has a bounty on him, right?
 Boy, thatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 WhyΓÇÖs there so much money on his head?

 Boy, this guyΓÇÖs a super A-rank bounty
 who has killed dozens of people for the sake of stealing.
 What?!
 No way.
 Say what?
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this? I havenΓÇÖt heard about that.
 The feudal lord who commissioned this mission
 might not have known about that.
 Mission?
 Yeah. WeΓÇÖre Hidden Leaf Ninja
 and we came to this town to capture Gosunkugi.
 Leaf?
 So youΓÇÖre Ninja, huh?
 This is interesting.
 So even kids like this are qualified to be Ninja?
 What?! DonΓÇÖt make fun of us!
 Well, donΓÇÖt get so mad. Sorry about thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll treat you guys to something. Milk?
 WeΓÇÖre not Akamaru. I want ramen!
 Then IΓÇÖll have a hamburger steak with cheese.
 I-I-I guess IΓÇÖll have ramen, too.
 Okay. Come with me.
 Jeez, no way would there be ramen in a bar.
 Hey, old man. Would even miso ramen topped with pork be okay?
 Sure, have anything you like.
 What is this? WeΓÇÖre rapidly moving away from town.
 I donΓÇÖt see a ramen shop anywhere.
 Now thenΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt see any ramen shops.
 So what I said earlier about treating you guys is canceled.
 Sorry, but you guys are going to die here.
 O-Old manΓÇª
 You guys are going to die here.
 Hey, old manΓÇªWhatΓÇÖs the idea?
 To think you guys would know that Gosunkugi is in this town.
 So what if we do know?
 Gosunkugi is my preyΓÇª I canΓÇÖt hand him over to you.
 Knock it off! You should just go get him yourself.
 No, even if you guys are kids,
 itΓÇÖs a different story when it comes to Leaf Ninjas.
 ItΓÇÖs better to have fewerΓÇª wait, no competitors.

 Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail.
 Gosunkugi, here I come!
 You canΓÇÖt move anymore.
 ItΓÇÖs over.
 Finish him.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Gosunkugi, youΓÇÖre under arrest!
 Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?
 Retreat!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 Wait.
 BoyΓÇª
 You must not go.
 Old man!
 H-Hey, Old Man Sazanami.
 Stay away from him. HeΓÇÖs too much for you guys.
 How could such a strong guy be beaten?
 Gosunkugi isnΓÇÖt a mere thief.
 HeΓÇÖs a Shinobi, same as us.
 Shinobi.
 Sazanami!
 Is this one of GosunkugiΓÇÖs comrades?
 You! As I recall, you were in the bar beforeΓÇª
 Damn!
 Who was that guy?
 Hm, what?
 A wanted flyer.
 Did he mistake us for Gosunkugi?
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it.
 ""This man who calls himself Tokichi is a major criminal
 who has killed a family of threeΓÇª""
 ""He has a bird-shaped birthmark on his chest.""
 A bird-shaped birthmarkΓÇª? lt couldnΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 What is it, Hinata?
 I can't tell because his face is covered with scarsΓÇª
 But he hasΓÇªa bird-shaped birthmark.
 Oh!
 He has a bounty on his head, too?
 What the heck is going on with everything?
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 A long, long time ago just recently, on an overcast clear dayΓÇª
 It was night since morning.
 The righteous rogue SazanamiΓÇÖs string of his past unwinds and frays.
 Ah, the fatal foe Gosunkugi!
 Although the situation is now clear to me,
 there are times when a Shinobi cannot back out!
 Hey, hey, hey, Gosunkugi!
 Give it up and submit to arrest!

36,"Press down hard on the gas
 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 IΓÇÖveΓÇªhad itΓÇª
 Oh, Sakura!
 For crying out loud, how far have we walked?
 The tower hasnΓÇÖt gotten a bit closer.
 Here we can see it right in front of our eyes.
 StrangeΓÇª
 No mistake about it.
 It seems that weΓÇÖre already within the enthusiastic welcome.
 Take a look at that.
 Huh?
 Oh, that canΓÇÖt be!
 What on earth is going on?!
 No way!
 Is it GenjutsuΓÇª?
 So it seems. We were lured in perfectly.
 It appears we were meticulously careful,
 and were made to walk around the same place in a circle.
 WeΓÇÖre being watchedΓÇª
 Probably.
 They intend to wear down our physical strength and
 catch us unprepared when  weΓÇÖre bone-tired.
 If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
 Then.... TheyΓÇÖll be coming soon.
 Humph, theyΓÇÖve appeared.
 This is the perfect handicap.  Believe it!
 Clone vs. Clone: Mine are Better than Yours!
 W-What is this?
 ItΓÇÖs quite a number.
 Moreover, theyΓÇÖre clones?
 Cornered rats.
 Shut up!
 Oh, theyΓÇÖre quite weak, huh?
 Good!
 Naruto!
 W-What are these guys?
 W-WhatΓÇÖs going on here?
 IΓÇÖll assess this!
 Sharingan!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 My bodyΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Are you okay?
 No mistake.
 ItΓÇÖs the real thing, not an illusion.
 ΓÇô Scroll please. ΓÇô Scroll please.
 That Kabuto was injured means these things are actual Shadow Clones?!
 B-But... even though Shadow clones are supposed to vanish
 if they take a direct attack, these things don't vanish.
 Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!
 Which is it?!
 Scroll please.
 Scroll please.
 Give me scroll.
 Dang it!
 ItΓÇÖs futile!
 Stop!
 These things are illusions.
 ItΓÇÖs an enemy Genjutsu.
 B-But, KabutoΓÇÖs wound is the real thing.
 No, itΓÇÖs as Sasuke says.
 Probably the enemy is hiding somewhereΓÇª
 and coordinating their attack with movements of the ΓÇ£Genjutsu ShinobisΓÇ¥
 and attacking from a different location.
 Pretending as if those Genjutsu Shinobis are attacking.
 ΓÇô Scroll please. ΓÇô Scroll please.
 Then IΓÇÖll find the idiot whoΓÇÖs behind the scenes
 throwing Kunai knives and kick his butt, believe it!
 Hold it, Naruto.
 WeΓÇÖve been deceived as to the source of the Kunai knivesΓÇª
 so we canΓÇÖt discover the precise location of the enemy like this.
 Do you get it?
 That is the enemyΓÇÖs purpose.
 From a data standpoint, itΓÇÖs a type who is weak at close combat
 and Taijutsu that likes this kind of attack. 95	02:22:38:03	02:22:42:29 							The true enemy wonΓÇÖt come out 		until we canΓÇÖt move at all.
 Listen, everyone!
 In any case,
 all there is to do now is to fend off the enemy attack.
 Fine, if thatΓÇÖs what their plan isΓÇª
 Now thenΓÇª I wonder how far they can hold out.
 The night is long.
 Man! 					This is endless!
 Since itΓÇÖs come to thisΓÇª!
 Stop!
 Naruto, donΓÇÖt waste your Chakra!
 Even if you attack these things, thereΓÇÖs no point!
 If I hit them all in a single sweep,
 the enemy wonΓÇÖt fire inadvertently while these things are reverting back.
 The hiding place will be discovered, so.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clones?!
 ItΓÇÖs not over yet!
 Sasuke, what should we doΓÇª?
 Man, that loser. All there is to do is go for it!
 B-ButΓÇª
 IndeedΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not a situation that he can get through by himself.
 LetΓÇÖs go, Sakura!
 Y-Yeah!
 IΓÇÖm not finished yetΓÇª
 Dawn is breaking.
 ItΓÇÖs finally time for the hunt.
 Mubi, thatΓÇÖs enough.
 WeΓÇÖre finished hunting their spirits.
 Now whatΓÇÖs left is just their bodies.
 Lucky.
 YouΓÇÖreΓÇªthe one whoΓÇª did my left shoulder.
 I finally found you.
 You really hung me up.
 Lucky.
 I can finally even the score.
 YouΓÇªreally hung me up.
 Lucky.
 I can finally even the score.
 Heh!
 Cornered rats.
 It went well, Naruto!
 W-What the heck are these guys?!
 T-This canΓÇÖt be!
 Since whenΓÇª?!
 Idiot!
 You finally showed your true colors, punk!
 T-This brat, donΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª
 The Shadow Clone is just the preparation for the trick...
 for me to portray every member of the team by myself!
 At the same time Naruto lifted the Shadow Clone,
 the three of us hid.
 The Genjutsu users were adversely deceived.
 Naruto!
 Naruto, youΓÇÖve used too much Chakra.
 IΓÇÖll do the rest.
 No way! IΓÇÖm not always going to have the good parts taken away!
 Is this really that NarutoΓÇª?
 Since when had he improved this much?
 ThatΓÇÖs some bratΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt believe he can still move.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Amazing Chakra staminaΓÇª
 Right after a Multiple Shadow Clone JutsuΓÇª
 a daring technique that transforms just three of the bodies into his companions.
 To think he can still move even after doing all that.
 Here itΓÇÖs the fifth day now.
 This kid will transform
 if he can just master the use of his Chakra.
 Not bad.
 But weΓÇÖre still not unlucky.
 ThereΓÇÖs no time.
 This time around, weΓÇÖll show you our Ninjutsu!
 Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow clones?
 No, they are plain clones.
 However, he's up to something.
 Be careful!
 Hah! If they are just clones, then thereΓÇÖs one real body.
 IΓÇÖll kick their butts right and left until I run into him.
 You idiot.
 Such a tactless thingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm telling you!
 IΓÇÖm saying donΓÇÖt stick your nose in!
 Naruto!
 ThatΓÇÖs reckless!
 Cripes!
 From earlier, the nape of my neck hurts when I use the Sharingan.
 Maybe I used too much Chakra.
 Dang it!
 Dang it. A clone?!
 This one, too?!
 This one, too?!
 This one, too?!
 Naruto! Stop!
 Are they all fakes?!
 Or could it be Genjutsu again?!
 This isΓÇª the lastΓÇªChakra.
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke!
 The bruise againΓÇª
 Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!
 It wonΓÇÖt do to create an opening!
 Kabuto!
 Darn it!
 Stop! Naruto!
 No matter how much you swing at them,
 the real body isnΓÇÖt in those clones.
 Then whereΓÇÖs the enemy attacking us from?!
 If they are merely clones, the clones themselves canΓÇÖt attack!
 If I knew that, we wouldnΓÇÖt be having a rough time of it!
 This is the enemyΓÇÖs scheme.
 Man, I canΓÇÖt use the Shadow Clone Jutsu anymoreΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖve about reached their limit.
 Lucky.
 ThatΓÇÖs it!
 The real body hides with the Earth Style Jutsu
 and attacks from behind a clone!
 Kabuto!
 Heh, ΓÇ£it wonΓÇÖt do to create an opening,ΓÇ¥ right?!
 Thank you, Naruto. You saved me.
 We're okay here, Naruto!
 What happened there?  Are you hurt?
 ThatΓÇÖs a terrible bruise.
 ItΓÇÖs nothing.
 Here it is, here it is!
 Look, the Heaven scroll!
 Good for you.
 ThereΓÇÖs something about this guy... that I donΓÇÖt like.
 Oh, itΓÇÖs you guys.
 YouΓÇÖre late, Kabuto.
 I got a bit involved in something.
 Sorry.
 But, butΓÇª thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.
 No, itΓÇÖs because you guys fought hard.
 You were amazing at the end, Naruto.
 WeΓÇÖre going through this door.
 Well then, I wish us both luck.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 What of the harvest?
 Yes.
 More than I expected.
 I filled in his entire data from this second exam.
 You need this, right?
 So, how was it?
 Sure enough, it appears youΓÇÖre curious.
 Master Orochimaru.
 I want to ask your opinion.
 As a Sound VillageΓÇÖs spyΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not necessary, is it?
 You will be the one to decide it all, soΓÇª
 I like that cleverness of yours.
 Good work.
 ThereΓÇÖs nobody here.
 IΓÇÖm okay now, Sakura.
 O-Okay.
 ThatΓÇÖs too bad!
 Cha!
 Say-say, whatΓÇÖre we supposed to do?
 Oh! Look at thatΓÇª
 WithoutΓÇª HeavenΓÇª I donΓÇÖt get it at all.
 If ΓÇ£HeavenΓÇ¥ does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 If ΓÇ£EarthΓÇ¥ does not exist,
 run the fields in search of an advantage.
 Open the series of Heaven and Earth,
 and the perilous way shall be redressedΓÇª
 This is namely the secret of ΓÇ£the one that guidesΓÇªΓÇ¥
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 It looks like there are letters or something missing there.
 ItΓÇÖs probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means weΓÇÖre supposed to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, IΓÇÖm going to open it.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 WhatΓÇÖs this, whatΓÇÖs this?
 Here I thought that the really strong ones were remaining,
 but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru, all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 And that LeeΓÇÖs team, too.
 So much for getting all inflated.
 Well, IΓÇÖm the man whoΓÇÖs going to become the Hokage.
 I must impress them and
 show that IΓÇÖm not in the same class as any ordinary blockhead!

 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 The Dark Creeping Clouds
 ComeΓÇªcomeΓÇªcomeΓÇª
 The villagers are welcoming us.
 Everyone seems to be safe.
 It seems like the Kurosuki Family ran away in fear.
 HeyΓÇª
 Here they come!
 Naruto! DonΓÇÖt comeΓÇª
 If you value your life, be quiet.
 KarashiΓÇª
 I heard that you were deeply sorry for your actionsΓÇª!
 How could I shamelessly run back to the curry house?!
 Now!
 Did you see that?!
 Although Master Raiga is not around, the Kurosuki Family is eternal!
 HeyΓÇªwhat are you looking for?
 IsnΓÇÖt it obvious? The brats!
 Are you referring to us?
 What?!
 What you crushed were our forms
 made by the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Transformation Jutsu.
 Take formation!
 Ninja Art: Black Tornado!
 Wha--?
 Those were also made by
 the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Transformation Jutsu!
 We saw through everything!
 Here I go.
 Leaf Hurricane!

 ItΓÇÖs already overΓÇª
 What?! Not fair!
 Man! You couldΓÇÖve saved some for me!
 Just when I thought IΓÇÖd try the new Jutsu!
 Gosh, you never learn, do you!
 Karashi, are you prepared?
 I was just kidding!
 How dare you torment us!
 You really think weΓÇÖll let this slide as a joke?
 I couldnΓÇÖt help it! If I didnΓÇÖt listen,
 I would have gotten killed by the Kurosuki family.
 In place of the Kurosuki family,
 IΓÇÖll crack your head with this hammer!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Please move, Lee!
 Please hit me until you guys are satisfied.
 Why you?
 ItΓÇÖs partly my responsibility
 that the once kind-hearted Karashi went and joined a gang.
 Yours?
 Because of me,
 he got the impression that power is everything.
 Right, thatΓÇÖs right!
 Though I knew that itΓÇÖs a bad thing, I just had toΓÇª
 You be quiet!
 Karashi is still inexperienced.
 But he has skills to make curry that can save peopleΓÇÖs lives.
 Please give Karashi the opportunity to make amends by making curry.
 If Karashi goes astray again, then I willΓÇª!
 Punish him with my fists!
 Everyone, what do you think
 about letting Lee and Grandma Sansho take care of this situationΓÇª
 After all, he was just an underling of the Kurosuki family.
 ItΓÇÖs not like he directly attacked us or anythingΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs have Lee educate him harshlyΓÇª
 In that caseΓÇª
 Thank you very much!
 Th-Thank youΓÇª
 And with this, our mission is complete.
 No, not yetΓÇª
 Huh?
 Are you all right?
 WhatΓÇÖs the point of being all right?
 I canΓÇÖt live alone.
 DonΓÇÖt say that!
 Why donΓÇÖt we just leave this weakling!
 Everyone has to live alone!
 But donΓÇÖt you need friends who can help you and stuffΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm talking about some basics! I hate people who are indecisive!
 I was frail from the time I was born.
 That shabby cabin was the entire world for me.
 I have no memory of my parentsΓÇª
 I survived only by the small amount of food
 that the villagers sometimes brought meΓÇª
 But even someone like me had a power that no one else did.
 Here you go.
 Thank youΓÇª
 Is your leg okay? The one you cut with the scythe?
 D-Did I tell you that story?!
 NoΓÇªI kind of found outΓÇª
 How? No one else besides me came today or yesterday, right?
 No, I just saw it from hereΓÇª
 Scary!
 As time went by everyone began to fear me since I had the power
 to know what was happening outside even from my room.
 Did you know?!
 I heard that Ranmaru has the ability to see everythingΓÇª
 Were we being spied on every day?
 Get out of the village!
 You monster!
 And so I had no more visitorsΓÇª
 All I could do was to wait to die.
 ThatΓÇÖs when Raiga saved meΓÇª
 I see. What a bitter past.
 Yes, it is.
 HmmΓÇª
 Raiga took me out to the unknown world.
 Ranmaru, try opening your eyesΓÇª
 This is the outside world where weΓÇÖll be living from now onΓÇªokay?
 OkayΓÇª
 If Raiga isnΓÇÖt here, itΓÇÖs the same as losing my body. 131.01	01:36:52:09	01:36:54:13	Perhaps Raiga became known
 as one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist
 because he was able to borrow your power.
 It seems like you two helped each other to liveΓÇª
 Yes.
 ThatΓÇÖs not true!
 You were being used for RaigaΓÇÖs evil deeds!
 I might have beenΓÇªusedΓÇª
 But good or bad doesnΓÇÖt matter to me. IΓÇÖm just a sense organΓÇª
 Then that wonΓÇÖt mean that youΓÇÖre really living!
 Huh?
 See, you have to do your best to live from now on!
 Firstly, eat the curry of life and cheer up!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! You will get nourishment.
 That will hurt the body instead, wouldnΓÇÖt it?
 Naruto, you canΓÇÖt eat it either, right?
 Actually, the more I eat it,
 the more energized my body feelsΓÇª
 That curry saved my life, you know!
 Until the day youΓÇÖre able to walk alone,
 I will become your body!
 Okay?
 I have one favor to askΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª?
 Byakugan!
 As I expectedΓÇª I can no longer see life in Raiga.
 Can you see, Ranmaru?
 Yes.
 Is this okay?
 YesΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs goΓÇª Mission is complete.
 Hey!
 What?
 That is--!
 One, two, one, two.
 Grandma Sansho!
 WhatΓÇÖs all this ruckus?! Dust will go into the curry.
 L-Lee and the others came back!
 K-Karashi is with them!
 Is it worth the ruckus?
 Grandma, arenΓÇÖt you happy?
 One, twoΓÇª One, twoΓÇª
 Your snot will go in!
 Grandma Sansho! IΓÇÖm back!
 Karashi is here too!
 M-Mom, sorry! Please forgive me!
 Please forgive himΓÇª
 He says heΓÇÖll devote himself from now on,
 and train to take over the Curry of Life Shop, so pleaseΓÇª
 First you gotta eatΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª
 Wow, it looks good!
 If youΓÇÖre not going to eat, I will!
 IΓÇÖve prepared some for each of youΓÇª
 Oh my, thatΓÇÖs a very pale child.
 Yeah, can you prepare some for him too?
 Especially mildΓÇª
 I prefer mild tooΓÇª
 Oh myΓÇª
 MomΓÇªthanks for the food!
 ItΓÇÖs a punishment times 300 curryΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs spicy, itΓÇÖs spicyΓÇª
 But itΓÇÖs good! ItΓÇÖs good, Mom!
 Here, I have some for everybody!
 ItΓÇÖs okay, itΓÇÖs mild.
 By the way, you were part of
 the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist with Raiga, right?
 Do you know a guy named Zabuza?
 ZabuzaΓÇªyou say?
 Uh thenΓÇª
 How about a guy with this huge sword wrapped with something like a bandage
 and has fish eyes?
 OhΓÇªthatΓÇÖs KisameΓÇª
 Yeah Kisame!
 So, do you know what heΓÇÖs up to right now?
 NoΓÇª I heard that he slipped out from the Mist Village.
 I know his face, but I donΓÇÖt know anything beyond that.
 I seeΓÇª
 Should I ask Grandma to make you something else?
 No, I donΓÇÖt need itΓÇª I donΓÇÖt want to eat anything.
 Thank you for your helpΓÇª
 Thank you very much.
 Make a good village with everyone!
 UmΓÇªwhere is Lee?
 His mission still isnΓÇÖt complete.
 Please wait, LeeΓÇª IΓÇÖm gonna die!
 Okay, letΓÇÖs take a break here!
 LetΓÇÖs do 300 push ups.

 Even if a real storm comes,
 it should be fine if we reinforce it with these big trees!
 Oh my, thanks for doing this.
 No, itΓÇÖs our thanks for the curry.
 Uh-uuh.
 But compared to you guys, my Karashi isΓÇª
 Tenten? IΓÇÖm worried about Karashi and Ranmaru
 whom we left behind at the curry shop.
 WeΓÇÖre okay, so could you check on them there?
 Karashi?!
 HeyΓÇª
 Is the Boss really still alive?
 That Neji person didnΓÇÖt seem to sense it thenΓÇª
 But I know.
 RaigaΓÇª
 OhΓÇª
 You were everything to me!
 I was only waiting to dieΓÇª
 when you told me that weΓÇÖll live on together!
 To me, being with you, was livingΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt hold a funeral for you either.
 Even if it costs me my life, I wonΓÇÖt let you die!
 Ranmaru!
 Did you die, Ranmaru?!
 KarashiΓÇª?
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today

 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you

 What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?!
 Then we gotta go save her right away!
 Please calm down! Naruto!
 Tenten canΓÇÖt be that clumsy.
 Huh? But thatΓÇÖs what Karashi said.
 Unfortunately, this might be some kind of trap.
 What? Trap?

 Well, didnΓÇÖt they get annihilated?

 Oh my, thereΓÇÖs a slight problem with the ingredientsΓÇª
 But there shouldnΓÇÖt be much difference in efficacy.
 ButΓÇª
 Oh myΓÇª!
 HeΓÇÖs coming this way.
 ItΓÇÖs okay! IΓÇÖll goΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre still alive?! I have to finish you offΓÇª
 RaigaΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre alive, Ranmaru?!
 ItΓÇÖs Ranmaru!
 That kid gave Raiga his own Chakra and brought him back to lifeΓÇª
 What?!
 Raiga looked at Ranmaru who was unconscious
 and assumed he was deadΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs why he was saying all that gibberish
 about Ranmaru watching from high above.
 And I managed to get Ranmaru to the Curry of Life Shop.
 So thatΓÇÖs what happenedΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll again be together forever, RanmaruΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs kill them and have fun doing lots of bad things.
 Right, RaigaΓÇª
 Some fog has appeared.
 ItΓÇÖs okay. IΓÇÖll be your eyes again, RaigaΓÇª
 Right. ThereΓÇÖs nothing to be afraid of if IΓÇÖm with you, Ranmaru.
 Now, letΓÇÖs go, Raiga!
 What about them?
 TheyΓÇÖre dead nowΓÇª
 RightΓÇªShall we search for our next prey?
 But thereΓÇÖs a precipitous cliff ahead!
 That Ranmaru, whatΓÇÖs he going to do?!
 Could it beΓÇª
 heΓÇÖs going to atone for the past sins together with Raiga?!
 He might be planning to lead Raiga over that cliff and die together!
 Wh-What?!
 WhatΓÇÖs with you, jerk?!
 What?!
 LeeΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª
 Here I goΓÇª!
 What?!
 YouΓÇªbrat!
 He suddenly recovered!
 Knock it off!
 HeΓÇÖs fast!
 You okay, Ranmaru?
 You stay here!
 Take me with youΓÇª
 Oh! Ranmaru!
 WhereΓÇÖd you go, Ranmaru?!
 You little--! YouΓÇÖre going to pay for this!
 Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!
 NowΓÇª
 Bring it!
 Knock it off!
 Here I goΓÇª
 That was a heck of a blow.
 If I hadnΓÇÖt put on the Thunder Armor; IΓÇÖd be giving myself a funeral.
 In order to remember your hard work IΓÇÖll give you your funeral myself!
 Wait!
 WhatΓÇÖs the ideaΓÇª?
 I want to feed youΓÇª the curry of life, too.
 Huh?!
 YouΓÇÖll realize that youΓÇÖre not alone if you eat the curryΓÇª
 EveryoneΓÇÖs feelings are blended inΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?!
 LetΓÇÖs stop hurting peopleΓÇª
 Cut it out!
 YouΓÇÖre my eyes and ears!
 WeΓÇÖll no longer be two people in one if you say such selfish things!
 Shoot your lightningΓÇª
 If I die, the strong Raiga will also dieΓÇª WeΓÇÖre two in one, soΓÇª
 IΓÇªwonΓÇÖt be able to remember you from when you were coolΓÇª
 I must give you a funeral!
 StopΓÇªRaiga!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 There are lots of NarutosΓÇª
 Did I get drunk?
 You little--! It makes no difference, no matter how many of you there are!
 Neji, wake up!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Neji?
 Eat this and get it together! WeΓÇÖve got trouble here!
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 What?!
 Now weΓÇÖve done itΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre going to kill by your own hand the friend who risked his life to save you?!
 Wha--?! Ranmaru betrayed meΓÇª
 He broke the promise for it to be just us two forever!
 HeΓÇÖs not all alone anymore!
 He figured out that itΓÇÖs more funΓÇª
 to laugh with everyone than to cry with you!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Ranmaru, you were going to die with Raiga, werenΓÇÖt you?!
 DonΓÇÖt be thinking about something like that anymore!
 YouΓÇÖre free now!
 Don't worry. I wonΓÇÖt let Raiga give you a funeral, no matter what!
 Hey, donΓÇÖt be shooting off your mouth, you shrimp.
 Say what?!
 DonΓÇÖt underestimate me. IΓÇÖm Raiga Kurosuki!
 IΓÇÖve been counted before as one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 I wonΓÇÖt take orders from the likes of you!
 Oh. ThatΓÇÖs right. HeΓÇÖs a Ninja Swordsman, huh?
 If youΓÇÖre one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist,
 then IΓÇÖve got something to ask you.
 You know the guy called Kisame, right?!
 Kisame? I hate that guy!
 So IΓÇÖll give him a funeral for sure the next time I see him!
 What?!
 I hate him.
 I hate all the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist!
 Ranmaru. YouΓÇÖre the only one whoΓÇÖs a friend to meΓÇª
 But RanmaruΓÇª youΓÇÖve made other friendsΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre not two in one anymoreΓÇª
 RaigaΓÇª
 Impudent!
 Who do you think taught you about the outside world?!
 ItΓÇÖs a funeral for you!
 Clone Spinning Axe Kick!
 You littleΓÇª
 CloneΓÇª Body Slam!
 RanmaruΓÇª
 Now you're freeΓÇª
 Raiga?!
 Thunder! Give me my funeral!
 One, twoΓÇª OneΓÇª
 Not loud enough!
 ΓÇô You canΓÇÖt make genuine curry of lifeΓÇª ΓÇô One, twoΓÇª
 ΓÇô if you donΓÇÖt stir it with all your heart! ΓÇô One, twoΓÇª
 Oh my!
 OuchΓÇª WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Mom?!
 Oh my, Karashi!
 ItΓÇÖs a hundred years too soon for you to be uttering the word ""genuine""!
 You too, start your training over again from the beginning!
 What?!
 Grandma Sansho!
 WeΓÇÖll be leaving now!
 Thanks for your help.
 I leave Ranmaru to you!
 Oh myΓÇª IΓÇÖll train him mercilessly as a successorΓÇª
 to the preparation of the curry of life!
 Good luck, Ranmaru, Karashi.
 ΓÇô Thanks! 					ΓÇô Thanks!
 Oh myΓÇª ItΓÇÖs a long way to the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 I made you guys some special curry
 thatΓÇÖll give you guys ten thousand times the strength.
 Be on your way after having some.
 WhatΓÇÖs this very spicy-looking bright red colorΓÇª?
 It kind of hurts my eyes, believe it!
 Oh! That looks good!
 ΓÇô What? Seriously?! ΓÇô What? Seriously?!
 Lady Tsunade will get mad at us if we donΓÇÖt get back soon!
 You're right!
 Unfortunately, weΓÇÖll have to be going now.
 Wait!
 Oh my, those kids were sure diffident and reservedΓÇª
 The curryΓÇª The curryΓÇª!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 OneΓÇÖs duty as team captain:
 ""Issue appropriate instructions to the subordinates,

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Sasuke!
 It will be necessary for you to die onceΓÇª
 Die once, you said?
 Mind Awakening Pill.
 You will take these.
 Mind Awakening PillΓÇª? What is that?
 Your Curse Mark level is at the first stateΓÇª
 These pills will forcibly stimulate
 the power of the Curse Marks to the second state.
 However, if you move up to the second state,
 the Curse MarkΓÇÖs erosion will accelerate drastically
 and if things are left that way you will die immediately!
 HoweverΓÇª
 In order to control the power of the second state,
 it is necessary to allow oneΓÇÖs body to get accustomed to it
 over the course of several hours.
 In doing so, you willΓÇª
 attain power that is equal to ours, howeverΓÇª
 Once awake, you canΓÇÖt possibly last more than a few minutesΓÇª
 and will certainly die!
 Sound vs. Leaf
 DieΓÇªand what will happen after that?
 You donΓÇÖt need to worry.
 ThatΓÇÖs why weΓÇÖre here.
 We will use Barrier Ninjutsu to suppress the side effects.
 We will mitigate that phase
 to ease you from eternal death to a state of half death.
 You really think I can put my faith in your Barrier Ninjutsu or whatever?
 Master SasukeΓÇª
 We normally function as Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs bodyguards!
 We know our stuff when it comes to Barrier or Defense Ninjutsu,
 Curse Marks and Sealing Jutsu!
 I absolutely cannot die yet!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 Hey!
 WeΓÇÖre gonna lose him if you guys are slow!
 Get into position!
 Begin!
 ΓÇô Four Black Mists Formation! ΓÇô Four Black Mists Formation!
 Black Seal!
 All right. We're done for now.
 Man, IΓÇÖm exhausted.
 I didnΓÇÖt think this mission would drag on this long.
 IΓÇÖll go check out the situation. LetΓÇÖs go, Raido!
 Right.
 Darn. This has sure gotten troublesome.
 ThereΓÇÖs oneΓÇª
 No, two of them.
 Here they come!
 You guys are OrochimaruΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Judging from the direction you came from,
 it appears that you are on your way back from the Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs in that barrel?
 Having two Jonin as opponentsΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs a tough one.
 Every one of them got the Curse MarksΓÇª
 You refuse to answer?
 This will be different from that time before with your surprise attack.
 Shut up, you scum!
 Just drop dead!
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs toysΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt you dare monkey around with Leaf Shinobi!
 Those two are really late, arenΓÇÖt they?
 What should we do, Shizune?
 LetΓÇÖs go see!
 Right!
 Shikamaru!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 ThereΓÇÖs a smell of blood nearby.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Raido! Genma!
 This isnΓÇÖt good!
 I canΓÇÖt believe these two could have been taken downΓÇª!
 The best I can do right now is give him some stop-gap treatmentΓÇª
 ShizuneΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm gonna hunt those guys down!
 No!
 B-ButΓÇª
 W-WaitΓÇªlwashi.
 Th-The Jutsu that those guys have is no longer that of mere ShinobiΓÇª
 If you pursue them alone, you'll only die.
 GenmaΓÇªdonΓÇÖt talk anymore!
 The smell of the other two impinged on the five others including SasukeΓÇª
 But the five are moving away from the smell of the blood!
 What should we do?!
 Just as I thought. He has guides.
 This has really turned into a real pain in the neck.
 LetΓÇÖs hurry up and pursue Sasuke!
 Shut up, Naruto!
 ThatΓÇÖs for Shikamaru to decide! DonΓÇÖt play the boss!
 Shikamaru?
 The fact that there was the smell of blood probably means
 that a battle occurred somewhere.
 If we go to that location we should be able to gather some informationΓÇª
 We must be attentive as we near the location,
 so we would have to switch over to
 a reconnaissance pattern and approach walking slowlyΓÇª
 While all thatΓÇÖs going on
 Sasuke will cross over the Land of Fire border!
 What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?!
 All right! LetΓÇÖs pursue Sasuke!
 All right! ThatΓÇÖs what I was waiting for!
 HoweverΓÇª
 The fact that there was a battle means theyΓÇÖll have their guard up.
 TheyΓÇÖll certainly be aware
 of the fact that there might be Ninja on their tail.
 In other words,
 the odds are high that there will be traps or an ambush.
 Listen carefullyΓÇª
 Hereafter, I want you to use your visual and acoustic senses to the fullest!
 We need to locate those guys before we get caught in an ambush!
 And if we come across anything suspicious,
 don't just dodge them, interpret them!
 All right!
 When we find them,
 IΓÇÖm gonna use my new Jutsu to clobber them!
 That NarutoΓÇª
 Each time I see him heΓÇÖs added a new Jutsu to his arsenal.
 Darn! Just when I thought I had caught up with himΓÇª
 Hey! The enemyΓÇÖs smell is everywhere!
 Everybody! Stop!
 Take a careful look above you.
 Paper BombsΓÇª
 And in five other places too!
 The figuration is that of a Perimeter Barrier.
 Perimeter BarrierΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu!
 Perimeter-type traps have a time lag and are activated
 when one enters the area that has been marked by the enemy.
 ItΓÇÖs advanced JutsuΓÇª
 It was in one of the books that my father made me read.
 Darn! Our only choice is to make a detourΓÇª
 LeeΓÇª Do what you have to do!
 Lee!
 ItΓÇÖs too soon to be doing that!
 Lady Fifth Hokage!
 I already know that youΓÇÖre a foolhardy guy.
 But youΓÇÖve just had an operation.
 You donΓÇÖt need to be rushing into things.
 I want to hurry up and do even a little training.
 I also want toΓÇª I want toΓÇª
 Building your strength isnΓÇÖt the only form of training.
 DonΓÇÖt you agree?
 It is said that Ninja are those
 who can forebear and endure any hardship.
 I understand how you feel butΓÇª
 That means that this too is one kind of training.
 TrainingΓÇª
 What if you were to do something foolhardy and you got worse?
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs that?
 ItΓÇÖs medicine that I prepared.
 First, drink this and get better!
 Right!
 Come, letΓÇÖs goΓÇª
 Yes, maΓÇÖam.
 Damn! Nothing but traps!
 Yeah, but the enemy seems pressed for time.
 The traps have noticeable flaws.
 Hey, hey, Naruto! ThereΓÇÖs wire at your feet!
 DonΓÇÖt trip on it!
 I know that already!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Shadow Possession JutsuΓÇª
 M-Made it just in the nick of time.
 Naruto! I told you to be careful!
 I seeΓÇª One of the wires is readily visible because it reflects light.
 The other wire has been coated with a matte green.
 So itΓÇÖs very difficult to see with the naked eye.
 ItΓÇÖs a double trap, huh.
 Despite the fact that theyΓÇÖre in a hurry,
 thatΓÇÖs certainly an elaborate trap.
 Which means thatΓÇª
 That theyΓÇÖre at rest.
 Perhaps they got injured, or that itself could be a trapΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 Caught ΓÇÿem!
 All right! All right! IΓÇÖll drag Sasuke back without fail!
 Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
 but IΓÇÖm gonna demonstrate my new Jutsu right here!
 Me too!
 DonΓÇÖt be so hasty.
 As soon as preparations have been made to implement my strategyΓÇª
 weΓÇÖll make direct contact with the target!
 Darn! When weΓÇÖre in a hurry, having to take a darn breakΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helped.
 When one fights at the second state, oneΓÇÖs body gets drained drastically.
 More than that,
 itΓÇÖs an ordeal not to be able to use oneΓÇÖs body for a whileΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helped with two Jonin-class guys as the opponents.
 If we act in moderation, weΓÇÖll be done in.
 KibaΓÇª
 In that event,
 donΓÇÖt mess up the timing of the Smoke Bombs.
 Got it!
 Now thenΓÇª
 we'll split up into two teams.
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Okay!
 It looks like they havenΓÇÖt noticed us yet.
 Hey, Sasuke's not around.
 It appears thatΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs inside that ΓÇ£coffin.ΓÇ¥
 Is he dead?!
 That barrel is secured with Barriers. I can't see through it.
 I wouldnΓÇÖt think that the guys who wanted Sasuke
 would kill him that easily.
 You might be right about that.
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Gimme a break, Shikamaru! You're not reliable in the least!
 And you still call yourself a leader?!
 But this situation sure is a problem.
 Leave this kind of thing to me. lt'll be a cinch.
 ΓÇô I sure hope it will be. ΓÇô What do you mean by that?!
 It's too much of a hassle to explain.
 ΓÇô Shut up, Akamaru! ΓÇô Shut up, Akamaru!
 What was that?! Give 'em some more, Akamaru!
 Well, if things come to this, I'll use that special weapon, Rasengan!

 What happened to Tenten?
 SheΓÇªfell from a cliff and..
 What?!
 What do you mean?!
 I was running with her and
 Tenten said that she would train me in place of LeeΓÇª
 But thereΓÇªwhen we were approaching the Lightning Pass,
 the lightning struck and a tree came falling and
 Tenten fell from the Pass to the bottom of the cliff!
 Oh my! Then you must go help her out immediately!

 Mom, please!

 merely because of the thunder?
 Huh? What do you mean?
 That KarashiΓÇª lt seems like he wasnΓÇÖt trained enough.

 This is the true curry of life.
 Here, please eat this.
 You canΓÇÖt even eat if youΓÇÖre not with Raiga?
 WhyΓÇª?
 WhyΓÇªfor a person like me?
 Does one need a reason to save someone?
 To save you,
 Grandma Sansho and Karashi did their best to make the curry.
 DonΓÇÖt you feel anything seeing those two trying their best?
 If you donΓÇÖt feel anything, youΓÇÖre a horrible human being!
 Human beings support each other in order to liveΓÇª
 If there are people who need help, donΓÇÖt others naturally lend them a hand?
 IsnΓÇÖt that being human?
 Anyway, one bite is fine. Why donΓÇÖt you try it?
 Was it good?
 That is what it feels like to live.
 Raiga ΓÇª
 I want him to eat this curry too.

 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away

 Sasuke!
 WhyΓÇª?!
 Why do you run away?!
 Sasuke!
 DonΓÇÖtΓÇª
 be staring atΓÇª
 people!
 HeΓÇÖs faster than earlier!
 The medicine from earlierΓÇª
 Was there some kind of special ingredient in it or somethingΓÇª?
 NotΓÇªbadΓÇª
 Moving around kind ofΓÇª made me feel super weirdΓÇª
 Oh, myΓÇª!
 What was thatΓÇªall of a suddenΓÇª?
 Did he reallyΓÇªfall asleepΓÇª?
 You fell for it, eh?!
 It looked like I was sleeping, but actually I wasnΓÇÖt!
 This is the Shinobi secretΓÇª!
 Guy SenseiΓÇªI did it!
 Guy SenseiΓÇªIΓÇªIΓÇª
 You fell for it yet again, huh?! Hey!
 YouΓÇÖre sorely mistaken if you think IΓÇÖm the kind of person
 to sleep spread-eagle in a place like this!
 IΓÇªIΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª? What am I doing in a place like thisΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇª?
 WhyΓÇª? WhyΓÇª?
 AlcoholΓÇª?
 HeΓÇÖs just drunk, huhΓÇª?
 If soΓÇªIΓÇÖll send you to another world before you can even feel painΓÇª
 Damn itΓÇª I donΓÇÖt have enough ChakraΓÇª
 At this rateΓÇª
 As might be expected, things will get hairy
 if I stay in the water any longer with this woundΓÇª
 Why wonΓÇÖt it hit?!
 And here I was sleeping comfortablyΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre a buzzing, annoying fly!
 Hey! Bring it on! Hey cΓÇÖmonΓÇª IΓÇÖll show youΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖreΓÇªthose movementsΓÇª?
 As you know, in that techniqueΓÇª
 one gets stronger the more one drinks and the more one gets drunk.
 I knowΓÇª
 At the restaurant beforeΓÇª
 When Lee mistook it for water and drank a small cup of alcoholΓÇª
 It took Neji and me, the both of us, to finallyΓÇªbe able to overpower Lee.
 You couldnΓÇÖt restrain him yourselfΓÇª?
 I could overpower him if I was fighting him as an enemyΓÇª
 But well, I couldnΓÇÖt inflict a serious injury on my beloved studentΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs how it was just with one small cup, soΓÇª
 If he were to drink an entire bottle of alcoholΓÇª
 An invincible strength, huhΓÇª?
 But itΓÇÖs just after he got out of the hospital.
 How long will his body hold on forΓÇª?
 A Loopy Fist User, huhΓÇª? ltΓÇÖs my first time seeing oneΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre not going to comeΓÇª then IΓÇÖll go!
 His attacks are straight as usualΓÇª
 Oh!
 Ouch!
 ItΓÇÖs your fault!
 IΓÇªIΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖm enjoying my youth!
 HeΓÇÖs too unorthodoxΓÇª
 And most of allΓÇªheΓÇÖs fast!
 Right in the middle of my youthΓÇª
 Dance of the Camellia!
 Here!
 I canΓÇÖt read his movementsΓÇª
 An attack on meΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs quite some TaijutsuΓÇª
 I have no choiceΓÇª
 My attack ability is bonesΓÇª
 You heard that earlier from the Clone brat, rightΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖll sober you up right away.
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªnot drunkΓÇªor anything!
 Then IΓÇÖll wake you up!
 IΓÇÖm not drunk or anything!
 In the first place, IΓÇÖm a minor!
 Minors shouldnΓÇÖt drink at all!
 Unorthodox, isnΓÇÖt itΓÇª? This is my Kekkei Genkai.
 Calm downΓÇªThink of a strategyΓÇª
 SeekΓÇªsome kind of possibilityΓÇª
 Humph. With that woundΓÇª
 It seems he wasnΓÇÖt able to escape very far at allΓÇª
 This is my limitΓÇª I canΓÇÖt moveΓÇª
 Damn itΓÇª HeΓÇÖs already caught up?
 AndΓÇª
 My headΓÇÖs poundingΓÇª
 And whatΓÇÖs with this woundΓÇª?
 It seems I was drunk, ehΓÇª?
 Your appearanceΓÇª!
 It seems youΓÇÖve sobered upΓÇª This is my Kekkei GenkaiΓÇª
 Kekkei GenkaiΓÇª
 My Kekkei Genkai freely controls osteoblastic and osteoclastic cellsΓÇª
 It even controls the concentration of calcium. It's an ability to form bones.
 Basically, there are over two hundred bones in the human bodyΓÇª
 But for me, thatΓÇÖs not a set number.
 But bones are bones, after all!
 If they break, they break!
 Wh-What a hardnessΓÇª!
 Are these really human bonesΓÇª?!
 If soΓÇª!
 Larch Dance.
 IΓÇÖve had itΓÇª
 A little moreΓÇªyou clod.
 ItΓÇÖs not like the time before with AsumaΓÇª
 A-Asuma!
 ThereΓÇÖs probably zero possibility of someone coming to help...
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs the point of thinking about someone helpingΓÇª?!
 Calm down!
 The smell is moving awayΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm savedΓÇª
 Who is?
 HowΓÇª?!
 I knew itΓÇª
 My coat?!
 It seems you didnΓÇÖt notice your own smell that youΓÇÖre routinely used to smellingΓÇª
 With that you erased your own smell?
 You understand well the attributes of scent. lt figures why I didnΓÇÖt smell you.
 AndΓÇªas would be expected,
 itΓÇÖs tough having you guys split up in two to search for meΓÇª
 Damn itΓÇª
 Please wait!
 The real dealΓÇªis from now!
 My role now is to stall this person as long as possibleΓÇª
 So, I shouldΓÇÖve avoided a big technique that could be self-defeatingΓÇª
 But it seems this isnΓÇÖt an opponent easy enough to be able to beat
 without using my Secret TechniqueΓÇª
 Here I go!
 I just had surgery and am not at my best.
 But if itΓÇÖd just be opening the first of the Eight Inner Gates, The Gate of Opening,
 I should somehowΓÇª
 The first gateΓÇª Gate of OpeningΓÇª
 Open!
 Primary Lotus!
 The impact of the kick was suppressed by the bonesΓÇª?!
 ThatΓÇÖs some speedΓÇª But itΓÇÖs over.
 Damn itΓÇª No matter how much I think, I canΓÇÖt come up with any good strategies!
 IΓÇÖve had itΓÇªcanΓÇÖt hold any furtherΓÇª
 With me right in front of you, you canΓÇÖt even howl like a loserΓÇª?
 Eh?!
 Die!
 YouΓÇÖre mine!
 DonΓÇÖt you be smiling before youΓÇÖre going to die!
 What?!
 WhoΓÇÖre you?!
 HehΓÇª It seems youΓÇÖre an ally this timeΓÇª
 WhoΓÇÖre you?!
 A SandΓÇª
 ShinobiΓÇª
 ally of the Leaf!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I heard that the Sand and Leaf had made up, butΓÇª
 It wasnΓÇÖt that we attacked the Leaf Village for the fun of it.
 It was just a mission, same as this time.
 Humph! I see.
 By the way, werenΓÇÖt you three headed this way together?
 We had no choice. Since you guys are weakΓÇª
 Idiot. DonΓÇÖt take them lightly. These guys are out of the ordinary.

27,"Press down hard on the gas
 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 I like your determination!
 ThenΓÇª
 For those who are still hereΓÇª
 The first test...
 you have passed it!
 YouΓÇÖve passed through the gates!
 The first test for the Chunin Exams has been completedΓÇª
 I wish you well.
 All right! Wish us well!
 What a funny guyΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt think that there would be a guy who would pass the first test
 with a blank test sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki. He really is a funny guy.
 The Chunin Exam Stage 2: The Forest of Death!
 ThereΓÇÖs something kind of creepy about this place.
 This place is called the Forest of Death, youΓÇÖll soon realize why.
 ΓÇ£The Forest of Death, youΓÇÖll soon realize why.ΓÇ¥
 That kind of threat wonΓÇÖt work on me one bit!
 IΓÇÖm not scared!
 Really?
 YouΓÇÖve got a lot of energy.
 A kid like you dies at very beginning,
 dappled with the red blood I like.
 IΓÇÖm returning yourΓÇªKunai KnifeΓÇª
 Thank you for taking the troubleΓÇª
 ButΓÇªdonΓÇÖt stand behind me, thirsty for blood.
 If you donΓÇÖt want a quick deathΓÇª
 Well, itΓÇÖs my nature to act up at the sight of red blood.
 And my precious hair was cut, so I got excitedΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 W-What with that Proctor?
 Frankly, sheΓÇÖs psycho!
 This one, tooΓÇª
 That girl, why was her tongue so long?
 Evidently, weΓÇÖve got a lot of hot-blooded kids this time.
 This will be fun.
 YouΓÇÖre the most hot-blooded! Believe it!
 Well, before we start the second exam, I have to pass this out to you!
 ItΓÇÖs a consent form,
 before you can take part in the test you have to sign this.
 Why?
 From here on out, corpses are going to come out,
 I have to get your consent to that!
 Or itΓÇÖll be my responsibility.
 Well, IΓÇÖm going to start the explanation for the second exam.
 In a word, the limits of your survival will be challenged.
 Survival, huh? This test is a total pain.
 First, IΓÇÖll give you step-by-step instruction on the terrain of this Training Field.
 Training Field Number 44 is surrounded by 44 locked entrance gates,
 there are rivers and a forest and a tower in the middle.
 ItΓÇÖs about 10 kilometers from the towers to the gateΓÇª
 In this confined area, you will go through a certain survival program.
 The contents of which areΓÇª
 anything goes scroll battle!
 ScrollΓÇª?
 YesΓÇª
 I want you to fight for two scrolls, the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.
 All together 26 teams got through the first test.
 Half of them...
 13 teams get the Heaven scroll, the other half get the Earth Scroll.
 IΓÇÖll hand over one scroll to each team.
 To put it simply,  thatΓÇÖs what youΓÇÖre vying for.
 And the conditions to pass?
 Three of you bring both the Heaven and Earth Scrolls to the tower in the center.
 That means that of the 13 teams, half of them will fail for sureΓÇª
 Except it has to be in time.
 For this second exam, the time limit is 120 hours.
 Do it in exactly five days!
 Five days.
 What do we do about food?
 Be self-sufficient! ItΓÇÖs a treasure trove in the wilderness.
 ThereΓÇÖs more than enough for foodΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs teeming with fierce people-eating animals,
 poison bugs, poisonous weeds and much more.
 No wayΓÇª
 Fool, thatΓÇÖs why itΓÇÖs called survival!
 Besides, itΓÇÖs improbable that 39 people, 13 teams will pass.
 The interval for activity gets longer with passing each day,
 while the time for recovery gets shorterΓÇª
 Seems pretty grueling!
 On top of that, youΓÇÖre surrounded by nothing but enemies,
 even falling asleep will be a problemΓÇª
 And, besides those injured during attempts to capture scrollsΓÇª
 there will definitely be people
 are unable to endure the rigors of the course.
 UmmΓÇªso you can quit in the middle of it?
 According to the rules, you cannot give up in the middle of it!
 I want you to spend five days in the forest.
 Just like I thoughtΓÇª
 This is going to be a pain!
 Moving on, conditions of disqualification.
 Number 1, if all three members of the team canΓÇÖt make it to the tower
 with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls within the time limit.
 Number 2, if a team loses a member or if a member became incapacitated.
 ThereΓÇÖs that, and this is a supplementΓÇª
 Absolutely do not look at the contents of the scrolls
 until you have reached the tower!
 W-What happens if we look at it halfway through?
 When you look at it youΓÇÖll findΓÇªout!
 Huh?
 There are times when a Chunin must deal with super-secret text.
 This is to test your reliability.
 ThatΓÇÖs all the explanation!
 IΓÇÖll exchange your three consent forms for the scrolls in that hut over there.
 After that, pick your entrance, and all the gates will open simultaneously!
 Finally, just a word of adviceΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt die!
 I see, so you wonΓÇÖt know which scroll was given to each teamΓÇª
 and you wonΓÇÖt know which of the three people is carrying the scroll.
 If what Ibiki said was right,
 there will be life or death struggles for information in this test.
 Everyone is an enemy!
 The resolve of everyone here is strong.
 That means that it might come to killing each other.
 It looks like they understand the meaning of the consent form a little bitΓÇª
 Heeey, look whoΓÇÖs here!
 ItΓÇÖs Billboard Brow, isnΓÇÖt it?
 I thought you went home long ago, I never imagined you were still here.
 Ooooh? Look whoΓÇÖs here, the ugly Inopig.
 Starting now, it's five days of the survival test with Sasuke.
 ThereΓÇÖs no reason to go home.
 ΓÇô Ugly! 					ΓÇô Billboard!
 ΓÇô Ugly! Ugly! ΓÇô Billboard! Billboard!
 ΓÇô Ugly, ugly, ugly! ΓÇô Billboard, billboard, billboard!
 ΓÇô Billboard, billboard, billboard! ΓÇô Ugly ugly ugly!
 ΓÇô Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly! ΓÇô Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!
 Sakura, this is impossible for you.
 For your own sake, just hurry up and go home!
 I could say the exact same thing to you!
 Hey, why are those two on such bad terms?
 D-Do you think I care about something stupid like that?
 ManΓÇªall there is to do is write my name,
 why does it take this much time!
 Hey! Hinata! What are you doing over there?
 N-NarutoΓÇª
 UmmΓÇªuhhhhΓÇªwellΓÇª
 Just like I thought, this kid is strange.
 A scratchΓÇª
 Uh-umΓÇª thisΓÇªis--
 See ya!
 NarutoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs about time for the scroll exchange.
 Well, I wonder how many teams will surviveΓÇª
 Teams who have taken the scroll,
 stay with the representative and move to the gate!
 WeΓÇÖll all start simultaneously in 30 minutes!!
 Yeah! Survival is our forte!
 Hinata, donΓÇÖt show your weakness.
 Uh, okayΓÇª
 Life or deathΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a pain but we just have to do this.
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, Naruto will be our target.
 For snacks, thereΓÇÖs potato chips...
 ΓÇô What about shortcake...? ΓÇô I canΓÇÖt believe you two!
 Okaaaay! I wonΓÇÖt lose!
 IΓÇÖll bring down whoever comes near me.
 ΓÇô Yes! 					ΓÇô Cha!
 Heh hehΓÇªfinally the opportunity is hereΓÇª
 We have the chance to fulfill our mission in earnestΓÇª
 Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,
 IΓÇÖm really scared of spending five days with this guy.
 Target the rookies first.
 They said that from now on itΓÇÖs okay to kill,
 which makes it easier.
 Master Guy, IΓÇÖll do my best! IΓÇÖll definitely succeed!
 We now start the second test of the Chunin Exam!
 Look for the brats!
 Those three, right?
 All right! LetΓÇÖs go!
 Okay! First, we search for that thing.
 Can you do it, Hinata?
 Yes.
 Byakugan!
 Slow down, Lee! We just started.
 I know. ButΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt stay still!
 Who knows what kind of powerful foe is waiting for us.
 Hot-blooded foolΓÇª
 As you already understand, we have only one target!
 W-What are you doing, Choji?
 Just a little breakΓÇª IΓÇÖm already tired, and hungryΓÇª
 What are you suddenly saying?!
 It hasnΓÇÖt been five minutes since we started!
 But I canΓÇÖt help it. IΓÇÖm hungryΓÇª
 You! If you were able to bring snacks,
 you should have been able to bring one Kunai knife!
 Ino! Hide!
 Uh-oh!
 This kind of thing continuing  for five daysΓÇª?
 Anyway, the tower is the goal for everyone, right?
 So it would be clever for us to make a trap in the vicinity of the tower.
 OkayΓÇªwasting no time, huh?
 Where are they?
 HehΓÇªkids.
 ItΓÇÖs like begging to be found, standing in that conspicuous place.
 They sensed our presence,
 but, evidently they havenΓÇÖt grasped where we are.
 What happened? 					YouΓÇÖre pale.
 W-What is that?!
 The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village sense body temperature and perspiration,
 then in mass, swoop down on their prey.
 If they continue to suck your blood for five minutes,
 you go to the other worldΓÇª
 Using this behavior,
 weΓÇÖd set a trap on the path enemies would use to escape.
 D-Darn itΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs one team gone!
 It sounds like theyΓÇÖve already started.
 Wasn't that someone screaming just now?
 I-IΓÇÖm kinda getting nervous.
 I-It was nothing. Sakura. Believe it!
 I-I have to peeΓÇª
 Y-YouΓÇªfool!
 What are you doing in front of a lady!
 Go to the grass!
 Aaah, that was a lot! IΓÇÖm refreshed.
 Like I said, not in front of a lady--!
 S-SasukeΓÇª no matter what, you donΓÇÖt have to go that far.
 W-What was that forΓÇª?
 What are you doingΓÇªall of a sudden?!
 What you ask? ThatΓÇÖs my line, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Sasuke!
 It canΓÇÖt be helped!
 Sasuke, please stop!
 Look closely at him!
 Talk! WhereΓÇÖs the real Naruto!
 I have no idea what youΓÇÖre talking about!
 What happened to the scratch on you face?
 IΓÇÖm asking what happened to the scratch you got before from the Proctor!
 And your Shuriken holster is on your left leg.
 That guyΓÇÖs right handed!
 YouΓÇÖre worse at transformation than Naruto, you phony!
 Unlucky! You got me. ln that caseΓÇª
 Which one of you got the scroll?
 If you listen to me obediently, IΓÇÖll spare your lives.
 I see! Then IΓÇÖll resort to force!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Aww, stupid gas mask man!
 Suddenly sneaking up on someone when they're peeing!
 I messed up just a little bit.
 Now I have to hurry and meet up with Sakura.
 Wait a minute! What is this giant snake?
 Hey! Are you serious?! Wait a minute, hey!
 I've been gulped down!

 Just like the Uchiha loser earlier,
 why is it that each and every Leaf Village Ninja is an idiot?
 Shut up!

 Are you seriously thinking theyΓÇÖre alive after falling off this cliff?
 You shouldΓÇÖve gotten out of here.

 What?!

 What?!

 SasukeΓÇÖs okay, too.
 IΓÇÖm coming to save you now, believe it.
 Idiot. Forget about us and get going to the finish line, quick!
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs right.
 But what should we do about this?
 Leave it to me.
 WeΓÇÖll cut the rope and go to the opposite bank in one swing!
 I get it!
 I thought the worst of myself.
 But Boss Jirocho trusted in me.
 I trust you more than anyone.
 It was the first time I was trusted by someone.
 So I wanted to win this race for the boss, no matter what.
 But in reality, I canΓÇÖt win just with such feelings.
 So many times along the way, I felt like giving up.
 Watch out!
 But each time,
 you guys risked your lives to save a lame duck like me!
 Naruto, IΓÇÖm sorry.
 I shouldΓÇÖve trusted you guys from the start.
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?
 Say stuff like that after winning the race.
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 Naruto!
 Idate!
 Okay, do it!
 Right!
 Boo! Boo! Boo!
 Now that's a rousing welcome.
 Naruto, at this rate, weΓÇÖll crash into the rocks!
 I know. Leave it to me!
 Release Chakra from the bottom of my feet.
 ItΓÇÖs the very last Chakra!
 Then stick to the rocks with Chakra!
 All right, Naruto!
 Now dash to the finish line!
 Sakura, IΓÇÖll come back to help you right away!
 Okay. LetΓÇÖs go, Idate.
 Right!
 Run steady, Fukusuke!

 I wonΓÇÖt give up until the very end!

 I really want to apologize now. IΓÇÖm truly sorry!

 Well done, Idate.
 I was wrong about you.
 Okay, Idate. Go receive the winnerΓÇÖs blessing.

 Along the way, he rode on the back of a hired Ninja.
 This is a violation.
 W-What?
 ThereΓÇÖs proof.
 Look at this photo.
 Racing until the end on your own strength is the rule of this race.
 Therefore, Idate is disqualified.
 The winner is Fukusuke Hikyakuya of the Wagarashi Family.
 No way.
 H-Hold it. That wasΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖll hear no excuses! Jirocho, itΓÇÖs a promise.
 I order the Wasabi Family dissolved immediately.
 Just a minute.
 There is no such rule anywhere. Do not speak nonsense!
 M-My lord!
 Or perhapsΓÇª
 you have a reason for wanting the Wagarashi to win at all cost?
 No, nothing like that.
 Could it be because you would not be able to do things like this?
 Look.
 You fool! Retire and enter the monastery!
 Yes, yes, my lord!
 Kyuroku Wagarashi.
 Y-Yes?
 Word of your evil deeds has reached my ears as well.
 Your sins against the people of Degarashi Port are severe.
 Therefore, the Wagarashi Family is to be dissolved as of today.
 Understood?
 Y-Yes, sire.
 Today is an auspicious day.
 With this, the matter is settled.
 Thanks for the help, Naruto.
 Idate, this is good-bye, huh?
 IΓÇÖve come to get the wounded.
 Ibiki.
 B-Big Brother!
 Where are the wounded?
 Over here.
 Okay, get him on the boat, quickly.
 R-Right.
 Um, excuse me.
 What is it?
 N-Nothing.
 Brother!
 Wait, Big Brother!
 Who are you?
 The man who called me Big Brother died three years ago.
 Big BrotherΓÇª I figured out the answer to the tenth problem!
 IΓÇÖll never betray a comrade again!
 I can trust others now!
 He's looking good now.
 'Bye, Idate. LetΓÇÖs meet again.
 Good-bye. See you around.
 Yeah. You guys come again, too, okay?
 I wish you good health, Boss!
 YeahΓÇª
 See ya!
 Take care!
 An interesting guy as always.
 No wonder the Fifth Hokage sees potential in him.
 Naruto! Thanks!
 Idate! Next time, itΓÇÖll be a battle with me, believe it.
 Sasuke, does it hurt?
 No.
 Thank goodness.
 Those wounds will heal immediately once we get back to the village.
 Right.
 The rumors were true.
 The survivor of the villageΓÇÖs honorable Uchiha ClanΓÇª
 is just a good-for-nothing kidΓÇª
 I couldnΓÇÖt beat him!
 And yet, heΓÇª
 that Naruto...!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Hey Sasuke and Naruto, what's happened to both of you?
 This is a hospital, and Sasuke's still recuperating!
 Even you should know better, Naruto.
 Stop the antics already!
 Why, why's this happening?!

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Reunion: The Remaining Time
 WhatΓÇÖs going to happen?!
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal?!
 SumaruΓÇÖs mom is being pressed back!
 My star training is done my own way.
 It shouldnΓÇÖt be a match
 for one who has completed proper star training like you.
 But whatΓÇÖs with that sorry stateΓÇª?
 I canΓÇÖt feel even a smidgeon of the power from before.
 Sure enough, youΓÇÖve also got side-effects from the star trainingΓÇª
 Even if this life should endΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll never forgive you!
 Lord Akahoshi!
 What?
 You be a good boy!
 ItΓÇÖs a simple mission.
 WeΓÇÖll be able to come back home right away.
 Right! Have a safe journey.
 Mother!
 Mother!
 Mother!
 SumaruΓÇª!
 Mother!
 Sumaru!
 Oh, no!
 Lord Akahoshi. Why would you do such a thing?
 Is it true thenΓÇª?
 Give it backΓÇª
 Hold it!
 Farewell.
 Wh-What?
 Then it was Lord Akahoshi
 who knocked everyone out and took Sumaru away?
 A sensei who does something like that
 to students who believe in him is unforgivable!
 Why in the worldΓÇª? Why would you do such a thing?
 ItΓÇÖs all for the sake of the villageΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs for the sake of taking back the star she stole!
 Even if that were the case,
 that doesnΓÇÖt make for a reason to cause Sumaru pain!
 That person is SumaruΓÇÖs mom!
 M-MyΓÇªmotherΓÇª
 Exactly!
 However, even if she is your mother, sheΓÇÖs now your enemy!
 The person before you is the woman who stole the star
 and attempted to bring about the doom to our village!
 ThatΓÇÖs wrong!
 SumaruΓÇÖs mom just hid the star
 in order to save everyone from the pain of the training!
 Foolishness! Being able to die for the sake of the village
 is a ShinobiΓÇÖs long-cherished dream!
 IsnΓÇÖt that right, Sumaru?!
 YouΓÇÖre going to become the Hoshikage and put to shame
 the Five Great Hidden Villages that treated us with contempt, right?
 YesΓÇª I want to become the Hoshikage and put them to shameΓÇª
 Show your foolish mother your determination!
 YesΓÇª I can die if itΓÇÖs for the sake of the village.
 Sumaru!
 DonΓÇÖt do anything stupid, Sumaru!
 His Chakra is in synch with AkahoshiΓÇÖs.
 Sumaru is being controlled!
 What?!
 ExactlyΓÇª I have SumaruΓÇÖs life in the palm of my hand.
 Lady Natsuhi.
 I shall give you the ultimate choice!
 Will you take the star?
 OrΓÇªyour sonΓÇÖs life?
 Wait!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Lady Natsuhi?
 Have you realized your own foolishness?
 LadyΓÇª
 You win, Akahoshi.
 Sumaru!
 You did it!
 Excellent. How did you get it?
 Simple, Lady Natsuhi returned it with good grace.
 Lady!
 ThatΓÇÖs dirty!
 Sumaru!
 SumaruΓÇª
 Is that personΓÇªreallyΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ΓÇô YouΓÇª! I wonΓÇÖt forgive you! ΓÇô YouΓÇª! I wonΓÇÖt forgive you!
 Hidden Leaf Shinobi, IΓÇÖm your employer.
 ΓÇô That doesnΓÇÖt make any difference! ΓÇô That doesnΓÇÖt make any difference!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Neji!
 Why, Neji? I canΓÇÖt stand this either.
 No! From here on is an issue for the Hidden Star.
 ItΓÇÖs none of our concern!
 That being said, are we just going to leave them be?
 Anything further would be beyond the scope of the missionΓÇª
 The Leaf must not betray the client of the accepted mission, right?
 Damn it!
 Oh well.
 The star has returned. IΓÇÖll overlook everyoneΓÇÖs actions today.
 Those who wish to continue to live for the sake of the village, come with meΓÇª
 B-ButΓÇªSumaru isΓÇª
 Forsake the son of the traitor.
 Pull out!
 Yes, my lord!
 IΓÇÖm sorry. I must not leave Sumaru behind.
 Rogue Ninja!
 Hokuto! YouΓÇÖll regret this!
 Well, do as you like!
 That jerkΓÇª!
 Hey, lookΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs called Natsuboshi.
 ItΓÇÖs the other name for the planet Mars, right?
 It seems itΓÇÖs the same name as SumaruΓÇÖs momΓÇª
 Sumaru thinks that star is protecting him.
 I bet Lady Natsuhi was also looking at that star.
 IΓÇÖm moved.
 The hearts of parent and child are connected!
 YeahΓÇª
 HowΓÇÖre the two doing?
 TheyΓÇÖre resting comfortably nowΓÇª
 But Akahoshi attack the mother took
 when her body was weakened from the effects of the star is a fatal one.
 Her Chakra Network is in shreds and it will mean certain death
 if she uses that Jutsu even one more timeΓÇª
 Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade couldΓÇª
 Who knowsΓÇª?
 Damn it! That Akahoshi jerk is unforgivable!
 IΓÇÖll kick his butt!
 NarutoΓÇª! You still donΓÇÖt get it?
 But heΓÇÖs a huge scoundrel.
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 The Leaf would lose credibility
 if we do something like betraying a client.
 But we canΓÇÖt leave things be, right?
 Well, I also understand what NejiΓÇÖs saying.
 We must ask the Lady Hokage for instructions.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Anyway, letΓÇÖs take those two to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 YeahΓÇª The Hidden Star matter will come after that.
 Sumaru.
 Mother!
 Mother.
 YouΓÇÖre probably angry, arenΓÇÖt you, SumaruΓÇª?
 Of course, you would resent meΓÇª who abandoned the village
 and went so far as to entrust you to someone else.
 How often I attempted to take you with meΓÇª
 But I kept telling myself that
 I couldnΓÇÖt make you happy since I had become a Rogue NinjaΓÇª
 with this body that could give out at any time
 due to the star training.
 Stay away!
 I often had the same dream.
 A dream where I chase after you two, crying.
 Sumaru.
 Mother!
 I kept telling myself
 that my mother was not a cold-hearted person
 who would leave me behindΓÇª
 You had died.
 Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said.
 He said you had been killed by a Ninja from some other land,
 died and turned into a starΓÇª
 He said you had turned into the NatsuhiboshiΓÇª!
 SumaruΓÇª
 Mother!
 Even soΓÇª
 Even soΓÇªI wanted you to take me with you.
 SumaruΓÇª
 I was lonesomeΓÇª MotherΓÇª
 Natsuboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
 Swollen as I criedΓÇª
 Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
 I'm searching for a child who has gone afar
 He can't be found. though I search all day
 My sad dreams come once more
 Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru!
 WhereΓÇÖs the lady? Your mom.
 Hey, whereΓÇÖd she go?
 What?!
 This is badΓÇª
 Mother!
 Even if it costs my life, I canΓÇÖt let that star beΓÇª
 There mustnΓÇÖt be any more sad mothers and children!
 CanΓÇÖt let it happen. lf she gets recklessΓÇª
 and ends up using that Jutsu againΓÇª
 It became the villageΓÇÖs power and protected the village.
 I didnΓÇÖt want to have to destroy itΓÇª
 But star, you have caused pain and suffering
 to one too many of the childrenΓÇª
 Forgive meΓÇª
 AkahoshiΓÇª
 Ninja Art: Kujaku
 Beast!
 SumaruΓÇª
 So your strength has given out? How tragic.
 MotherΓÇª
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs the matter?
 It couldnΓÇÖt be! Lady Natsuhi isΓÇª
 Mother died!
 As of this moment,
 I, Akahoshi, shall bear the name of Fourth Hoshikage!
 I shall announce the first mission as Hoshikage.
 The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto,
 and the Hidden Leaf Shinobi are enemies who demean us!
 If you find them attempting to enter the village,
 bring them down immediately!
 Yes, my lord!
 I willΓÇª
 I will get the one who killed my mother!
 Sumaru!
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Damn that Akahoshi jerk! I canΓÇÖt forgive him anymore.
 HeΓÇÖs diabolical.
 Hey, you two!
 IΓÇÖll pound him with a good one.
 Forget it. DonΓÇÖt stick your nose into their internal affairs.
 Then, IΓÇÖll beat him into shape with my Lotus.
 ThatΓÇÖd be the same as Naruto.
 Then whatΓÇÖre you saying we do?
 Anyway, IΓÇÖm going, so.
 IΓÇÖll go with you.
 No. Do you guys want to start a war with the Hidden Star?

 That markΓÇª
 I saw the same one on the guys  that attacked this village!
 ThatΓÇÖs a lie!
 ItΓÇÖs not a lie! This markΓÇª
 Same from that nightΓÇª
 N-No! Spare me!
 Stop!
 This is the same mark from that time.
 No way!
 But this wasnΓÇÖt in the medical teamΓÇÖs report.
 Byakugan!
 It seems this is a particular mark that only emerges
 when he sweatsΓÇª
 You guys get out!
 Why?
 IΓÇÖm going to take care of him.
 Say what?! I wonΓÇÖt let you do that!
 Why do you protect him? ls the Leaf Village also in cahoots?
 No, thatΓÇÖs not it!
 He doesnΓÇÖt remember a thing from the pastΓÇª
 He has no memory.
 No memory?
 ItΓÇÖs memory loss. We came in search of his memory.
 Then you should know now. HeΓÇÖs a dirty bandit!
 Whether or not he has a memory makes no difference to me!
 Calm down!
 It would only be in vain  to kill someone
 who has no memory of  committing a crime.
 Shut up!
 If you really want to have your revenge,
 do so as much as you like after getting his memory backΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt stop you at that time.
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do that even if he gets his memory back!
 ItΓÇÖs as Neji says.
 WeΓÇÖll also find out the identity of the guys who attacked
 if his memory returns and we get him to talk.
 We might be able to save the village if we can use him to cut a dealΓÇª
 We have to keep him alive now. We wonΓÇÖt run away or hide!
 Keep quietΓÇª He wonΓÇÖt let Menma live unless we tell him this.
 IΓÇÖm going to sew up the wound. Hold his arms and legs.
 That girl isΓÇª
 I just canΓÇÖt believe it. HeΓÇÖs the embodiment of good natureΓÇª
 To think heΓÇÖd be a comrade of the bandits.
 I wonder if he became a good guy  after losing his memory.
 He just has the same mark as those guys due to some sort of circumstance.
 Even if he lost his memory,
 he wouldnΓÇÖt become this good-natured of a guy if he was a bad person.
 Either way, weΓÇÖll know everything  if he get his memory back.
 I wasΓÇªa comrade of the bandits, wasnΓÇÖt I?
 You heard us talking earlier?
 DonΓÇÖt worry about it. We donΓÇÖt know any of the details. Okay?
 Heal that wound for nowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going to have a look around the area.

 Your friends and that guy will die  if you try anything funny.
 Do as you like when that happens.

 TentenΓÇª!
 Why did you let him out of the hut?!
 Sorry. I dozed offΓÇª
 I got careless thinking  he couldnΓÇÖt moveΓÇª
 Guys, stop! He has no memory!
 So he doesnΓÇÖt even know if  heΓÇÖs one of their comrades or notΓÇª!
 We warned you before!
 You guys are just as much to blame if you protect him any further!
 Get them!
 Stop it!
 We should get away for now!
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªfineΓÇª
 What?
 Of course, everyoneΓÇÖs angry. IΓÇªshould be punished.

 The Paralysis is released.

 Here they come!
 IΓÇÖll leave those guys to you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ItΓÇÖs futile!
 Heh, whatΓÇÖs the matter? Finished already?!
 I donΓÇÖt even have a scratch on meΓÇª
 This is what I was after!
 Wha--?!
 WhatΓÇÖs happening? IΓÇÖm getting an amazing power.
 Here I go!
 Rotation!
 Now, prepare yourself!
 You wonΓÇÖt get away!

 This is precious to you, right?

 You jerk!
 Your voiceΓÇª ItΓÇÖs back!
 Th-Thank youΓÇª
 Now, letΓÇÖs go back to the others.
 Right.
 Menma! You okay?
 YeahΓÇª
 We took care of most of them!
 What about their leader? What about Shiin?!
 I chased after him,  but he got awayΓÇª
 This is badΓÇª
 Now that Shiin knows the villagers wonΓÇÖt abandon their homes and get out,
 heΓÇÖll use his last resort.
 There is a dam built upriver to secure water resources during a drought.
 There is enough water for the village  to last a year, even if it doesnΓÇÖt rain.
 The dam has been rigged to blow up
 and to sweep away the entire village with a flood.
 All they care about is the mine.
 We canΓÇÖt stop something like a flood
 unless we move mountains or something!
 MountainsΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs it. We should move mountains!
 Naruto! Take me to the mine.
 Wha--?
 There should be a bunch of Letter Bombs in the mine!
 Letter Bombs?! WhatΓÇÖre you going to do with those?!
 IΓÇÖm going to blow up  the mine itself.
 The crumbled dirt and sand will  fill up the valley
 and the flood can be stopped.
 Damn it! HeΓÇÖs started! LetΓÇÖs hurry, Menma!
 NarutoΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs something  I have to tell you.
 Make it later!
 I havenΓÇÖt lost my memory.
 YeahΓÇª But stopping the flood comes first!
 No, IΓÇÖd like you to listen now.
 I lost my parents when I was little and was raised in ShiinΓÇÖs clan.
 They were a small Shinobi clan even in the Land of Rice Paddies.
 But they still had ambitious plansΓÇª
 However, a Shinobi village was created  in the Land of Rice Paddies
 about a year ago.
 It was the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 The Village Hidden in the Sound!
 Clan members confident in their skill
 drifted over to Hidden Sound Village  one after another.
 Eventually jobs from the feudal lord stopped coming.
 Shiin the leader of the clan that had lost its means of livelihood
 set his eyes on the mine in this villageΓÇª
 The plan was to just threaten and chase off the villagers.
 But I encountered unexpected resistance,
 and I got scared and tried to escapeΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you hesitating for?  Hurry up and take care of him.
 Father! Father!
 Stop it!
 YouΓÇª You jerk!
 Look out!
 IΓÇÖm a member of a clan that has committed crimes.
 It wouldΓÇÖve been better if IΓÇÖd just died like thatΓÇª
 How easy things wouldΓÇÖve been  if I couldΓÇÖve died thenΓÇª
 I got scared thinking about  the villagers who diedΓÇª
 I wanted to forget.
 And so I cowardly escaped into a Jutsu passed down through the clan
 that erases memory.
 However, the Jutsu didnΓÇÖt work  very wellΓÇª
 I only temporarily lost my memory and it came back in a few hours.
 Then you had your memory  the whole time?!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Knock it off!
 Then why didnΓÇÖt you tell me about that honestly from the start?!
 If you had, it wouldΓÇÖve beenΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt have the courage to make the crimes of the clan public.
 But I thought the clan must not commit any further crimes.
 So I pretended to lose my memory.
 And to prevent the clan from adding to their crimesΓÇª
 I wanted to bring some of you  Leaf Shinobi here
 and have you help out.
 I knew of ShiinΓÇÖs next plan.
 There must not be any  more village casualties.
 Stopping that is my duty for having survived.
 DutyΓÇª?
 I needed the help of the Leaf Shinobi
 before Shiin could execute his next planΓÇª
 I wanted to round them all up  during the attack earlier.
 But since things have come this far, IΓÇÖll stop the flood.
 Thanks, NarutoΓÇª
 I leave Shiin to you. Find and stop him, no matter what.
 YouΓÇª ThisΓÇª?
 This is goodbye.
 Somebody has to blow up the Letter Bombs insideΓÇª
 If you do that, youΓÇÖllΓÇª!
 Thanks to you, my life has  taken on more meaningΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs that sound?
 There are intermittent explosions occurring upriverΓÇª
 The village will be engulfed in a mudslide if the dam breaks!
 NoΓÇª!
 NejiΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs coming!
 GoodbyeΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 Menma!
 Wh-What happenedΓÇª?
 It seems the crumbled mountain  stopped the mudslideΓÇª
 Then, that means the village is saved?
 YeahΓÇª
 ΓÇô Thank goodness! ΓÇô ThatΓÇÖs a reliefΓÇª
 H-How can that be?!
 Menma!!
 That jerkΓÇª!
 He wonΓÇÖt get away! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hold it!
 Interfering with our plan!
 You think such a Jutsu will work  on meΓÇª Huh?!
 Die!
 IΓÇÖll stop you in MenmaΓÇÖs place!
 What?!
 Rasengan!
 He sacrificed his life to save  the village, huhΓÇª?
 No matter what his past was, he was a good guy at heartΓÇª
 MisterΓÇª
 I wanted to say a word of apology.
 Not being able to remember anything until the end
 might have been salvation for himΓÇª
 It was a promise, right? To eat this with you.
 You donΓÇÖt need to say anything to him?
 HeΓÇÖll be fine if he has an appetite. I know how he is.
 HeΓÇÖll overcome it on his own as time passes.
 For a while heΓÇÖll probably remember each time he eats ramenΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs fine.
 People can get stronger precisely because
 they have feelings that are never forgottenΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs whatΓÇÖs called growth.
 DamnΓÇª This is good!
 MenmaΓÇª
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling

 The Village Hidden in the Sand requested an auxiliary force?
 Ones who call themselves the Four Celestials
 took one of Sand VillageΓÇÖs Ninja  candidates as a hostage
 and escaped towards the Land of Fire.
 Presently, Gaara and others are chasing them.
 That means an ambush, doesnΓÇÖt it?

 But the Village Hidden in the Stars is a Shinobi village, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Then they should do their own protecting
 without asking others.
 There are often instances of a small village
 with friendly relations seeking cooperation.
 In particular, that village is small
 and it seems there arenΓÇÖt that many Shinobi.
 No kidding. But whyΓÇÖs a place like that being targeted?
 ActuallyΓÇª!
 It all happened 200 years ago.
 A star fell in the village!
 Those stars like in the sky, not ninja stars or something?!
 Right! It seems thereΓÇÖs a mysterious power in the star
 that has an effect on Chakra!
 ThatΓÇÖs a superstition!
 In the first place, no way has a star ever come falling down!
 ItΓÇÖs true!
 ItΓÇÖs actually been targeted several times until now
 by Shinobi of other lands.
 By Shinobi of other lands?
 Mysterious power, huh?
 Indeed, it does seem that someone like Orochimaru would target itΓÇª
 All right, I guess IΓÇÖll be participating in this one too!
 What?! But the three-man teamΓÇÖs already been determined.
 IΓÇÖve got an ace up my sleeveΓÇª
 Amaguriama Sweet Shop
 Listen up. IΓÇÖll take the lead from here.
 ThereΓÇÖs danger before entering the village.
 Okay, got it!
 Hi, guys!
 IΓÇÖll go on ahead and be waiting!
 Naruto! Hold it!
 That idiot!
 Umm, whatΓÇÖs Naruto doing in a place like this?
 Like I know.
 Lady Tsunade, there was a report
 that Naruto has joined up with NejiΓÇÖs squad.
 Yes. I added him to the Village Hidden in the Stars mission.
 WhyΓÇª?!
 Those four proved themselves in the Katabami Gold MineΓÇª
 and things will quiet down in the village here, too.
 YouΓÇÖd change an already determined three-man squad just for that reason?!
 Lady Tsunade?!
 Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly with gold leaf candy from Amaguriama?
 Could it be that was from NarutoΓÇª? 70.01	01:06:50:29	01:06:52:26	Tea! Hurry!
 Mizura!
 You okay?!
 IΓÇÖm fineΓÇª
 I told you not to push yourself!
 But, I donΓÇÖt want to fall behind everyoneΓÇÖs trainingΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing during your training?!
 Mizura suddenly keeled over in painΓÇª
 Take him to the medical treatment room.
 Yes sir.
 IΓÇÖll go, too.
 Hokuto by herself is enough for an escort.
 Sumaru, you have a mission.
 All right! IΓÇÖm here first!
 Once I cross this valley, IΓÇÖll be in the Land of Bears.
 The Village Hidden in the Stars is close.
 Wha--?!
 You littleΓÇª!
 Ninja Art: KujakuΓÇª
 Protection!
 This guy blocked Kunai knives with Chakra!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Cut!
 Damn it!
 Incredible Chakra!
 Wait!
 This guyΓÇÖs an enemyΓÇª He suddenly attacked!
 YouΓÇÖre Leaf Shinobi, right?
 Are you from the Village Hidden in the Stars?
 IΓÇÖm Sumaru. I came to pick you guys up.
 Then why did you do such a thingΓÇª?
 Look at that.
 Huh?
 The border of the Land of Bears is constantly filled with poison gas.
 ItΓÇÖs also serves as a natural fortress
 against invasion from other lands.
 So this is the danger you were talking about, huh?
 IsnΓÇÖt that great, Naruto? You owe Sumaru your life!
 ItΓÇÖs the beginning of a beautiful friendship
 between the Leaf and the Hidden Star Village.
 Give me a break.
 Was it none of my concern?
 I could have just watched and not done anythingΓÇª
 I am Akahoshi
 and I serve as the deputy Hoshikage of the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 DeputyΓÇªHoshikage?
 Due to the sudden passing of the Third Hoshikage one year ago,
 presently there is no Hoshikage in this villageΓÇª
 But, I heard the only ones who can refer to themselves as a Kage
 are the leaders of the Five Great Hidden VillagesΓÇª
 That doesnΓÇÖt make any difference!
 We are not inferior to you guys!
 Even if weΓÇÖre small now, this village will someday rival
 the Hidden Villages of the Five Great Nations!
 At that time, IΓÇÖll become the true Hoshikage!
 Silence!
 Go back to the training ground.
 H-Hey, wait up!
 Oh! Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Now of all times!
 DonΓÇÖt worry about him. Please continue your story.
 Forgive me.
 As  you say, the Shinobi in our village are not qualified
 to refer to themselves as a Kage.
 However, in this village, there is the star
 that all the Kage in the Five Great Hidden Villages also envy.
 We will use the power of the star and someday,
 this can become a village which can claim the Sixth Kage title.
 So that star is being targeted, right?
 Yes. Our search team obtained some information.
 WhereΓÇÖd that guy go?
 Hey!
 I finally caught up. Was your name Omaru?
 Not Omaru, Sumaru.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 But SumaruΓÇÖs sure an interesting name.
 ItΓÇÖs another name for the star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star.
 Everyone in this village has a name associated with stars.
 After all, this is a village where a star fell.
 I seeΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you trying to elicit from me?
 What? Nothing in particular.
 I hadnΓÇÖt thanked you for earlier, so.
 I can tell even if you give me the runaroundΓÇª
 The people from other lands are all after the star.
 If you have that power,
 you can stand above all of the Hidden Villages, soΓÇª
 Is your awesome Chakra also the power of the star?
 If they had that star,
 would everyone have the same Chakra as you?
 No! The more tremendous the power,
 the more hard work is required to control it!
 IΓÇÖll work hard, work hard, work hard!
 IΓÇÖll become the Hoshikage!
 Yeah! I look forward to working with you at that time!
 HuhΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm also going to become the Hokage someday, believe it!
 YouΓÇÖre a strange guy.
 Really?
 Intruder!
 Protect the star!
 But they really are collapsed entirely from the center towards the outside.
 When a star explodes in mid-air, it seems they collapse like this.
 ThatΓÇÖs the training area where the star is enshrined.
 Hurry up and show me the star.
 No. People from other lands aren't allowed beyond this spot.
 But the star is over there, right?
 I canΓÇÖt protect it if I canΓÇÖt get close to it!
 ItΓÇÖs not like we trust you guys.
 Geez, youΓÇÖre such a suspicious guy!
 Why canΓÇÖt you trust us who came here on a mission?!
 This is my personality, you see.
 It canΓÇÖt be?! No way.
 IΓÇÖll chase him down!
 You go to your friends in the training area.
 Hurry!
 Right. Okay.
 Hokuto!
 SumaruΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorry.
 We couldnΓÇÖt protect the starΓÇª
 You little!
 ItΓÇÖs ridiculous to do something like steal in someone elseΓÇÖs village
 in broad daylight, you little thief!
 Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now, I wonΓÇÖt let you getaway!
 Ninja Art: KujakuΓÇª
 This Chakra?!
 Beast!
 Uh, oh! Move away!
 Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsu towards that monster!
 ItΓÇÖs futile!
 This is my real target!
 I found your weak point.
 The main body doesnΓÇÖt move while controlling the Chakra!
 LetΓÇÖs go! Clone Body Slam!
 There are more ways to use my Chakra!
 That one hit hard.
 Synthesis!
 DamnΓÇª
 Naruto!
 Wings!
 You can fly?!
 You let him get away.
 IΓÇÖm sorry. ButΓÇª
 It was my mistake for leaving it to you.
 But as for him, he used the same Ninja Art as you.
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this?!
 Only those who perform the star training
 can use that Ninja ArtΓÇª
 Then youΓÇÖre saying heΓÇÖs someone from this village?
 I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm the one who let him get away.
 IΓÇÖll get the star back, no matter what!
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 IΓÇÖm kind of bothered by the village leaderΓÇÖs attitude.
 That the opponent used the Ninja Art: Kujaku meansΓÇª
 Yeah, the attacker is definitely a Shinobi from this village.
 But, that old man didnΓÇÖt say anything.
 It looks like thereΓÇÖs some kind of secret.
 We need to investigate him. LetΓÇÖs all split up.
 Roger!
 IΓÇÖll get that star back, no matter what.

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 I'm going...
 to become the Hokage.
 I canΓÇÖt lose here!
 You? Hokage?!
 When youΓÇÖre weaker than me?
 IΓÇÖll become... Hokage for you!
 Transform!
 Hey hey, are you serious?
 YouΓÇÖve been here three years
 and you canΓÇÖt even do a respectable transformation?!
 All of you watch now!
 I will absolutely someday become the true and a real Hokage!
 Lame! What Hokage?!
 You know deep down inside that you canΓÇÖt become the Hokage.
 So quit acting tough!
 YouΓÇÖre wrong KibaΓÇª
 If you compete with me for the name of HokageΓÇª
 You... will be the loser!
 Surprise Attack! Naruto's Surprise Weapon!
 Man! Same thing over and over again. You're pesky!
 Well, never mind.
 IΓÇÖll just make it so you wonΓÇÖt stand up again!
 LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru!
 You think you can get me with that same technique again?!
 Take this!
 Darn!
 Fang Over Fang!
 This JutsuΓÇª
 Though, IΓÇÖve seen it beforeΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs not a Jutsu you can dodge over and over!
 What do I do?
 What should I do?!
 Looks like youΓÇÖve got nothing left.
 IΓÇÖve got plenty left!
 Even if you increased yourself by three or four, IΓÇÖd still have a lot left!
 YouΓÇÖve got a comeback for everything!
 LetΓÇÖs finish him with the next! Akamaru!
 Darn!
 I have to counterattack somehow.
 Even if I do, it has to get Kiba or thereΓÇÖs no point!
 But which is whichΓÇª?
 W-What will you do? Naruto!
 NarutoΓÇª
 T-ThatΓÇÖs it!
 Transform!
 YouΓÇÖre mine!
 I see how it isΓÇª
 Huh?
 There, look closely.
 Oh!
 You did it!
 ThatΓÇÖs a clever move, Naruto!
 Naruto!
 If he transforms into Kiba,
 the real Kiba doesnΓÇÖt know which is Akamaru and which is NarutoΓÇª
 He canΓÇÖt attack carelessly.
 However, itΓÇÖs okay for Naruto to attack either one!
 Oooh!
 He created a chance openingΓÇª
 Good work!
 I see, so thatΓÇÖs your moveΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll give you a piece of advice!
 I was careless before and a little late to realize itΓÇª
 But the Transformation Jutsu isnΓÇÖt effective anymore!
 Why, you ask?
 Yeah!
 I can smell you.
 DonΓÇÖt mess with our sense of smell, Naruto.
 By concentrating his Chakra into his nose,
 KibaΓÇÖs sense of smell is enhanced tens of thousands times more than average.
 Of course, he can determine people by their smell too.
 Heh, I won!
 W-What?!
 What's going on?!
 KibaΓÇÖs nose got Naruto and Akamaru mixed up?
 Darn! What in the world is going onΓÇª?!
 Then youΓÇÖre Naruto!
 Messing with me!
 What?!
 Well, this is coming from the original prankster, after allΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs had it!
 He did it!
 NarutoΓÇª Awesome!
 Darn it!
 So thatΓÇÖs itΓÇª
 Naruto, transformed into Kiba,
 was discovered by the real Kiba with smell and hitΓÇª
 But Naruto didnΓÇÖt come back in true Naruto form.
 Instead, he transformed into Akamaru instantly!
 In order to make it look as if it was Akamaru who was hit
 and his impersonation transformation dissolved!
 Was Naruto ever that smartΓÇª?
 You littleΓÇª!
 Think hard about your Jutsu before you use them!
 Because theyΓÇÖll be used against you, stupid!
 HeΓÇÖs using my line, word to wordΓÇª
 Arguing with this guy is only a waste of time!
 DonΓÇÖt go at NarutoΓÇÖs paceΓÇª
 Calm down.
 Calm down!
 He canΓÇÖt actually keep up with my movements yetΓÇª
 I still have the advantage!
 Look closely at NarutoΓÇÖs movements and if thereΓÇÖs an openingΓÇª
 I can surely take him from behind with the All-Four Jutsu.
 Nothing to get flustered aboutΓÇª
 If I do this in a level-headed manner, itΓÇÖs a match I will most certainly win!
 Evidently your enemy has become calmΓÇª
 Well, what will you do, NarutoΓÇª?
 So youΓÇÖve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
 Well then... IΓÇÖll end thisΓÇª
 with my new special technique IΓÇÖve been saving up!
 So youΓÇÖve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
 Well then... IΓÇÖll end thisΓÇª
 with my new special technique IΓÇÖve been saving up!
 What?!
 New special trick?!
 Huh? When did heΓÇª?!
 Leave it to Naruto to hide a new technique!
 What new special technique!
 ThatΓÇÖs obviously a bluff!
 You can test out whether itΓÇÖs a bluff or not!
 This hasnΓÇÖt changed since beforeΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt let his pace get to you.
 Calm down!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 I donΓÇÖt know what kind of technique this is butΓÇª!
 I just wonΓÇÖt let you do it!
 Now!

 Just as I thought, this is as far as he will go.
 Stand up! Naruto!
 D-Darn! I donΓÇÖt even have time to work up my Chakra!
 Hey hey! WhatΓÇÖs wrong?!
 Naruto!
 HeΓÇÖs fast!
 ItΓÇÖs no good.
 He doesnΓÇÖt have time to form hand Signs!
 ThereΓÇÖs too much of a difference in their strengthΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs impossible for Naruto, after all.
 NarutoΓÇª
 D-Darn!
 Take this!
 What?!
 Take that!
 IΓÇÖm going to be Hokage!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose here!
 Whatever! You canΓÇÖt keep up with my speed at all!
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!
 Naruto!
 This is what itΓÇÖs like when I really let it out.
 You understand, donΓÇÖt you?
 To me, youΓÇÖre merelyΓÇª!
 I...
 Huh?
 will absolutely not lose!
 That NarutoΓÇª HeΓÇÖs a fighter.
 Yup.
 If I were Kiba, IΓÇÖd be sick of this already.
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter which anymore, I just wish theyΓÇÖd settle it quickly.
 Naruto...
 Fight!
 Naruto! Use the new technique or whatever!
 Just settle it!
 Naruto! Go for it!

 YouΓÇÖve got spirit, IΓÇÖll give you that!
 HeΓÇÖs close at his endΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll settle it with the next one!
 IΓÇÖll make the new technique explode no matter what!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you!
 YouΓÇÖre slow!
 Take this!
 Oops!
 Fast movements and a keen noseΓÇª
 The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry turned out to be harmfulΓÇª
 Right now KibaΓÇÖs sense of smell is tens of thousands times
 more powerful than normalΓÇª
 WellΓÇª
 That fart was probably a freak accident, butΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what youΓÇÖd expect from the number one unpredictable Ninja.
 Naruto!
 NowΓÇÖs your chance!
 Darn! I was straining too muchΓÇª
 But nowΓÇÖs the time to show my new technique!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!

 Okay! The way youΓÇÖve torn me apart up until now,
 IΓÇÖll give it back all at once!

 Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!

 Well, he was watching SasukeΓÇÖs technique a moment agoΓÇª
 Lion Barrage!
 For the record, the name is a rip off, too.
 The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
 Ohhhh!
 Cha!
 Nice one!
 You did it!
 That Naruto beat Kiba!
 ItΓÇÖs a major upsetΓÇª
 Yup!
 Yes!

 What should I doΓÇª?

 Did you say something?
 Ah, ah, ahΓÇª 					UmmΓÇª
 Huh?
 HinataΓÇª?
 What's this?
 ItΓÇÖs an ointment.
 Why for me?
 Take it for her, Naruto.
 Hmmm. Okay!
 Thank you! YouΓÇÖre nice, Hinata!
 Kiba, itΓÇÖs nothing to be embarrassed about ΓÇª
 This kid was a really strong opponent.
 You are taking this pretty easy, arenΓÇÖt you, Lady HinataΓÇª?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry

 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.

 ThatΓÇÖs a rare Jutsu, isnΓÇÖt it?
 Shizune, have we identified the one who attacked the villagers?
 No, not yetΓÇª
 Menma. IΓÇÖve once heard of a Jutsu similar to yours.
 ΓÇô What?! ΓÇô Is that true, Grandma?!
 I seem to recall that the Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu
 that use musical instruments as the catalysts.
 Land of Rice Paddies? You mean that Land of Rice Paddies?
 Come to think of it,
 the upper part of the mountain stream where Naruto found Menma wasΓÇª
 Land of Rice Paddies?
 Please allow me to go there!
 But infiltrating another land without cause isΓÇª
 No, we do have cause!
 There might be hints there about MenmaΓÇÖs lost memory.
 IΓÇÖd also like to make that request.
 Very well.
 Excellent, Grandma! Now youΓÇÖre talking!
 Thank you.
 Bringing Back Reality
 And so weΓÇÖll be heading out for a bit.
 Right, got it.
 The special pickled bamboo shoots should be ready
 by the time you guys get back.
 I canΓÇÖt wait. Bye!
 Really, thereΓÇÖs no real need for you guys to come.
 We have no choice. ItΓÇÖs a mission.
 Our mission is to accompany you guys!
 Now that itΓÇÖs settledΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs get to the Land of Rice Paddies!
 Right.
 ΓÇô Naruto. 					ΓÇô Huh?
 You stay here.
 Huh?
 What do you want, Grandma?
 If youΓÇÖre any kind of sorry excuse for a Shinobi, you should know.
 What?
 IΓÇÖm talking about Menma. lf that kid is aΓÇª
 No way is he a bad guy.
 I know heΓÇÖs not a bad person.
 But can you state flatly that heΓÇÖs not an enemy spy?
 WhatΓÇÖre you driving at, Grandma?!
 You couldnΓÇÖt have forgotten.
 The Village Hidden in Sound in the Land of Rice Paddies
 is the place where Orochimaru once hid himself.
 Well, IΓÇª
 IΓÇªremember that, butΓÇª
 MenmaΓÇÖs Jutsu is strikingly similar to that of the opponent Shikamaru fought
 when Sasuke was taken away.
 ThereΓÇÖs no denying thereΓÇÖs a chance
 heΓÇÖs affiliated with the Hidden Sound Village.
 And if he remembers something and that was to become a threat to this landΓÇª
 No way could Menma be an enemyΓÇª That just canΓÇÖt be!
 WeΓÇÖll leave you behind if you dawdle!
 Naruto, IΓÇÖm going on ahead!
 Are you hurt?
 NoΓÇª Thanks for the help.
 You were going a bit too fast.
 LetΓÇÖs take a break.
 What the heckΓÇÖs wrong?!
 Who in the world is he?
 WeΓÇÖre going to investigate because we donΓÇÖt know that.
 I was running at full speed earlier.
 Losing my footing on the branch after that was on purpose, thoughΓÇª
 What?
 Not only did he keep up with my speed,
 but he even showed the composure to save me.
 He is better than us in terms of speed.
 HeΓÇÖd be a troublesome opponent if we end up fighting.
 Wha--? Hey, hey, wait a minute.
 HeΓÇÖs not an enemy!
 He risks his life to rescue babies.
 And heΓÇÖs the kind of guy who, if left on his own,
 would help those in trouble all day!
 ThatΓÇÖs a nice sound.
 I still hadnΓÇÖt thanked you for fixing this for me.
 DonΓÇÖt worry about it.
 Hey!
 Stop playing that right now!
 If you donΓÇÖtΓÇª
 Neji. WhatΓÇÖs the big idea?!
 You keep quiet!
 What?!
 ItΓÇÖs as Neji says.
 That mightΓÇÖve been a signal to an enemy!
 A signal?
 Lady Tsunade approved this mission because the suspicious person
 who entered the village the other day still hasnΓÇÖt been caught!
 If that intruder has followed MenmaΓÇª
 he should be close to us now.
 No wayΓÇª
 As of this point, he hasnΓÇÖt shown his presence, though.
 Our mission is to accompany Naruto,
 verify his identity and to capture the intruder!
 Sorry, but I donΓÇÖt trust you!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª ltΓÇÖs natural IΓÇÖd be thought of like thatΓÇª
 I think about this from time to timeΓÇª
 What kind of a person was I?
 What would I do if I were a bad personΓÇª?
 Naruto, what kind of person would you want to be if you were reborn?
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this all of a sudden?
 IΓÇÖm speaking figurativelyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve never thought about it.
 I seeΓÇª
 But why do you ask something like that?
 Oh, no special reasonΓÇª
 What is it?
 WhatΓÇÖs this smell?
 Now that you mention it, it smells like somethingΓÇÖs burning.
 Over there.
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 The smell came from hereΓÇª
 Was there a fire or somethingΓÇª?
 Is something wrong?
 NoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs nothing.
 DonΓÇÖt move. IΓÇÖll fire if you move.
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal all of a sudden?
 Are you their minions?
 ΓÇ£TheirΓÇ¥?
 YouΓÇÖll die here if youΓÇÖre comrades of theirs.
 For crying out loud, who are they?!
 If you say youΓÇÖre not, then show me some proof!
 Proof, why? WeΓÇÖre Leaf Shinobi.
 Hidden Leaf Village?
 See? Look at this.
 Indeed that isΓÇª
 What do Leaf Shinobi want in a place like this?
 Well, we just happened to be passing through andΓÇª
 As you can see, thereΓÇÖs nothing here.
 If you donΓÇÖt have business here, just beat it.
 If you donΓÇÖt, we canΓÇÖt guarantee your life.
 WhatΓÇÖs with him talking all big?!
 Here, he was the one who picked the fight.
 Once weΓÇÖve had our breather,
 letΓÇÖs blow this joint and go look for MenmaΓÇÖs memory.
 R-RightΓÇª
 What? Did you remember something?
 NoΓÇª
 WhoΓÇÖs there? Come on out.
 Hello.
 Y-You guys are Ninja, right?
 I heard what you were talking about earlierΓÇª
 Oh, well, I donΓÇÖt want to brag, butΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre talking about Naruto Uzumaki from Hidden Leaf Village,
 IΓÇÖm pretty well known.
 Really? IΓÇÖm sorry, I didnΓÇÖt know.
 Why did you go to the trouble of following us?
 UmmΓÇª I had a favor to askΓÇª
 My older brother said what he did earlier, butΓÇª
 Older brother?!
 That jerk from earlier?
 We need someone to save our village!
 A person to save your villageΓÇª?
 What do you mean?
 This was the border of the Land of Rice Paddies.
 ButΓÇª
 as our land had caused trouble for other lands,
 this area was turned into a demilitarized zone.
 Are you talking about that thing in questionΓÇª?
 It must be the incident involving Orochimaru.
 ThatΓÇÖs how things were settled with all the neighboring lands, huh?
 But if itΓÇÖs a demilitarized zone, there wonΓÇÖt be any territorial dispute, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 ItΓÇÖs not like that.
 ThereΓÇÖs a small mine in the hills behind the village
 and a little bit of gold can be dug up.
 Once it was discovered that mine is not being supervised by a proprietary land,
 bandits started coming with their eyes on the goldΓÇª
 No matter how often we asked the feudal lord,
 he would insist that, ΓÇ£Agreements between fellow lands must not be broken.ΓÇ¥
 And the villageΓÇª
 It was attacked by bandits, right?
 They withdrew in the middle of it due to a terrible storm before.
 But theyΓÇÖll definitely be back.
 I beg you. Please save our village.
 You guys could fight them!
 All right! Got itΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 We can understand the situation, but we canΓÇÖt cooperate.
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖre you saying, Neji?!
 WeΓÇÖre in the middle of a mission!
 We canΓÇÖt act unless we have an official order from the village!
 ButΓÇª
 Besides, we donΓÇÖt know when the bandits will be back.
 We canΓÇÖt just strand ourselves here forever!
 Damn itΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing Ran, even bringing Fuki here?
 Big BrotherΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt get involved with them. ThereΓÇÖs no such thing as a good Ninja.
 Say what?!
 I just stated the truth.
 The rumor has it that the guys who attacked the village were Rogue Shinobi
 from the Hidden Sound Village.
 Huh? The bandits are Ninja?
 Come this way.
 Look at that.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 One-third of the villagers were killed in the attack the other day.
 Half of the rest abandoned the village and fled.
 Then you guys should also evacuateΓÇª
 Where are we supposed to flee?!
 This is ancestral land thatΓÇÖs been handed down to us
 and that weΓÇÖve cultivated.
 Why should we have to flee from that?!
 Each time the hooligans brandish their power,
 we have to accept it like a natural disaster and do nothing?!
 Are we to just flee from place to place?!
 DonΓÇÖt shout, Big Brother.
 Fuki will get scared.
 IΓÇÖm sorry I shoutedΓÇª
 Her parents were killed by bandits and she lost her ability to speak.
 ThereΓÇÖs no place for us to escape.
 If thatΓÇÖs clear, then beat it already.
 We have no choice. LetΓÇÖs hurry on ahead.
 IΓÇÖm staying here.
 Huh?
 I want to be of use if those people are in trouble.
 Menma!
 Hey, you donΓÇÖt even know the scale of the bandits.
 If you want to help them, no matter what,
 then we should go back to the village andΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt know when they might attack.
 We donΓÇÖt have the time to return to the village!
 Then, IΓÇÖm staying, too!
 Naruto! Anything further than this is beyond the scope of the mission!
 This isnΓÇÖt beyond the scope of the mission!
 I get the feeling IΓÇÖll be able to remember something if I stay here.
 DonΓÇÖt say irresponsible things!
 You couldnΓÇÖt remember anything just a moment agoΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs too convenient!
 It canΓÇÖt be helped, right? Menma himself is saying so.
 HeΓÇÖs good-natured to a fault!
 NarutoΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Menma.
 Right.
 Hey, Naruto!
 WeΓÇÖll deal with the bandits.
 You guys go on back to the village ahead.
 What do we do, Neji?!
 Leave them be.
 ItΓÇÖs unlikely the villagers will accept Naruto and Menma.
 YouΓÇÖve got a pointΓÇª
 It seems the settlement on the other side has escaped damage, huh?
 But howΓÇÖre we supposed to protect the village just the two of usΓÇª?
 LetΓÇÖs build a wall along this creek. This river will play the role of a moat.
 Ultimately weΓÇÖll make a temporary bridge
 and have the entrance to the village in just one location.
 I get itΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know how effective itΓÇÖll be,
 but letΓÇÖs just do the best we can now.
 Right.
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing? I told you to get out.
 We wonΓÇÖt get out!
 What did you say?!
 We decided to protect the village on our own.
 Nobody asked you to do that. ltΓÇÖs none of your business!
 You may say that,
 but you canΓÇÖt beat them off by just hiding in your houses!
 All right, letΓÇÖs stabilize it with a stake.
 Got itΓÇª
 Jeez, what can they do just the two of them?!
 IΓÇÖm readyΓÇª
 Okay.
 Tenten! YouΓÇÖre still here?!
 CanΓÇÖt you at least say thanks first?
 Thanks, Tenten.
 Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right.
 R-RightΓÇª
 You areΓÇª
 For me?
 Then IΓÇÖll help myself.
 Have this, too.
 IΓÇÖll help out, too.
 YouΓÇÖre mine!
 Not yet!
 That technique!
 ItΓÇÖs from that time!
 Neji! YouΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs our mission this time around to catch this guy.
 Heh! This guyΓÇÖs formidable.
 Damn it!
 HeΓÇÖs quick to escape!
 Naruto!
 The sound waves pierced my whole Chakra Network all at once
 and amplified the flow of Chakra?
 I wonΓÇÖt lose to the likes of this guy if I have this Jutsu!
 This is to avenge everyone.
 Eat this!
 YouΓÇÖre in my way!
 Menma!
 Menma! Menma!
 Carry him to the village.
 Manma! Hang in there!
 Boiling water and alcohol!
 All right.
 Are you going to treat him?
 I may not look it, but IΓÇÖve played at being a doctor.
 WeΓÇÖll save you now, Menma.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 I cannot treat this guyΓÇª
 Wh-Why not?!
 This markΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs a comrade of a guy who attacked hereΓÇª!
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Menma is not a member of the bandits.
 I mean, he loves helping people!
 HeΓÇÖs a type of guy who would even risk his own life in order to save a kid!
 For this village too,
 he has worked hard, so hard, even though no one really asked for it.
 HeΓÇÖs got to have some kind of reason.
 So please save Menma!

 I never thought heΓÇÖd attempt to use the Fourth HokageΓÇÖs Jutsu.
 But itΓÇÖs still just this levelΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs completely different from the original one.
 That TsunadeΓÇª lncredibly strong as always.
 I remember a long time ago,
 getting punched by her and knocked back nearly 100 metersΓÇª
 At any rate, NarutoΓÇÖs hopeless.
 Are you okay?
 Jiraiya, was it youΓÇª
 who taught him that Rasengan, the Spiral Chakura Sphere?
 RasenganΓÇª?!
 IΓÇÖm his teacher, after all.
 HumphΓÇªYou and the Fourth Hokage are the only ones who can use that Jutsu.
 Are you in your right mindΓÇª
 showing someone Jutsu that he canΓÇÖt master?
 DonΓÇÖt give him false hope.
 ThatΓÇÖs why the moony kid starts joking about becoming a Hokage!
 ItΓÇÖs no joke! Stupid! Stupid!
 If I have three days, IΓÇÖll master this Jutsu!
 You said it, kid.
 Men donΓÇÖt go back on their word!
 Hah! I stand by my words.
 ThatΓÇÖs my Ninja Way.
 ThenΓÇªhow about a wager?
 A wagerΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 IΓÇÖll acknowledge that you have what it takes to become the Hokage
 and give you this necklace.
 Lady Tsunade! ThatΓÇÖs the precious--!
 I donΓÇÖt need such a sorry necklace!
 DonΓÇÖt say such things, NarutoΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the only one of its kind in this world.
 And you could buy three mountains if you were to sell it.
 It belonged to the First Hokage.
 A-AwesomeΓÇª
 Well, thatΓÇÖll be fine!
 HeΓÇÖll do anything for moneyΓÇª?
 GoodΓÇª
 However, you lose if you canΓÇÖt master the Jutsu in one week!
 And youΓÇÖll give me all the money you have on you.
 Oh! Gama-chan!
 When did sheΓÇª?!
 Lady Tsunade! Why?
 That necklace isΓÇª
 He wonΓÇÖt be able to do it, anywayΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Shizune.
 She never once used that necklace for a betΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Inheritance! The Necklace of Death!
 Huh? Who is it this late at night?
 Okay, okay. IΓÇÖm coming.
 IΓÇÖm sorry to bother you so late, Naruto. I need to talk to youΓÇª
 As for me, IΓÇÖm going to get a good nightΓÇÖs rest and train tomorrow!
 IΓÇÖm sorry. But I didnΓÇÖt want you to misunderstand Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 As well as the necklaceΓÇª
 Humph! I could care less about an old lady like that!
 Lady Tsunade is not the type of person you think she is!
 Don't speak of her like that when you don't even know her!
 I-IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇªfor raising my voice.
 She didnΓÇÖt used to be like that.
 She was a kind person who loved the village.
 But, she changedΓÇª
 After that dayΓÇª
 That day?
 WhatΓÇÖs that day?
 The day she lost her dreams, her love, her hopesΓÇª Everything.
 All that was left was that necklace of memoriesΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.
 ItΓÇÖs really not something to be offered in a bet.
 I donΓÇÖt care about that! She bet it on her own, right?!
 BesidesΓÇªthat necklace is really not something for you to wear.
 ItΓÇÖs not just a necklace!
 It doesnΓÇÖt acknowledge anyone other than Lady Tsunade.
 If someone else wears it, that person inevitablyΓÇª
 ΓÇªdies!
 Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!
 IΓÇÖm not a kid anymore, so I donΓÇÖt need gifts on my birthday!
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying? YouΓÇÖre still a kid, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 But never mind that. Hurry up and open your present!
 YouΓÇÖll definitely be pleased!
 Big Sister, could this beΓÇª?
 YesΓÇª ItΓÇÖs the First HokageΓÇÖs, our grandfatherΓÇÖs necklace!
 I love you, Big Sister!
 I thought itΓÇÖd be better than me having it.
 YouΓÇÖve been wanting it all along, right? Take good care of it.
 Not just this necklace!
 This village is grandfatherΓÇÖs treasure! IΓÇÖm going to protect it!
 NawakiΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm the grandson of the Hokage who built the Village Hidden in Leaves, soΓÇª!
 You said it. Men donΓÇÖt go back on their word!
 Right!
 Someday, IΓÇÖll become just like Grandfather. And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 Take off your headband, Nawaki.
 Just hurry up and take it off. I have another present for you.
 ItΓÇÖs a charm to make your dream come true.
 ItΓÇÖs best if you donΓÇÖt look at the remains.
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing wrong with that, is there?
 Even if she were to look,
 she wouldnΓÇÖt be able to determine that itΓÇÖs her little brother.
 Enough, Orochimaru!
 We are at war, now. All Shinobi end up like this.
 There are no doctors on the battlefield, soΓÇª
 However, children really get much too excited, donΓÇÖt they?
 Especially on the day after they receive a present.
 Not just this necklaceΓÇª
 This village is grandfatherΓÇÖs treasure! IΓÇÖm going to protect it!
 First, in a mission where a Four-Man Cell must act alone
 for a long period of time in enemy territory,
 by deploying one of the four to be a medical specialist,
 the survival rate as well as the mission success rate
 should go up significantly.
 Therefore, establishing a framework
 to foster Ninja possessing advanced medical skills
 and the development of a medical institution
 should be considered an urgent task for the present!
 Yes indeed, itΓÇÖs as you say.
 But weΓÇÖre in the middle of a war now.
 It takes too much time to establish a medical framework.
 And at present, we don't have enough knowledgeΓÇª
 Enemies donΓÇÖt wait.
 What did you say?! Hey, old man!
 Then weΓÇÖll neverΓÇª
 I agree with her.
 I donΓÇÖt want the lives of the Shinobi who died to be for naught.
 There should be something we can learn from that.
 Excuse me!
 Thanks for earlier.
 What you said was right.
 UmmΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs late. Shall I walk you home?
 What? Is that okay with you? WhereΓÇÖs your home?
 The other way.
 Then donΓÇÖt bother.
 I donΓÇÖt mind. I also want to talk with you.
 And I would always use this path to the Academy to pick up my little sister.
 I loved this path.
 What? You loved?
 Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf was attacked at night one year ago,
 my little sister wasΓÇª
 This manΓÇªis the same as me.
 TomorrowΓÇÖs mission will be within enemy linesΓÇª
 Fighting and losing cherished people is not the only way for a Shinobi.
 Uh-huh.
 IΓÇÖm living in a world of Shinobi where death always hovers.
 I want to risk my life to bring this war-torn world under control.
 I love this village and my comrades.
 So I want to protect them.
 Since my little sister died, that sole thought has sustained me.
 So IΓÇÖll become the HokageΓÇª
 An existence that protects everyoneΓÇª
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
 DanΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like youΓÇªto take this.
 Hang on, Dan!
 TsunadeΓÇª I donΓÇÖt wantΓÇªto die yet.
 I have many things that I mustΓÇªdo.
 DonΓÇÖt talk, Dan!
 His kidney has been blown outΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs futile even for Tsunade who is known as one of the SanninΓÇª
 IΓÇªmust notΓÇªdie here.
 ItΓÇÖll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.
 So itΓÇÖll be okayΓÇª YouΓÇÖll be saved, Dan!
 Really?
 Thank goodnessΓÇª
 Dan! Hang on!
 Dan!
 Dang it! DonΓÇÖt come outΓÇª
 StopΓÇª Please stop!
 StopΓÇª StopΓÇª
 StopΓÇª StopΓÇª
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
 Stop, I say!
 ThatΓÇÖs enough. HeΓÇÖs dead!
 You understand, donΓÇÖt you, NarutoΓÇª?
 Ever since that day,
 Lady Tsunade has beenΓÇª in a constant turmoil.
 NarutoΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm heading outΓÇªfor training!
 Oh, you are already at it, I see!
 Hi, welcome!
 Why are you here?
 YouΓÇÖre cold. DonΓÇÖt say that.
 Master JiraiyaΓÇª
 Shizune, could you leave us?
 It's been a while. I want to drink with her again.
 Master, sake! And some radish!
 Coming up!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you, Master Jiraiya.
 Your radish is ready.
 Ooh. This looks good.
 At any rate, to think youΓÇÖd still be taking good care of that necklaceΓÇª
 I thought youΓÇÖd have lost it long since to gambling.
 ItΓÇÖs a memento of those two, right?
 Is he on your mindΓÇª?
 Who?
 Naruto.
 Not particularlyΓÇª
 Still, itΓÇÖs immature, taking on that kid as an opponentΓÇª
 He shouldnΓÇÖt be able to master that Jutsu in a week, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs not whatΓÇÖs called a bet.
 WhatΓÇÖs with the fit of despair?
 ItΓÇÖs not a fit of despair!
 Are you going to meet Orochimaru again?
 I can tell by looking at ShizuneΓÇÖs face.
 I donΓÇÖt know what kind of deal he proposed,
 but donΓÇÖt rush to a decision.
 AndΓÇªlet me just tell you one thing.
 The successive line of Hokages have protected
 the Leaf Village and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives for this dream, this ideal!
 You're not someone who can't understand the feelings of the previous Hokages.
 Just try doing something to betray the Leaf Village.
 When that happens, IΓÇÖll kill you myself!
 It has nothing to do with me now!
 A person who has experienced the death of people close to them
 and doesnΓÇÖt feel anything is just a butcher.
 YouΓÇÖre different, arenΓÇÖt you?
 No one cared for the welfare of the villagers more than you.
 At that time, tooΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs enough with the lecture!
 WhyΓÇªdid you bring that kid?
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
 He resembles him, doesnΓÇÖt he?
 His age is about the same, tooΓÇª
 Not just thatΓÇª
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 Geez, you do nothing, but reckless things.
 Do you want to die?
 YouΓÇÖre still a Genin, so on the battlefield just run away.
 DonΓÇÖt tell a man to ΓÇ£run awayΓÇ¥!
 That dreamΓÇª And his cockiness as wellΓÇª
 No good! Dang it! Dang it! Tomorrow, for sureΓÇª!
 My head hurts.
 I totally got sick from drinking, thanks to herΓÇª
 It seems Naruto never came home last nightΓÇª
 He's such a fool.
 Why donΓÇÖt we make a deal?
 IΓÇÖll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you lovedΓÇª
 with the Forbidden Jutsu IΓÇÖve developed.
 DonΓÇÖt you want to see those two, Tsunade?
 If I treat your armsΓÇª
 What do you intend to do with them?
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf Village!
 No! You must not believe in their sweet talkΓÇª
 Their wishesΓÇª
 Moreover, Tsunade, your wishesΓÇª And dreamsΓÇª Did you forget them ?!
 IΓÇÖll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demanded that you become the Fifth Hokage.
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Darn it! What am I doing?!
 I fell asleep at such an important time!
 Moreover, today is the day of the bet!
 Meanwhile, I don't even know where that old lady Tsunade has gone to!
 My training is not completed yetΓÇª
 I've got to play it by ear and rely on a one-shot deal!

 What do you mean by monitoring Akamaru?
 You know about the incident
 where someone from outside infiltrated the village, right?
 Yeah, I know about that.
 But I heard that Kiba and the others resolved that incident without any trouble.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Damn! That Kiba!
 I want a mission where I totally kick an enemyΓÇÖs butt.
 To be exact, thatΓÇÖs wrong.
 What?
 Before Kiba and the others had the intruder in custodyΓÇª
 he swallowed a pellet and killed himself.
 What? SuicideΓÇª?
 In the investigation that followed,
 it was revealed that the enemy was a Shinobi
 from another land that uses a unique tactic.
 Perhaps he took his own life in order to seal that power.
 WhatΓÇÖs the ΓÇ£uniqueΓÇ¥ tactic?
 Something you would call a biological weapon.
 Biological weapon?
 ItΓÇÖs a particular pathogenΓÇª
 a terrible weapon where someone infected will gradually lose oneself
 and have their body taken over.
 But how is that connected with monitoring Akamaru?
 Could it be that Akamaru wasΓÇª?!
 ThereΓÇÖs a possibility heΓÇÖs infected.
 He still doesnΓÇÖt look so well.
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 Since AkamaruΓÇÖs not in his best condition,
 IΓÇÖm skipping training today as well.
 OkayΓÇª
 Oh!

 Shino, do something quick!
 Shino!

 Jeez, give me a break.

 WeΓÇÖll head back early for the time being. See ya.
 I hopeΓÇª Akamaru gets better soon.

 What is it, Akamaru?
 Oh, shoot! IΓÇÖve been spotted!

 Is there no mistake, Sis?
 IΓÇÖd say the possibility at this point is around fifty-fifty.
 I still havenΓÇÖt been able to identify it,
 but these are the lab results of the blood drawn from AkamaruΓÇª
 But! It could be some kind of mistake!
 Do you think I, a veterinarian, would make such a mistake?
 YeahΓÇª YouΓÇÖre right.
 What is it, Akamaru?!
 Let go! Let go!
 Akamaru, itΓÇÖs Naruto. ItΓÇÖs okay to let go.
 Hey, Akamaru!
 Akamaru!
 What did you do that for Akamaru?
 I mean, whatΓÇÖre you doing in the front yard of my house?
 Huh? Well, thatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Anyway, come in.
 For the time being, I have to fulfill my responsibility as the owner.
 What?
 What?!
 Geez! Biting a comrade of the same village canΓÇÖt be allowed!
 Are you training him properly, Kiba?!
 All right.
 ItΓÇÖs finished! Perfect if I do say so myself!
 Sis! That looks just like a surgical scar!
 What? Really? I thought it turned out well, thoughΓÇª
 Sorry, Naruto.
 Have Sakura or someone patch them up for you!
 Hm? RightΓÇª
 See ya.
 Right.
 See you later too, Miss Hana!
 AkamaruΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm telling you,
 thereΓÇÖs nothing else other than my pants getting all torn up.
 ShinoΓÇÖs insects attacked AkamaruΓÇª
 He even attacked Naruto, whom he should know very well.
 ThereΓÇÖs trouble, Lady Tsunade!
 It seems they were attacked by someone
 in the middle of night training.
 Looks like they launched a sneak attack with quite a few men.
 No, it seems there was just one culprit.
 What?! All of this by one person?!
 To be precise, thatΓÇÖs not correct.
 ItΓÇÖs one animal.
 ThereΓÇÖs no doubt.
 ThereΓÇÖs trouble, Kiba!
 YouΓÇÖre talking about the incident
 where Shinobi were attacked during night training last night, rightΓÇª?
 It-It canΓÇÖt be!
 It seems itΓÇÖs as you said, SisΓÇª
 I can smell blood from Akamaru.
 ThatΓÇÖs Kiba InuzukaΓÇÖs Ninja Hound Akamaru, correct?
 You jerks. What do you want with Akamaru?!
 A warrantΓÇª?
 KibaΓÇª!
 Yes, thereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,
 the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept
 under the supervision of the Anbu Black Ops.
 ΓÇô Damn it! 					ΓÇô Kiba!
 We should obey the Lady HokageΓÇÖs order.
 Damn it!
 AkamaruΓÇª
 Here.
 Thanks, Sis.
 This contains medicine that I prepared,
 so give it to the vet over there.
 Right. IΓÇÖm off, then.
 NarutoΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs the idea of Akamaru being detained?!
 Akamaru is the culprit from last nightΓÇÖs incident.
 We have sufficient proof as well.
 At this point, itΓÇÖs an unavoidable measure.
 The Medical Team is now desperately looking for a way to save Akamaru.
 DonΓÇÖt worry too much.
 IfΓÇªthat doesnΓÇÖt work either, whatΓÇÖll happen to Akamaru?
 At that timeΓÇª
 thereΓÇÖll be nothing left to do but to put Akamaru down!
 Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital
 You donΓÇÖt need to worry.
 The Medical Corps will figure something out soon.
 RightΓÇª
 Take care on your way home.
 Right.
 AkamaruΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt hand you over to anyone.
 It seems Kiba Inuzuka has taken Akamaru and fled.
 Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?
 In preparation for the worst,
 have the Special Pursuit Corps stand by here!
 The Special Pursuit CorpsΓÇª
 C-Could it be that youΓÇÖre really going to kill AkamaruΓÇªGrandma?
 Grandma Tsunade!
 ItΓÇÖs hard for me, too.
 Damn it!
 Did you find them?!
 No!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 HeΓÇÖs rapidly getting worse.
 Akamaru!
 Where are they?
 They should be around here.
 I swore to protect him, no matter what!
 I swore never IΓÇÖd never let him go through that experience ever againΓÇª!
 The Special Pursuit Corps has assembled.
 Show the team in.
 Kiba!
 Where are you?!
 I guess I was able to hide my tracks somewhatΓÇª
 This is a serum for Akamaru that the Medical Corps whipped up.
 I canΓÇÖt guarantee the level of effect.
 ThereΓÇÖs maybe a fifty-percent chance of survival.
 ThereΓÇÖs also a risk of side-effects
 that would cause Akamaru to go even more berserk.
 In the event that happensΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs an unavoidable measure, but Akamaru mustΓÇª
 Reporting!
 The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has lost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.
 Lady Tsunade.
 That way?!
 AkamaruΓÇª
 Kiba!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs that?
 ItΓÇÖs AkamaruΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 Have you come to kill Akamaru?!
 No! I just came out of concern!
 You lie! The Lady Hokage said it, didnΓÇÖt she?!
 ThereΓÇÖll be nothing else to do but to kill Akamaru.
 You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!
 I wonΓÇÖt hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be doing that!
 Something called the Special Pursuit Corps or whatever is coming after Akamaru!
 What?!
 The Pursuit Corps should be here soon.
 Akamaru will really be in trouble if that happens!
 You and I have to do something before that!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be fighting!
 Shut up!
 Why donΓÇÖt you get it, Kiba?!
 Shut up!
 All right! IΓÇÖve sighted Akamaru!
 Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!
 C-Could it beΓÇªthe Pursuit Corps isΓÇª
 Sis!
 You gotta beΓÇª joking, right?
 Sis!
 WhatΓÇÖre you going to do to Akamaru with that?
 This is medicine I received from the Hokage.
 IΓÇÖm going to inject it into Akamaru.
 Then Akamaru will be saved?!
 The probability is fifty-fifty.
 If it fails and side-effects are produced,
 AkamaruΓÇÖs symptoms will get even worse.
 All we can do now is take a chance on this.
 If the worst happens and it failsΓÇª
 You understand, right, Kiba?
 Damn itΓÇª
 Even if itΓÇÖs only fifty percent,
 thereΓÇÖs a possibility that Akamaru will be saved.
 WeΓÇÖve gotta do this! IΓÇÖll also help out, miss!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kiba, what about you?!
 If youΓÇÖre not going to do anything, youΓÇÖre in the way, so beat it!
 LetΓÇÖs go, Kiba.
 Just leave that coward be.
 YouΓÇÖre ready, right? LetΓÇÖs go, Naruto!
 WeΓÇÖll save you now, Akamaru!
 Aim for the legs! lmmobilize Akamaru!
 Right!
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, I have no choice.
 I must terminate Akamaru.
 Stop!
 I said stopΓÇª Akamaru.
 Kiba!
 Kiba?
 AkamaruΓÇª
 Have you forgottenΓÇªmy scent?
 We were always together from when we were little, werenΓÇÖt we?
 AkamaruΓÇª
 WhyΓÇªwhyΓÇªdid you become like this?
 Please rememberΓÇª Akamaru!
 Kiba!
 I'm sorry, AkamaruΓÇª
 I put you through nothing but painful experiences.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, AkamaruΓÇª I couldnΓÇÖt protect youΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª AkamaruΓÇª
 I'm a terrible master.
 ButΓÇª
 IΓÇÖllΓÇªalways be with you.
 KibaΓÇª
 Kiba!
 It really wouldΓÇÖve been touch and go
 if the Medical Corps had been even a little late in arriving.
 Without a doubt,
 he wouldΓÇÖve lost his life if AkamaruΓÇÖs attack had hit KibaΓÇÖs vital spotΓÇª
 Really, it could have been much worse.
 ThatΓÇÖs wrongΓÇª
 Huh? Kiba?!
 When he came at me with his final attack,
 Akamaru just barely missed my vital spots.
 He drained all his remaining strength in order to desperately control himself.
 Akamaru was battling desperately with himself.
 ThatΓÇÖs admirable, Akamaru!
 ThanksΓÇª
 Akamaru.
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 In this world, there remain mysteries yet unsolved.
 We came to the Hidden Leaf Village in search of mystery
 and encountered a succession of hair-raising terror.
 However, we charge forward without being daunted
 by the forest that bares its fangs.
 And then at lastΓÇª!
 We witness with our own eyes,
 the creature of the legend handed down from generation to generation.
 Next time: ΓÇ£A Legend from the Hidden Leaf: 		The Onbaa!

185,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Oh!
 Sorry, sorry.
 Was that some eagle poop just now?
 Nothing there, huh?
 Well, I worked up a sweat,
 so I guess IΓÇÖll go home and take a shower.
 A Legend from the Hidden Leaf: The Onbaa!
 I worked up a good sweat today too.
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal, Akamaru?
 He says you smell bad, Naruto.
 Are you making sure to take a bath?
 DonΓÇÖt be saying rude things!
 No, you seriously stink.
 Come to think of itΓÇª
 The poop from the eagle a moment ago mightΓÇª
 Sakura.
 Oh, I found a slacker who canΓÇÖt get a mission!
 ThatΓÇÖs justΓÇª IΓÇÖm not that much a slacker!
 So it seems. You mustΓÇÖve done some reckless training.
 ItΓÇÖs ripped.
 Huh? YouΓÇÖre right. I didnΓÇÖt notice!
 It canΓÇÖt be helped.
 Bring it to me later. IΓÇÖll sew it up for you.
 Really?! Really?! Really?!
 Sakura, youΓÇÖre such a nice person.
 ItΓÇÖs the first time in my lifeΓÇª youΓÇÖve been this nice to me!
 H-Hey, Naruto. YouΓÇÖre exaggerating.
 Naruto!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Sakura?!
 You touched my breast just now, didnΓÇÖt you?!
 I didnΓÇÖt do anything like that!
 Then, whatΓÇÖre those hairy hands sticking out from your armpit?!
 WhatΓÇÖsΓÇªthat?
 Huh? Huh?!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Your back.
 Huh?
 Wh-What in the world is this?!
 ItΓÇÖs a huge poop!
 Idiot! ThatΓÇÖs some kind of creature!
 Is it a caterpillar?!
 What?! Get it off.
 No, this is an animal.
 Let go!
 Give me a break.
 You guys, have you ever heard of the legend of Onbaa?
 Onbaa?
 IΓÇÖve never heard of it!
 Shizune! You donΓÇÖt know?
 Nope. Is that legend something like an old tale or something?
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thought, butΓÇª
 Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legendΓÇª
 A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa
 who lived deep in the mountains near the villageΓÇª
 One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest
 saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa
 for his summer vacation independent research.
 The Pervy Sage?
 YesΓÇª
 Are you an idiot?
 Do you seriously think thereΓÇÖs an Onbaa?
 Well, youΓÇÖll get yours when you see my independent research!
 Who would?
 Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldnΓÇÖt deal with youΓÇª
 You said it! Flat-chested girl!
 WhoΓÇÖs flat-chested?!
 No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!
 You wanna bet on that?
 Yeah! IΓÇÖll bet!
 Then, IΓÇÖll bet on Jiraiya.
 Huh?!
 Then, IΓÇÖm off to wrestle with an Onbaa!
 And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?
 When he came back three days later,
 he said he won with a force-out moveΓÇª
 which most likely was a lie.
 Oh! here it is.
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs this?
 What lousy writing!
 YouΓÇÖre one to talk, Naruto.
 LetΓÇÖs seeΓÇª The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.
 The Onbaa is scary.
 No one is a match for it when it gets mad.
 But I beat it at wrestling.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 The OnbaaΓÇÖs child likes being carried piggyback.
 They grow up on the parentΓÇÖs back.
 What?!
 What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, butΓÇª
 So there was an OnbaaΓÇª
 Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,
 it stays piggyback on my back and wonΓÇÖt get off.
 What should I do?
 According to legend, the child Onbaa considers
 the first thing it sees after birth as its parent
 and clings to the back of that person.
 It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,
 until they become an adult.
 It seems until then, they never leave the parentΓÇÖs back.
 Then, thereΓÇÖs no other way but to wait until it grows up.
 You say that, but when it grows upΓÇª
 itΓÇÖll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?
 WhatΓÇÖs up with that straightforward reaction?
 Well, itΓÇÖs a legend, so itΓÇÖll probably get off eventuallyΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt be so irresponsible!
 H-Hang in there, NarutoΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.
 Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!
 What is it?
 I wonΓÇÖt lose, you know!
 This isnΓÇÖt a weight, man!
 What is it, Hinata?
 NarutoΓÇª I heard a strange rumor.
 A strange rumorΓÇªyou say?
 That youΓÇªummΓÇªhad a child.
 Oh. You mean this?
 Huh?! Hinata!
 Hey! You okay?! Hinata!
 Hinata, Hinata!
 Hinata?!
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal? YouΓÇÖre sure an extravagant guyΓÇª
 Oh!
 Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?
 Ichiraku Ramen
 You know, we donΓÇÖt allow pets.
 The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.
 I missed dinner because of him.
 Overlook it just for today.
 But now that I look closer, heΓÇÖs cute, isnΓÇÖt he?
 So, whatΓÇÖs his name?
 HeΓÇÖs saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.
 Onbu, huhΓÇª?
 DoesnΓÇÖt he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?
 Here.
 Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!
 Coming right up!
 Ever since you clung to my back,
 IΓÇÖve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.
 Well, I guess it canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs gotten bigΓÇª! And so quicklyΓÇª
 This is bad!
 Naruto Uzumaki, you are assigned a mission
 for the removal of the mountain bandits from Yamabuki Pass!
 Removal? Hey old ladyΓÇª
 OnbuΓÇÖs gotten big,
 so you intend to get rid of the troublemaker, right?
 N-No, itΓÇÖs not like that.
 I was thinking youΓÇÖve had some eye-opening growth recently, so.
 Then, what about the other members?
 NoΓÇª
 Since youΓÇÖve shown such remarkable growth,
 a solo infiltration should be fine.
 Sure enough, itΓÇÖs getting rid of the troublemaker!
 This is also fateΓÇª Okay now, back to work.
 Thanks, mister!
 N-Naruto, Naruto.
 Things are fun when youΓÇÖre around, Onbu!
 That Grandma Tsunade.
 DonΓÇÖt think you were able to get rid of the troublemaker so easily.
 IΓÇÖll beat the mountain bandits and finish up this mission lickety-split
 and the two of us will return to the Leaf Village with pride!
 Right, Onbu?!
 Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!
 WhoΓÇÖre you, creep?!
 WhoΓÇÖre you?!
 What do you want?!
 IΓÇÖm Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!
 Prepare yourselves!
 ΓÇô Say what?! 					ΓÇô Get him!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01	02:29:44:16	02:29:45:10	Onbu!
 Even knowing itΓÇÖs a cloneΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt forgive those who hurt Onbu!
 Heh! How was that?!
 Die!
 Onbu! You saved me!
 OnbuΓÇª I owe you my life.
 LetΓÇÖs get back to the village quick and surprise everyone!
 Onbu! No way will I believe that youΓÇÖre a dangerous creature!
 WeΓÇÖll go as the Onbu-Naruto team succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!
 What was that?
 ItΓÇÖs okayΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve got me with you.
 Onbu?! No, itΓÇÖs huge!
 Could it beΓÇªyouΓÇÖre after Onbu?
 Are you OnbuΓÇÖs mom?!
 W-W-W-Wait! I didnΓÇÖt steal him!
 Onbu! Say something, will you?!
 Y-You idiot, Onbu!
 No, y- youΓÇÖve got the wrong idea!
 Onbu, itΓÇÖs your mom.
 ItΓÇÖs not my intention!
 Damn it! I had a rough time of it.
 If you're a mother,
 then take better care of your child, really!
 ItΓÇÖs okay! IΓÇÖll return Onbu to you! So rest easy.
 Huh? My body got light.
 Huh? Onbu? You got so big!
 Huh, wha--? WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Onbu?!
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal?!
 W-W-W-WaitΓÇª Onbu, itΓÇÖs me! CanΓÇÖt you tell?!
 We were getting along so well just a moment ago!
 Please remember me!
 ItΓÇÖs me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!
 Oh, yeah! Naruto!
 Naruto! Naruto!
 Onbu, look at this!
 Remember! Remember this spiral!
 Naruto, Naruto!
 You remember my back you clung to the whole time, donΓÇÖt you?
 Have IΓÇªhad it?
 OnbuΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm tiredΓÇª
 This feels kind of goodΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs like IΓÇÖm being carried piggyback.
 OnbuΓÇª
 Onbu!
 Live in good health with your mom.
 All right!
 My sidesΓÇªare splitting!
 Onbaa is now no longer a legend.
 TheyΓÇÖre thriving in the village forest and seriously proliferating.
 The stupid eagles carried them in, so.
 Naruto! HowΓÇÖd you tear it off you?! Tell me!
 Who knows? All I did was wrestle with Onbu.
 DonΓÇÖt be so mean!
 At this rate, the village will be crushed.
 Tell me! Naruto!
 DonΓÇÖt look at me.
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.

 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Shino and I have been sent to a certain village to deal with
 a dispute over a family head who passed away.
 An old woman suddenly appears on the road and says this to us.
 ΓÇ£Even dead men laugh in Motoyoshi Village.ΓÇ¥
 They were mysterious words. I never imagined it at this time.
 To think I would see with my own eyes,
 a sight in this village too frightening to even talk aboutΓÇª
 Next: ΓÇ£Laughing Shino.ΓÇ¥
 I canΓÇÖt even go to the bathroom alone at night.

 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so donΓÇÖt hide your fists
 YouΓÇÖre not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 DonΓÇÖt forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre way too young to die

 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 It's unforgivable!
 Those guysΓÇª 					the Fuma NinjaΓÇª
 Their feelings towards the clan are the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the FumaΓÇÖs feelings of wanting to restore their clanΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll kick OrochimaruΓÇÖs butt, no matter what!
 Pure Terror                          The House of Orochimaru
 How did the Pervy Sage,
 who was once so easily defeated by Old Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs numbing medicine
 detect SasameΓÇÖs medicine this time?
 IsnΓÇÖt it strange that Master JiraiyaΓÇÖs that sharp?
 Hey, heyΓÇª
 Remember when Sasame talked about Hanzaki and said heΓÇÖs a traitor?
 ThatΓÇÖs how I knewΓÇª
 Hanzaki told me everythingΓÇª
 When Orochimaru came to this land, there were those among us
 who wanted to use his strength to revive the clan
 and those that saw his evil intent and said we should not join him.
 HmmΓÇª so thatΓÇÖs why you guys were chased out of your village.
 Yes. It was probably OrochimaruΓÇÖs idea we were chased out of our village
 as traitors who were getting in the way of a revival of the clan.
 When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,
 I knew that Sasame had ties to a group that was on OrochimaruΓÇÖs side.
 Fool!
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Just wait a minute!
 IΓÇÖm prepared!
 Sasame, you did it so that you could meet ArashiΓÇª Isn't that so?
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª that was the only thing I could do.
 Master Jiraiya!
 Sasame did it only because she wanted to see her cousin.
 Please forgive her!
 IΓÇÖm asking you to forgive her too!
 The law of the Shinobi is a strict thingΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt just acquit her like this.
 Then punish me first!
 I promised IΓÇÖd help Sasame see her cousin Arashi!
 If I donΓÇÖt fulfill that IΓÇÖll have twisted my Way of Ninja!
 Master Jiraiya, me too!
 Now now, wait a minute! ltΓÇÖs not as if IΓÇÖm gonna eat her alive.
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô Oh?
 Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that
 you might leave your village to look for ArashiΓÇª
 After you escort us to OrochimaruΓÇÖs hideout,
 youΓÇÖll immediately head to the inn where Hanzaki is
 and wait there for our return.
 That is the punishment given to you.
 Master JiraiyaΓÇª
 Pervy Sage, IΓÇÖve gotta give you more credit!
 Thank you, Master Jiraiya!
 Well, Hanzaki treated me to a lot of special service at the Fuma Bar
 and asked me to look after SasameΓÇª
 I thought it was something like that anyway!
 I feel cheated that I gave you more credit!
 He, heyΓÇª ltΓÇÖs all right once in a while, right?
 ThereΓÇÖs something called socializing for adultsΓÇª
 There it isΓÇª.
 Leave the rest to us.
 Sasame, be careful going back to the inn.
 DonΓÇÖt worry! I will absolutely bring Arashi back!
 Please take care of Arashi!
 Leave it to me!
 Just wait, and rest assured that IΓÇÖll do everything I can!
 Stop getting so carried away Naruto, you idiot!
 Oww!
 ThatΓÇÖs whereΓÇª
 Sasuke isΓÇª!
 So this is the only entranceΓÇª
 If theyΓÇÖre lying in wait, weΓÇÖll be picked off.
 But thereΓÇÖs nothing we can do but go!
 Well, donΓÇÖt panic.
 If three large rats go, weΓÇÖll stand out.
 First, letΓÇÖs send out one that wonΓÇÖt stand out.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Hey!
 Th-The frog spoke!
 Hey, itΓÇÖs been a while! Sakura, this is Gamakichi.
 Gamakichi?!
 I wanted to ask you to do some reconnaissance.
 All right! ThatΓÇÖs a simple task. Leave it to me!
 I canΓÇÖt help it, frogs give me the creeps ΓÇª
 There doesnΓÇÖt seem to be anything fishyΓÇª
 There doesnΓÇÖt seem to be a trap at the entrance.
 ArashiΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing to it around here.
 HmmΓÇª
 What shall we do?
 It seems thereΓÇÖs no choice but to split up into three.
 My instinct tells me itΓÇÖs the middle one!
 Wait!
 What the heck?!
 At times like this, itΓÇÖs especially important to move carefullyΓÇª
 All right, IΓÇÖll go this way!
 ThatΓÇÖs it?!
 So whatΓÇÖs so different from my instinct and that, Pervy Sage?
 Well, itΓÇÖs a question of feelingΓÇª
 If you havenΓÇÖt found anything after 30 minutes, come back.
 Got it?
 YeahΓÇª
 Naruto, Sakura, the two of you should proceed together.
 Listen, from this point forward, itΓÇÖs the first avenue of hell.
 A demon might appear, or a snake might appear.
 Take them on mindfully!
 Yup!
 I understand!
 WeΓÇÖre going down the middle!
 Then IΓÇÖm going this wayΓÇª
 See ya ΓÇª
 HmmΓÇªthe smell of face powder.
 IΓÇÖm being invited inΓÇª
 In that case, it might be good fun to accept the invitation.
 WhatΓÇª?
 Because guests would be arriving from far away,
 I was directed by Lord Orochimaru to entertain.
 IΓÇÖm guessing it's a type of fox raccoon ghostΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre saying IΓÇÖm some raccoon or fox,
 you ought to come over here and check to see if I have a tail or not.
 Oh, this path was right onΓÇª
 How about yours, Naruto?
 Sakura, be careful!
 ThereΓÇÖs no telling what sort of traps there might beΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª
 ΓÇô Oh?! 					ΓÇô Naruto?!
 And you were the one who said to be careful!
 It was an ingenious trap floor!
 Oh!
 What the hell is next!
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs my faultΓÇª
 Naruto!
 What the hellΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt get outΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 You screamed in such a misleading way, I totally thoughtΓÇª
 Give me a hand!
 YouΓÇÖre really a handful!
 Ya saved meΓÇª
 Really! IΓÇÖll go first!
 NarutoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs all right now.
 Here!
 Huh?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Naruto?! Are you all right?
 DonΓÇÖt worry about me.
 You need to hurry and get out of this trap hallway!
 ButΓÇª
 I said go! IΓÇÖll follow behind for sure!
 Really?
 YeahΓÇª IΓÇÖll catch up in no time!
 YouΓÇÖd better come, no matter what.
 ItΓÇÖs a promise, you knowΓÇª
 The sake doesnΓÇÖt seem tampered with.
 So what kind of plot has been preparedΓÇª?
 Just as IΓÇÖd expect from the Village Hidden in SoundΓÇª
 Are you planning to put a Jutsu on me using music?
 The music isnΓÇÖt only for guests. ltΓÇÖs for myselfΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 What do you play for your heart?
 Music for my own funeralΓÇª
 Trying to seduce meΓÇª. YouΓÇÖve underestimated this Jiraiya!
 Escorting the guest to the underworld is my last mission.
 A suspended ceiling?!
 I need to hurry up and get out of this place!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 This is torture!
 What the hell?!
 Give me a hand!
 We need to build up our Chakra and create the Rasengan!
 DonΓÇÖt be absurd!
 We canΓÇÖt stretch our bodies beyond this!
 My muscles are cramping up!
 Man! IΓÇÖve gotta do somethingΓÇª
 ΓÇô What! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 What?!
 ΓÇô Water?! 					ΓÇô Water!
 Looks like IΓÇÖve been saved.
 Hey, get outta my way!
 Oh, itΓÇÖs you, Naruto.
 Gamakichi, is there a way out somewhere?
 DonΓÇÖt know! I was flushed down here too.
 So itΓÇÖs no goodΓÇª
 Hey, are you all right?
 How could I be all right!
 NarutoΓÇÖs taking a long time.
 Maybe I should go backΓÇª
 It's admirable that you made it this far, Sakura.
 Is that KabutoΓÇÖs voice?!
 IsnΓÇÖt it ironic?
 During the Chunin Exam in the Village Hidden in the Leaves,
 you were the only one that dragged the team down,
 but yet youΓÇÖre the one to make it this far.
 IΓÇÖm not by myself!
 Naruto and Master Jiraiya will be here right away!
 WhereΓÇÖs Sasuke? He is all right, isnΓÇÖt he?
 ShouldnΓÇÖt you be worried about Naruto and Master Jiraiya,
 and not Sasuke?
 Well, it may very well be that those two are no longer in this world anymore.
 No wayΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto would be taken down that easily!
 I wonder if thatΓÇÖs so?
 Maybe you dragged Naruto down like you always do?
 So IΓÇÖm right ΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre worried you should go and seeΓÇª
 Or perhaps youΓÇÖre afraid of me attacking
 and you canΓÇÖt come out from behind the pillar.
 If someone like you were on my team,
 I donΓÇÖt know how many lives I would need.
 I can tooΓÇª
 I can too!
 Substitution Jutsu?!
 Substitution again?!
 I can tooΓÇª When I fight, I fight!
 As I thought, this is all youΓÇÖve gotΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs about time I put an end to this.
 I canΓÇÖt keep Lord Orochimaru waiting for no reason any longer, you see.
 Orochimaru?!
 NowΓÇªshall we seeΓÇª
 just who will be stealing scrolls from whom?
 WeΓÇÖll fight to the death!
 No! IΓÇÖm different from how I wasΓÇªthen!
 I wonder if thatΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 Even if you put up a bluff, I can foresee ΓÇª
 You are alreadyΓÇªfinished.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm scared. What is this intimidating feeling?
 My legs are weak and I donΓÇÖt have any strength in my body.
 I thought IΓÇÖm not the same person as I was in the past.
 I must stop. Calm down.
 These guys are here, which means Sasuke is definitely here!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 IΓÇÖm going to be Hokage!
 I wonΓÇÖt lose here!
 Whatever! You canΓÇÖt keep up with my speed at all!
 U-!
 Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
 Naruto Barrage!
 The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªgetting stronger!
 Ohhhh!
 Cha!
 Nice one! You did it!
 T-That Naruto beat Kiba!
 ItΓÇÖs a major upsetΓÇª
 Yup!
 Yes!
 Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!
 This medicine works really well!
 Here! Do you want to use it too, Sakura?
 Only your wounds heal with such speedΓÇªNaruto.
 The power of Nine Tail never cease to amaze me.
 U-Umm...
 T-This isΓÇª
 ointment for your wound,
 for you Kiba and Akamaru.
 Rather than worrying about others,
 itΓÇÖs about time you worried about yourself!
 KibaΓÇª
 There are only 6 people leftΓÇª
 you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy, and the Sand guy.
 Listen, HinataΓÇª
 If you pull that guy from Sand, withdraw quickly.
 And thereΓÇÖs one moreΓÇª
 Do the same if you get Neji, too.
 Withdraw quicklyΓÇª
 That guy will be hard on you.
 He will destroy you.
 Well, letΓÇÖs announce the next match.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 ΓÇô What? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 HinataΓÇª
 This is going to be an interesting matchΓÇª
 I never thought that I would have a fight with youΓÇª
 Lady Hinata.
 Brother NejiΓÇª
 Brother?
 Huh?!
 Those two are siblings?
 TheyΓÇÖre descended from
 one of the most honorable old families in the Hidden LeafΓÇª
 The Hyuga Clan.
 But, theyΓÇÖre not siblings.
 Then, how are they related?
 Well, the relation of a head family and branch familyΓÇª
 That may be an appropriate way to say it.
 Head family and branch family?
 Yes!
 Hinata is from the head family.
 In other words, a person from the main household
 and Neji is from a branch family that is descended from that family.
 In other words, itΓÇÖs a fight between relatives.
 It must be uneasy for both of themΓÇª
 Yes.
 HoweverΓÇª
 Huh? What is it?
 IΓÇÖve heard that from long ago,
 thereΓÇÖve been various incidents between the head family and branch family,
 and now their relationship isnΓÇÖt on very good terms.
 Hmmm.
 Why?
 I donΓÇÖt know the details either.
 OnlyΓÇª
 The so-called distinguished Ninja clans like Uchiha and Hyuga
 have special techniques and abilities that run in the family.
 It seems that the Hyuga household laid down rules
 for communicating those techniquesΓÇª
 It seems that there are many rules that favor the head familyΓÇª
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 And there have been various incidents
 between the head family and branch family due to those rules.
 So this is a confrontation billed as a clash of fateΓÇª
 Oh, itΓÇÖs gonna begin.
 Start the battle please!
 Just one thing before we square off against each other in the fightΓÇª
 I should advise you, Lady Hinata.
 Withdraw!
 YouΓÇÖre not suited to being a Shinobi.
 YouΓÇÖre too nice.
 You wish for harmony and avoid conflict,
 youΓÇÖre open to going with the thinking of others.
 And, you have no confidence in yourself.
 YouΓÇÖre always feeling inferiorΓÇª
 You thought itΓÇÖs a good idea to stay Genin.
 However, you canΓÇÖt register for the Chunin test without three membersΓÇª
 So you couldnΓÇÖt turn down when Kiba and the other proposed it and,
 the truth is, you entered the exam reluctantly.
 Is that wrong?!
 T-ThatΓÇÖs wrongΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not trueΓÇª
 IΓÇª
 I onlyΓÇª
 I wanted to change that about myselfΓÇª
 So I proposed it myselfΓÇª
 HinataΓÇª
 Stand up, Hanabi!
 From now on, IΓÇÖll keep Hinata under my wingΓÇª
 But is that really okay?
 Hinata should be the heir to the Hyuga clanΓÇª
 But, there is always death involved with the job of Genin.
 Do what you want.
 SheΓÇÖs a failure whoΓÇÖs inferior even to her younger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.
 We donΓÇÖt need her here in Hyuga clanΓÇª
 Is that all you have to say?
 If so, leave!
 YouΓÇÖre in the way!
 Yes.
 Hinata is trying to change herself in her own way.
 Lady HinataΓÇª
 You are a spoiled one of the head family.
 People can never change!
 A failure will always be a failureΓÇª
 That personality and strength wonΓÇÖt change.
 That guyΓÇª
 Since people donΓÇÖt change, differences exist among themΓÇª
 and expressions like ΓÇ£eliteΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£failureΓÇ¥ are born.
 Everyone judges and are judged
 based on the value of their face and brain, ability and body type,
 good and bad points of their personalities.
 People have to suffer and live
 within the means of the elements they cannot change.
 Just like the fact that IΓÇÖm from a branch family
 and youΓÇÖre from the head family,
 these things canΓÇÖt change.
 IΓÇÖve seen everything with this Byakugan.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I understand!
 YouΓÇÖre just talking tough.
 YouΓÇÖre really thinking that youΓÇÖd like to run away from this placeΓÇª
 T-ThatΓÇÖs wrongΓÇª
 I reallyΓÇª
 Byakugan?
 ItΓÇÖs said that if you trace the Uchiha ClanΓÇÖs history,
 the clanΓÇÖs ability has its source in Hyuga clan.
 The Byakugan is one of the Hyuga clanΓÇÖs Kekkei Genkai,
 a Visual Jutsu similar to SharinganΓÇª
 However, with the ability of insight aloneΓÇª
 it gets the better of Sharingan.
 Byakugan!
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 My eyes canΓÇÖt be deceived.
 Just now from my pressure,
 your line of sight was pushed to the upper left.
 This is the sign that you're recalling your past experienceΓÇª
 your bitter past.
 And soon after that, your line of sight moved to the bottom rightΓÇª
 This is the sign that you're imagining physical and mental suffering.
 That meansΓÇª
 youΓÇÖre picturing your old self,
 and from all of your experiences up until now,
 youΓÇÖre imagining the result of this battleΓÇª
 The image of you losing!
 Even the act of propping your arms in front of your bodyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a gesture that means
 you want to build a wall between us and keep distant.
 And that reflects your mind...
 that you donΓÇÖt want any more of your deepest feelings to be raidedΓÇª
 Because everything IΓÇÖve said is right on the mark, right?
 FurthermoreΓÇª
 Laying a finger on your lips,
 that too, is a self-familiarizing act which represents a sense of panic.
 It represents a defense instinct--
 you want to alleviate the tension and unease.
 In other wordsΓÇª
 deep in your heart, you know itΓÇÖs true, donΓÇÖt you?
 Changing yourself, is something you absolutely canΓÇÖt--!
 Sure, she can!
 You donΓÇÖt have the privilege of deciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Give it to him, Hinata!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Hinata!
 DonΓÇÖt just take it! Argue back!
 IΓÇÖm getting irritated watching this!
 NarutoΓÇª
 What an annoying guy!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyes has changedΓÇª
 So youΓÇÖre not going to withdraw?
 I ΓÇÿm not taking responsibility for what happens!
 IΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt run away!
 I donΓÇÖtΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt change my wordsΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs my Way of Ninja!
 ...want to run anymore!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji!
 I challenge you!
 T-That isΓÇª
 FineΓÇª
 Of course, the same Hyuga styleΓÇª
 Her pose is very similar to NejiΓÇÖs.
 Hyuga style?
 The strongest Taijutsu style in the Village Hidden in the LeafΓÇª
 Huh?
 I said it before...
 The man who is most likely
 the strongest Genin of Hidden Leaf Village is on my teamΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 That guy, Neji Hyuga.
 Here!
 Did it go in?!
 NoΓÇªit was shallow!
 No. Even a graze works.
 ThatΓÇÖs the reason that the Hyuga clan
 is called the Hidden LeafΓÇÖs distinguished family.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 The Hyuga has a particular Taijutsu passed down through generations.
 ItΓÇÖs not like the kind of Taijutsu that Lee and I are good atΓÇª
 Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,
 is mainly to inflict external damage on our enemy,
 like broken bones and surface wounds.
 In contrast, the HyugaΓÇÖs Taijutsu inflict damage
 on the Chakra Network through which Chakra flow through the body,
 and damaging the insides, namely, it destroys internal organs.
 They possess the Gentle Fist.
 ItΓÇÖs not spectacular to watchΓÇª
 but later it slowly takes effect.
 Well, you canΓÇÖt train the internal organsΓÇª
 Even if you were really robust,
 one hit from it would be a deadly blowΓÇª
 Even I canΓÇª
 HinataΓÇÖs on the offensiveΓÇª
 HinataΓÇª
 Way to go, Hinata!
 To attack the Chakra NetworkΓÇª
 What are they, those peopleΓÇª?
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Chakra Network, whatΓÇÖs that?!
 Here we go againΓÇª
 a question from a stupid guy.
 IΓÇÖll explain.
 TheyΓÇÖre like blood canals.
 In the same way that blood flows through vessels throughout the body,
 TheyΓÇÖre bundles of canals that take ChakraΓÇÖs into every corner of your bodyΓÇª
 Oh!
 Like a path for Chakras, huh?
 YesΓÇª
 Furthermore, the Chakra Network is closely connected
 with the internal organs which enfold Chakra within the body.
 ThatΓÇÖs why if the Chakra Network is attacked
 the internal organs also suffer damage.
 Huh, you know a lot, donΓÇÖt 'ya?
 Hey you! That's no way to talk to your senior!
 ItΓÇÖs no wonderΓÇª
 LeeΓÇÖs greatest long-standing enemy.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 him.
 SenseiΓÇª
 But, how can they do that?
 After all, the Chakra Network isnΓÇÖt visible to the eyes.
 How do they attack the Chakra line inside the body?
 No.
 The eyes of those twoΓÇª
 They can see it with their Byakugan.
 And a Gentle Fist attack is a little different from a regular attack.
 They release their own Chakra
 from a Chakra opening in their hand and screw it into their opponentΓÇÖs body.
 It directly inflicts damage on your enemyΓÇÖs Chakra Network.
 All right!
 Has she done it?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Amazing!
 That Hinata!
 SheΓÇÖs always melancholy and wishy-washy andΓÇª
 I thought she is kinda weird, yetΓÇª
 Even when she gets blow after blow, she gets back up and goes.
 ThereΓÇÖs something about her way of fighting.
 Just a feeling, but she resembles you, I think.
 Resembles me? Hinata resembles me?
 Now that I think about it, that girl, she was always watching you.
 Huh?

 Yakumo has been sedated to calm her nerves and is asleep now.
 But it would be best for her
 to have a complete examination back at the village hospital.
 It was a big help having you here, Sakura.
 You should also get some first-aid treatment, Sensei.
 RightΓÇª Thanks.
 Okay, please show me.
 TheyΓÇÖve been like this the whole time.
 It doesnΓÇÖt look like theyΓÇÖll wake up from the Genjutsu
 for quite a whileΓÇª
 Well, I guess that serves our interests better. Hm?
 ItΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!
 Y-YesΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs not okay!
 Wha--?!
 I gave her some first-aid treatment, but she has a deep wound.
 We must get back to the village quicklyΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt worry about me.
 IΓÇÖm more concerned about YakumoΓÇÖs instability.
 Yeah, their comrades could very well return.
 IΓÇÖm also concerned about
 how we havenΓÇÖt seen the three people who were assigned to guard Yakumo.
 All right!
 Leave this to me and all of you head back to the village
 with Kurenai and Yakumo!
 Organize a back-up unit.
 Your opponents are practitioners of Genjutsu.
 Will you be okay alone?
 What?
 This fullyΓÇª
 ΓÇªtrained body!
 I would cram by the likes of the Kurama ClanΓÇÖs Genjutsu!
 A pun?
 Oh?
 Are you awake?
 Hey, do you resent Kurenai Sensei for sealing your Genjutsu?!
 That person hates meΓÇª
 She didnΓÇÖt want to make me into a practitioner of Genjutsu.
 ItΓÇÖs not like that!
 ThenΓÇªwhy?!
 IΓÇÖm sure she had some kind of reason!
 You wouldΓÇÖve been in trouble had Kurenai Sensei
 not risked her life to save you before!
 That was the Kurama ClanΓÇª People from the same clan as me.
 What?
 Why would people from the same clan as youΓÇª?
 Kiba, could you take Kurenai Sensei back to the village?
 IΓÇÖm fineΓÇª I can at least do that myself.
 Kiba?!
 Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!
 Tell us the truth!
 IsnΓÇÖt this incident and you quitting our squadΓÇª
 somehow related?
 The Kurama Clan into which Yakumo was bornΓÇª
 was once a force in the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as a family of Genjutsu users.
 However, they had been brought to ruin in recent years,
 unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.
 Then a rising star brimming with talent appeared in the clan.
 And that was Yakumo.
 My parents and relatives placed their hopes in me,
 the only daughter of the head family.
 But I was in poor health and my official entrance into the Academy
 was not acknowledged.
 I had wanted to live up to the expectations
 of my parents and the clanΓÇª
 and I got really depressed.
 My father saw me like that
 and negotiated directly with the Third Hokage for me.
 The Third Hokage whom Murakumo consulted
 realized the high level of YakumoΓÇÖs latent power
 and decided to leave her in my custody.
 By the order of the Third Hokage,
 Kurenai Sensei became my personal teacher.
 ButΓÇª
 Y-Yakumo?!
 Kurenai SenseiΓÇª SheΓÇª!
 Why?!
 I don't know.
 Maybe since IΓÇÖm a Genjutsu user too,
 I got jealous of the high level of YakumoΓÇÖs latent powers.
 JealousΓÇª?!
 Genjutsu practitioners with higher powers than mine
 are not necessary in this village.
 No way. YouΓÇÖd do that for a reason like thatΓÇª?
 You understand, donΓÇÖt you?
 A selfish person like me canΓÇÖt continue to go on missions
 with your lives entrusted to me.
 I canΓÇÖt believe that!
 ItΓÇÖs not just herΓÇª IΓÇÖm a hindrance to the Leaf Village.
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I just canΓÇÖt believe it.
 IsnΓÇÖt Kurenai Sensei still hiding something from usΓÇª?
 I alsoΓÇªget that feeling.
 Exactly.
 ItΓÇÖs becauseΓÇª
 Kurenai SenseiΓÇÖs hand shook with heartache
 when she talked about events in the past.
 But the shaking stoppedΓÇª when she talked about her motive.
 What do you mean?
 That motive is a lie.
 The heart is not affected by a made-up story.
 Then her being jealous of YakumoΓÇª
 Perhaps sheΓÇÖs protecting someone.
 Someone so important Kurenai Sensei would protect?
 That would be, for exampleΓÇª
 I overheard Kurenai Sensei and the Third Hokage talking.
 YakumoΓÇÖs powers probably will not awaken for a long while.
 I see. But the time will eventually come
 when the dam bursts and her powers will pour out.
 That power of the Kurama Clan will eventually threaten
 the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 At that time, weΓÇÖll have to eliminate it.
 Even the Third Hokage was involved with the sealing of my powers.
 The Third Hokage would never order something like that!
 My parents died just before
 I started training under Kurenai Sensei.
 There was a sudden fire.
 It seems the fire spread quickly and they couldnΓÇÖt be savedΓÇª
 But my parents were even Jonin!
 To think they would die just in a fire.
 And a fire in broad daylight on top of thatΓÇª
 And after that, although I was told there was no foul playΓÇª
 the autopsy reports were classified and sealed.
 No way?! lt wasnΓÇÖt just an ordinary fire?
 My parents were killed on order of the Third HokageΓÇª!
 No wayΓÇª! No way could that ever be true!
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 The story I heard from the girl.
 The story I heard from Kurenai Sensei.
 Which one is true? ltΓÇÖs unlikely that theyΓÇÖre all lying.
 But I can say this.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way the Third Hokage would think about eliminating the girl.
 For the time being,
 IΓÇÖve got to get Sensei and the others to the hospital quick--!

 If you make one move,  this girl named Kin is dead meat!
 If you donΓÇÖt want this to end right here,
 leave your scroll and walk away!
 Once youΓÇÖve gone far enough that I canΓÇÖt feel your Chakras,
 IΓÇÖll release this girl!
 These guys... What are they grinning about?
 ΓÇô Choji! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 This isnΓÇÖt good! They wonΓÇÖt...!
 Ino!
 Uggghh. IΓÇÖm dizzy.
 W-What kind of person... hurts their own comrades?
 Careless.
 Our goal is not the scrolls or to pass this test playing by the rules.
 What?
 ItΓÇÖs Sasuke.
 Humph...
 My Jutsu...
 So your much precious Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
 is limited to 5 minutes?
 ItΓÇÖs not Shadow Paralysis. ltΓÇÖs Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 In addition, it seems that this girlΓÇÖs Jutsu...
 seems to be a Jutsu to take over the otherΓÇÖs body.
 From the looks of the blood sheΓÇÖs spitting up,
 if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...
 Are you going to do in... your teammate?
 If I need to...
 This is no good.
 Shoot...
 ThatΓÇÖs too bad... youΓÇÖre just a step away.
 YouΓÇÖre too easy-going.
 Hmph, I donΓÇÖt like this at all.
 You minor Sound Ninjas...
 Bullying the second-rate guys and putting on airs like a winner.
 What?!
 They're LeeΓÇÖs teammates...
 Lee!
 You goofed.
 Hah! Coming out of nowhere like cockroaches...
 That kid with the bob lying over there is on our team, but...
 But you messed with him, didnΓÇÖt you?!.
 WhatΓÇÖs with his eyes?
 ItΓÇÖs like they see through everything...
 If youΓÇÖre gonna continue,  IΓÇÖll fight with full strength!
 Huh?
 What ΓÇÿs wrong? Neji...
 This Chakra...
 If you donΓÇÖt like me, donΓÇÖt play cool, come down here.
 No. Evidently, thereΓÇÖs no need for that.
 After all...
 without power...
 I canΓÇÖt do anything!
 Because I had no power... Everyone was killed!
 No... You let them be killed.
 You only... watched.
 If only I had power...
 If only I had power...
 Sasuke! YouΓÇÖre awake... Huh?!
 Huh?
 ThatΓÇÖs...
 Sasuke?
 Sakura...
 Sakura...
 Who did this to you?
 Who is it?
 The Curse Marks run around his entire body?!
 Sasuke... 					That body...?
 DonΓÇÖt worry.
 On the contrary, strength is rapidly flowing in...
 Right now I feel good.
 That guy gave this to me.
 Huh?
 At last I understand...
 IΓÇÖm an Avenger...
 On my road, I must put power into my hands...
 even if it means abandoning myself to the devil.
 So... I see...
 So the mark on the neck that this girl called Sakura spoke of
 is this Curse Mark.
 But...
 I didnΓÇÖt think he could stand up...
 Sakura, tell me...
 Who harmed you...?
 Me!
 Huh?
 Ino!
 If you stay like that youΓÇÖre gonna get involved!
 Come back to this body!
 Choji, you too, come over here and hide.
 Y-Yeah.
 Uh-oh.
 Release!
 Okay, sheΓÇÖs back!
 Shikamaru!
 WhatΓÇÖs going to happen now?
 How should I know?
 Wha--?!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs this...?
 No matter...
 how you look at it....
 his Chakras are...
 too big!
 Dosu, this half-dead bastard is nothing to be scared of!
 Stop, Zaku! DonΓÇÖt you understand?!
 IΓÇÖll take care of all of them...
 in one fell swoop!
 Super Sonic Slicing Wave!
 Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.
 ΓÇô Who did? 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 Zaku!
 HeΓÇÖs fast!
 Moreover, he took in those two, and in the blink of an eye.
 Fire Style!
 Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 DonΓÇÖt push your luck!
 IΓÇÖll blow them off!
 What?!
 ShurikenΓÇÖs in the fire?!
 Zaku, below you!
 The quality of the Chakra  is completely different...
 Is that really Sasuke?
 What happened? What in the world...?
 It seems like youΓÇÖre proud of your arms...
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 Sasuke will definitely come for me.
 YouΓÇÖre the only one left.
 You...
 make it a little more fun for me.
 This isnΓÇÖt...
 This isnΓÇÖt...
 This is not like...
 Sasuke!
 S-Stop!!
 Stop it.
 Please...
 Stop.
 The Curse Mark is withdrawing...
 WeΓÇÖre saved for now.
 Sasuke!
 YouΓÇÖre strong.
 Sasuke... We canΓÇÖt defeat you the way you are now.
 This is our fee for settling this...
 Please let us withdraw from here.
 Huh?
 It seems selfish, but we now have something we need to confirm, too.
 That being said, letΓÇÖs make a promise.
 If thereΓÇÖs another opportunity to battle with you in this test,
 we wonΓÇÖt run or hide.
 Wait!
 Who in the world is Orochimaru?
 What did he do to Sasuke?!
 Why Sasuke?!
 I donΓÇÖt know...
 We were just given orders to make the hit on Sasuke.
 Though you ordered us to assassinate Sasuke,
 you got to him first.
 Moreover, you didnΓÇÖt kill him, and left that Curse Mark instead.
 I donΓÇÖt know what youΓÇÖre thinking...
 Hey! Are you okay?!
 ItΓÇÖs a pain, but Ino, IΓÇÖll leave Lee to you.
 Got it.
 That Chakra... ltΓÇÖs abnormal.
 The Uchiha clan... this good, huh?
 SakuraΓÇÖs in danger!
 ItΓÇÖs okay... IΓÇÖll protect Sakura.
 Well, what should we do with this guy?
 Kick him awake?
 Can I do it?
 What am I...?
 Sasuke...
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs up Akamaru?
 Wait a minute, Naruto, heΓÇÖs acting strange.
 What, are you hungry?
 Doesn't seem like it. How about a walk?
 I know. YouΓÇÖre looking for an electric pole, arenΓÇÖt you?

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,

 Naruto!
 There was an emergency transmission from the training room!
 What in the world happened?!
 Actually, the star was stolen.
 The enemy is a Ninja who flies using Chakra!
 No wayΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖve never heard of a flying Shinobi.
 Byakugan!
 I lost himΓÇª
 But what Naruto said is true.
 To think he can fly using ChakraΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs an incredible Shinobi.
 So it was true.
 What?! You didnΓÇÖt believe what I said?!
 You could say that.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs up with that?
 Do I have that little credibility?!
 The Remembered Lullaby
 So the star of the Village Hidden in Stars
 is a meteorite, huh?
 YesΓÇª
 The First HoshikageΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what they call the village leader.
 He discovered that if you train by the ΓÇ£starΓÇªΓÇ¥
 Chakra is strengthened.
 Ever since thenΓÇª
 the Hidden Star has been in a unique position
 even among the Ninja hidden villages.
 But it says in these documents
 that the training hasn't been conducted these past ten yearsΓÇª
 The leader who called himself the Third Hoshikage
 prohibited the trainingΓÇª
 But about a year agoΓÇª
 It seems they started again after that Hoshikage diedΓÇª
 But why? Why do something like prohibit trainingΓÇª?
 Who knowsΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs a classified matter of the Village Hidden in the Stars, soΓÇª
 But there were various rumors circulating around about itΓÇª
 Rumors?
 YeahΓÇª Rumors about most of the Ninjas who trained dyingΓÇª
 Chakra is forcibly strengthened by the power of the unknown star.
 There may have been adverse effects on the body.
 WhatΓÇª?
 The star was stolen?!
 Yes! The people who were training were at the scene,
 but they were all knocked out by an enemy JutsuΓÇª
 Pathetic!
 You say that, but that Ninja had incredible Chakra!
 Naruto, is it that incredible?
 Yeah! Turning Chakra into monsters or wings.
 ItΓÇÖs the first time I ever saw that!
 Is that trueΓÇªSumaru?
 Yes!
 ItΓÇÖs the Ninja Art: Kujaku, no mistake!
 ThatΓÇÖs the Jutsu passed on in the Village Hidden in the Stars, huh?
 YeahΓÇª As for that Jutsu, only those who have mastered the star training canΓÇª
 Sumaru!
 TentenΓÇª
 The secrets of a Jutsu are not to be spoken of or asked about lightly.
 Especially with a Jutsu that can only be passed on to those of that villageΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Lord Akahoshi, please give me an order!
 The star being stolen is my responsibility.
 NoΓÇª
 The star was stolen
 even though we were commissioned a mission to protect it.
 ItΓÇÖs also our responsibility.
 We will get the star back by our own hands, no matter what!
 YesΓÇª I will leave the search for the star to the Leaf ShinobiΓÇª
 Sumaru, you keep an eye on your injured comrades.
 But only those in the village know village mattersΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs an order!
 Hey! Are your friends who got beaten up by the enemy Ninja okay?
 ThatΓÇÖs none of your business!
 WhatΓÇª?!
 At the end of the day, youΓÇÖre still Ninja from some other village!
 YouΓÇÖre not my friends or anything!
 WhatΓÇÖs with him?!
 Neji, youΓÇÖre talking about taking responsibility,
 but we havenΓÇÖt even seen the scene of the theft.
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª And we donΓÇÖt have any leads.
 No, we do.
 You didnΓÇÖt pick up on it?
 Akahoshi the village leader knows something!
 What do you mean by knowing something?
 Come to think of it,
 when Sumaru was talking about the Kujaku something or other,
 his expression changed.
 Then that means the culprit is someone associated with this village?
 So, like I said, what does this mean?!
 IΓÇÖll make a go around the village
 and look for something that could make for a lead.
 Lee and Tenten, you keep watch over that village leader called Akahoshi.
 I understand!
 Leave it to us!
 I donΓÇÖt get it! What the heck should I do?!
 Let me seeΓÇª You investigate from SumaruΓÇÖs angle.
 All right! Leave Sumaru to me.
 Then, IΓÇÖm off for a run!
 Same as alwaysΓÇª
 Naruto sure is an impetuous person, isnΓÇÖt he?
 ΓÖ¬ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night.
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
 Swollen as I criedΓÇª
 Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
 I'm searching for a child who has gone afar
 My sad dreams come once more. ΓÖ¬
 Hey Sumaru!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 Nothing! I was just looking at the stars!
 Stars?
 Come to think of it, you can see the stars well in this village.
 That red starΓÇÖs sure prettyΓÇª
 NatsuhiboshiΓÇª
 It watches over me all the timeΓÇª
 Huh?
 H-HeyΓÇª Hold it. I want to go visit your friends.
 Look, hereΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve brought the Hidden Leaf specialty Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly!
 Go if you like! ltΓÇÖs right near the training room!
 Huh?
 A cold-hearted guy as usualΓÇª
 What? Is nobody here?
 Sorry to bother you.
 Where is everyone?
 Oh, is somebody sleeping?
 Stop itΓÇª Hokuto.
 I can tellΓÇª HeΓÇÖs not an enemy.
 MizuraΓÇª!
 You little! 145.01	01:35:28:21	01:35:32:04	Oh, ouchΓÇª
 A girlΓÇª?
 Who are you?
 IΓÇÖm a Ninja from the Village Hidden in the Leaves, Naruto Uzumaki!
 I came to this village to protect the star !
 Y-You areΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm sorry for my rough behavior!
 ItΓÇÖs cool. I just came to visitΓÇª
 WhereΓÇÖs the Roasted Chestnut Bean JellyΓÇª?
 Oh! ThatΓÇÖs it!
 Oh, no!
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistakeΓÇª
 Then it was that person who made off with the star, after allΓÇª
 So youΓÇÖre saying that oneΓÇÖs still aliveΓÇª?
 Then this will be difficult.
 That one being the final Ninja completely trained
 in the power of the star meansΓÇª
 Not an opponent we can handle with the likes of our Jutsu!
 DonΓÇÖt get flusteredΓÇª
 If the culprit is who we think it is,
 we already hold that oneΓÇÖs weakness in our hands.
 I get itΓÇª
 Then letΓÇÖs grab that person up.
 WaitΓÇª
 First we must avert the eyes of the annoying flies!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª My name is HokutoΓÇª
 I felt Chakra from someone not of this villageΓÇª
 I carelesslyΓÇª
 Well, the flavor wonΓÇÖt change, so eat up.
 OkayΓÇª
 Oh myΓÇª It really is good!
 Right? Right?
 SayΓÇª What happened to the others?
 The thief just put us to sleepΓÇª
 There wasnΓÇÖt such a great deal of damage.
 I see.
 You okay?
 Thanks for saving my butt back there!
 Is there something wrong with you?
 NoΓÇªnothing at allΓÇª
 After Mizura began the star training, he started to feel poorlyΓÇª
 Hokuto! DonΓÇÖt be talking about the star
 to someone from another village!
 Are you okay, MizuraΓÇª?!
 IΓÇÖm sorry. I got carried awayΓÇª
 Other villageΓÇª You guys are kind of cold-hearted.
 Especially that Sumaru guyΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 But thereΓÇÖs a reason why Sumaru became like that.
 What?
 It happened ten years agoΓÇª
 SumaruΓÇÖs parents who were protecting the star
 were killed by Ninja from some other villageΓÇª
 who came to steal the star.
 So probably, heΓÇÖsΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs what it was aboutΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs why he got like that.
 So where is SumaruΓÇª? And where the other guys?
 It seems everyone went to take back the star.
 Huh?!
 Oh!
 NaruΓÇªto?
 TheyΓÇÖve come out.
 RightΓÇª
 We should take them on fair and square hereΓÇª
 Idiot! ThereΓÇÖd be no point to surveillance!
 IΓÇÖm not much one for sniffing around secretly.
 Be quiet. TheyΓÇÖll notice us!
 Leave the trailing Ninjutsu to meΓÇª Follow me quietly!
 ButΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a mission!
 I understandΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs goΓÇª!
 Secretly, secretlyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okayΓÇª They havenΓÇÖt noticed.
 But I get the feeling this kind of thing goes against my Way of NinjaΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt complain!
 Secretly, secretlyΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt need to say secretly, secretly!
 But is this really a trailing Ninjutsu?
 Uh-ohΓÇª
 Have we been noticed?
 WaitΓÇª
 It appears we werenΓÇÖt noticedΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs continue trailing them!
 Right! They turned right!
 R-Roger!
 They vanishedΓÇª
 Did they give us the slip?
 Could it be, they noticed us?
 WaitΓÇª! WeΓÇÖre not enemies!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 We came here on a mission from the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Oh-ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say?
 Then arenΓÇÖt you guys trailing the wrong people?
 That might be so.
 But thereΓÇÖs the possibility that you guys have transformed
 into people from this village, soΓÇª
 Brave words.
 I apologize for the rudenessΓÇª
 But now the star has been stolen.
 And we donΓÇÖt have any leadsΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs why you were investigating us, huhΓÇª?
 That was unnecessaryΓÇª
 Oh wellΓÇª We will take back the star with our own hands.
 You guys just make sure you donΓÇÖt get in our way!
 They kind of tick me offΓÇª
 But itΓÇÖs as Neji saidΓÇª
 It seems thereΓÇÖs some kind of secret in this village, eh?
 Seems soΓÇª
 EveryoneΓÇªjoin hands!
 Listen up! Pick up the same star Chakra as us!
 There he is!
 You canΓÇÖt cut a rope woven with Chakra!
 Give back the star! ThatΓÇÖs our life!
 Neji, have you seen Sumaru and the others?
 You werenΓÇÖt keeping watch of him?
 Actually, it seems most of the guys went out to look for the star.
 I seeΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª is it okay to be all relaxed?
 Hey, is something wrong?
 ThereΓÇÖs massive Chakra at the Valley of Death.
 Did he appear again?!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 All right!
 G-Give back ourΓÇªstarΓÇª
 Give it backΓÇª
 Hold it!
 Eat this!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 Hold it!
 Farewell!
 Wh-What?!
 Damn you!
 Wait!
 Let me go! Let me go, I say!
 Calm down!
 Up ahead is the valley filled with poison gasΓÇª
 O-OkayΓÇª
 You wouldΓÇÖve been dead meat in a few seconds without that mask onΓÇª
 Damn it. We almost had him.
 So that was the Shinobi who stole the star?
 Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it!
 Why? Why is it necessary to go out of his way
 to take Sumaru away although he carried out his goal already?
 Does that have something to do
 with the star being targeted ten years ago?
 At that time, it seems SumaruΓÇÖs parents got killed protecting the star.
 What?!
 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 We need to reinvestigate the village leader and his relations.
 Please leave it to me! IΓÇÖve got an ace strategy.
 A strategy?
 I canΓÇÖt count on TentenΓÇÖs trailing Ninjutsu, can I?
 What did you say?!
 Do whatever you want. Just follow through with it.

 Thank youΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Formation!                The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!
 ItΓÇÖs already four oΓÇÖclock in the morningΓÇª
 That Fifth Hokage is a real slave driver.
 She ought to retrieve the documents she forgot herselfΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 Hey! Wake up!
 YouΓÇÖll catch cold if you sleep in a place like this.
 Thank youΓÇª
 Huh!
 Sasuke!
 Good workΓÇª
 Fifth Hokage! You were asleep just now, werenΓÇÖt you?
 When you made us go to fetch the documents!
 And only you got to sleep!
 More importantly, Lady Hokage,
 thereΓÇÖs something I want to report to you.
 What is it?
 What did you just say?!
 Is that true?!
 YesΓÇª
 According to Sakura Haruno, it appears that thereΓÇÖs no mistakeΓÇª
 UnbelievableΓÇª That they should already be on the moveΓÇª
 In addition to getting what I wantΓÇª
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf Village.
 So what that pervert wants...
 is the UchihaΓÇÖs powers, huhΓÇª
 Izumo! Kotetsu!
 ThereΓÇÖs somebody I want you to bring here!
 Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru! Your DadΓÇÖs mission starts today, too!
 ThereΓÇÖs not that much time for morning training!
 OK, OK.
 One OK is enough!
 Nag, nag, nag from early in the morningΓÇª
 I wonder who it could be so early in the morning?
 HeyΓÇªDadΓÇª
 What is it?
 Why did you marry a hard-edged woman like Mom?
 LetΓÇÖs see nowΓÇª
 Even though Mom's like that, she smiles gently sometimesΓÇª
 Maybe thatΓÇÖs whyΓÇª
 Is that the only reason?
 Shikamaru!
 A messenger of the Fifth Hokage is here.
 Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out of the village late last night.
 AndΓÇªthere is almost no mistake
 that he is headed for the Village Hidden in the Sound!
 Slipped out?! WhyΓÇª
 Because he was enticed by that Orochimaru!
 W-W-Wait a minute!
 Why does Sasuke have to be enticed by a risky guy like that?!
 The reason doesnΓÇÖt matter. ln any case, thereΓÇÖs no time.
 You will perform your first mission as a ChuninΓÇª
 So all I have to do is bring Sasuke back?
 As long as there arenΓÇÖt any enemies around,
 that shouldnΓÇÖt be too much of a hassleΓÇª
 YesΓÇª However, not only is time of the essence on this mission,
 but it may turn into something quite difficult.
 Huh?!
 There is a strong possibility that
 those under the control of Orochimaru are guiding Sasuke.
 This is turning into a real pain in the neck.
 That guyΓÇª I held him in high respect in so many different waysΓÇª
 In that case, please give me a four-man team
 composed only of Jonin and Chunin.
 IΓÇÖm afraid I canΓÇÖt do thatΓÇª
 Huh! Why?!
 You already know the answer to thatΓÇª
 Right now, only the barest minimum number of Jonin have been left behind
 and the others have all left the village on missions.
 Within the next 30 minutes,
 I want you to gather all the Genin you consider the best, and leave this village!
 ItΓÇÖs a drag butΓÇª
 I know the guy, so I just canΓÇÖt just let the matter go.
 What shall be, shall beΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs one guy I want to recommend.
 What! YouΓÇÖve gotta be kidding!
 You are such a drag starting so early in the morningΓÇª
 But why this guy?
 That jerk!
 Hey, just wait here!
 IΓÇÖll change my clothes immediately!
 So, do you have your eyeΓÇª
 on any other guys besides me who are excellent?
 YeahΓÇª
 Wake up! Hey!
 You said excellent guys, rightΓÇª
 CanΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 Potato chips?
 TheyΓÇÖre barbecued meat flavorΓÇª you help out too!
 Huh?!
 Here he comes!
 Even if it is just potato chips,
 I wonΓÇÖt let anybody else have the last piece, no matter who you are.
 Choji and I have worked as a team for many years,
 so coordinating with him is easiest for me.
 I understand that,
 but in this kind of situation, one would normally solicit Shino first!
 Oh, shut up.
 Fat chance...!
 Shino is on a special mission with his father.
 HeyΓÇªdonΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª
 Right. He's in.
 No way...!
 I seeΓÇª Sounds interestingΓÇª
 It looks like it was worth getting up early and going for a walk, doesnΓÇÖt it?
 Shikamaru, what about the other guys?
 IΓÇÖd like to take my time to look for some, but weΓÇÖre pressed for time.
 If we donΓÇÖt find anybody else by the time we leave the village,
 it will be just us!
 It appears that your operation was a success.
 YeahΓÇª
 Is it okay for you to be released already?
 I was told that I would be able to undertake light training soon.
 I seeΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a hassle, but the more people the betterΓÇª
 DamnΓÇª At a time like this, IΓÇª
 Lee! Do what you need to do.
 IΓÇÖll climb these steps alone starting tomorrow!
 LeeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll be fine! You go!
 WeΓÇÖre at our time limit!
 Well, IΓÇÖve assembled five peopleΓÇª
 All right! Everybody, follow me!
 HeyΓÇª
 Hey, NarutoΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm supposed to be the squad leader. Though it sure is a dragΓÇª
 You really think everything will be okay if things are left in your hands?
 You donΓÇÖt seem very reliableΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs up with you acting like the boss, Naruto?
 Although being ordered about by some unmotivated guy like Shikamaru
 doesnΓÇÖt sit right with me eitherΓÇª
 But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!
 We have to follow his orders.
 What that means is that the elders of the village recognized him
 as capable of being a leader.
 Since thatΓÇÖs the case, come up with some strategy and plan.
 From what I heard, there are enemies
 and thereΓÇÖs a strong possibility that theyΓÇÖre gonna ambush us.
 For a start, as this is a rescue operation,
 we will be in the position of pursuit.
 In other words, the enemy can easily gain the initiative.
 Therefore, I will decide on a deployment formation
 that will respond quickly to any assault by the enemy.
 If you ignore me and move of your own accord,
 we will all die.
 We will go in a single file formation.
 First of all, the all-important spearhead will beΓÇª
 Kiba, thatΓÇÖs you!
 You and Akamaru go on walks year round
 and are therefore well-versed in the terrain and geography of the Land of Fire.
 And since your nose is very sensitive,
 you can track Sasuke with your sense of smell and,
 you can distinguish booby traps that carry the enemyΓÇÖs scent
 which makes them easy to findΓÇª
 And moreover, you and Akamaru as a pair will be extremely efficient
 in compensating for the weakness of a single file formation to assault.
 AndΓÇªsecond in line will be me, the squad leader.
 I can give orders as required in any situation
 from my position directly behind Kiba
 and can give orders to those behind me using only hand signals.
 And in the middle... in the number three position is Naruto.
 The middle position is the best for you,
 since you're capable of executing quick moves
 and are able to respond immediately to anything in front or behind.
 You're the cornerstone... And you have Shadow Clone, too.
 And fourth in line is Choji.
 You. You don't have speed,
 but your ability to strike is the best among the squad members.
 Line leader Kiba, I, and Naruto will launch a surprise attack
 and IΓÇÖll use you to launch the deciding blow.
 In other words, your role is to attack the routed enemy.
 And then, on the tail end will be you, NejiΓÇª
 You are assigned to the most difficult position of rear lookout.
 You will use your Byakugan to constantly check
 that there are no loopholes in the ranks.
 Got it? Take a careful look at this.
 Use this diagram to verify the radius of your assigned watch.
 Kiba watches the front,
 IΓÇÖm responsible for a wide forward view,
 Naruto watches left, Choji right, and NejiΓÇª
 Using your Byakugan, you cover the entire area to the rear.
 I want to familiarize myself with our current military potential.
 Let me check all the Ninja equipment each of you currently hasΓÇª
 I will commit that to memory straight away.
 Any questions?
 Even though he just assembled his men a short while ago,
 heΓÇÖs already created the best possible formationΓÇª
 If not, I want to tell you the most important thing last.
 Sasuke and I arenΓÇÖt close friends.
 In fact, I donΓÇÖt particularly like him.
 However, he is also a Shinobi belonging to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 He is a comrade!
 Therefore, I will put my life on the line to help him!
 ThatΓÇÖs the way of the Leaf Village.
 In this case, even I canΓÇÖt just sit back and be a sluggard.
 Because I am responsible for your lives.
 WowΓÇª YouΓÇÖre acting kind of like a Chunin, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 Okay then, as soon as he's checked our Ninja tools, weΓÇÖll depart.
 Everybody, take out your Ninja tools.
 Sasuke wouldnΓÇÖt fall victim to that kind of guyΓÇÖs enticementΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs already a really powerful guy,
 so he wouldnΓÇÖt need to do that kind of thing! I guarantee it!
 DamnΓÇª Why, SasukeΓÇª?!
 All right! LetΓÇÖs go!
 Wait!
 Sakura!
 I heard the whole story from Lady Hokage.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, but I canΓÇÖt take you along on this mission.
 Even you werenΓÇÖt able to convince Sasuke, right?
 All that can be done now is for us to use force to convince himΓÇª
 Sakura, your role in this has ended.
 Which means, Sakura, that you and SasukeΓÇª?!
 SakuraΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª This is aΓÇª once in a lifetime request...
 Please bringΓÇª please bring Sasuke back.
 I couldnΓÇÖt do it! I wasnΓÇÖt able to stop Sasuke!
 At this point, the only person who would be able to stop SasukeΓÇª
 who would be able to save himΓÇª
 is youΓÇªNarutoΓÇª
 You like Sasuke so much, donΓÇÖt you, Sakura?
 I understand to my very core
 how painful it must be for you right now, Sakura.
 Sakura, thereΓÇÖs one thing I want to ask you.
 Huh?
 How do you feel aboutΓÇªNaruto?
 Thwarting someoneΓÇÖs love seems to have become natural to him.
 He actually seems to be enjoying my suffering.
 Naruto doesnΓÇÖt understand the least thing about me.
 HeΓÇÖs just annoying.
 NarutoΓÇªthank youΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll bring Sasuke back without fail! I promise that on my life!
 You always understood meΓÇª
 You always helped meΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 Hey, hey, Naruto!
 You really think youΓÇÖre gonna be okay saying that kind of thing?!
 Sure! I will not go back on my word.
 ThatΓÇÖs my Way of the Ninja!
 All right! LetΓÇÖs hurry up and go!
 WeΓÇÖve lost a little timeΓÇª LetΓÇÖs hurry!
 OK!
 Naruto struck the pose of a nice guy as he said thatΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll all be all right now.
 IΓÇÖm positiveΓÇª IΓÇÖm positive that it will all go well!
 Master SasukeΓÇª Around here will do, donΓÇÖt you think?
 WeΓÇÖve already exited the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 What is that?
 To tell you the truth,
 Orochimaru has given us one important taskΓÇª
 SoΓÇªwhat is it?
 It will be necessary for you to die onceΓÇª
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 From here on up, there's more danger of traps and ambushes.
 ΓÇô Stay alert and use all your senses. ΓÇô Roger that!
 ΓÇô Find the enemy before he gets you. ΓÇô You can count on me!
 ΓÇô And any signs of the enemy-- ΓÇô Right!
 Say, are you listening?!
 Not to worry. No matter who the enemy may be,
 I'll thrash him with my new technique!
 I'm a fool to even attempt to explain.

 A Dubious Offer! Tsunade's Choice
 Not goodΓÇª
 Dang it! Dang it! This time for sureΓÇªno matter what!
 YouΓÇÖre the only one who can treat Lord OrochimaruΓÇÖs arms.
 Why donΓÇÖt we make a deal?
 IΓÇÖll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you lovedΓÇª
 with the Forbidden Jutsu IΓÇÖve developed.
 DonΓÇÖt you want to see those two, TsunadeΓÇª?
 No! You must not believe in their sweet talkΓÇª
 Their wishesΓÇª Moreover, Tsunade, your wishesΓÇª
 And dreamsΓÇª Did you forget them?!
 IΓÇÖll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demanded that you become the Fifth Hokage.
 The successive line of Hokages
 have protected the Leaf Village and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control
 and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives for this dream, this ideal!
 You donΓÇÖt have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Also, two human sacrifices are needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,
 so do what you need to do to prepare them.
 We are starting!
 CΓÇÖmon. Place your bets!
 Which will you bet on, maΓÇÖam?
 Which one? CΓÇÖmon!
 Which one will she choose?
 If she agrees to our conditions,
 your arms will be healed,
 and the destruction of the Leaf Village will continue immediately.
 Lady Tsunade will also be able to be reunited with the two whom she loves.
 But if she doesnΓÇÖt agreeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll have to force her to heal my armsΓÇª
 Will it really be that easy?
 I have you.
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to worry.
 IΓÇÖm the one who knows her the best.
 And her greatest weakness!
 SheΓÇÖll definitely accept the conditionsΓÇª Definitely!
 Listen, in this third step,
 youΓÇÖve got to use 100% of what you have learnedΓÇª
 And retain them.
 In other words,
 imagine creating a single layer within the balloon
 and compressing the Chakra inside it.
 I know that in my headΓÇª
 But no matter what,
 I canΓÇÖt completely hold 100% of my power in a neat ballΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt give him false hope by teaching him something he can't master.
 ThatΓÇÖs why the moony kid starts joking about becoming a Hokage!
 Tomorrow, huh.
 Come again, okay?
 I certainly will!
 Are you going to meet Orochimaru again?
 To think sheΓÇÖd be that shaken upΓÇª
 Something extreme must have happened.
 That one week bugs me, somehowΓÇª
 And Naruto hasnΓÇÖt come back to the inn for nearly a week.
 I guess IΓÇÖll press Tsunade a little more.
 No goodΓÇª
 No goodΓÇª Why?
 Here thereΓÇÖs no timeΓÇª ltΓÇÖll be too late.
 WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?!
 What happened, Naruto?!
 Are you okay?
 What do you want?
 The moonΓÇÖs out.
 How about going out for a drink?
 Tomorrow will be the one week you promised to Naruto.
 I wonder what became of Naruto?
 Beats me.
 I guess IΓÇÖll have something.
 Radish, please.
 Coming up.
 Oh?
 Here you go.
 Ooh! This looks good.
 Lady Tsunade!
 What happened to Naruto?
 HeΓÇÖs quite exhausted and weakened.
 And his right hand is severely burned with ChakraΓÇª
 As it stands now,
 this kid probably wonΓÇÖt wake up until the day after tomorrow.
 ItΓÇÖs as Jiraiya saysΓÇª
 Why did I make such a stupid bet?
 What am I, of all people, getting so worked up for?
 How stupid.
 TomorrowΓÇª
 Please donΓÇÖt go tomorrow!
 Why donΓÇÖt you say anything?!
 Lady Tsunade! Please donΓÇÖt be silent. Please answer!
 If you say that youΓÇÖre goingΓÇª
 What will you do?
 IΓÇÖll stop you with my life!
 ShizuneΓÇª Have you forgotten who youΓÇÖre talking to?
 Sir! ItΓÇÖs morning, now! ltΓÇÖs about time you went home!
 Geez.
 Hey! Get up, sirΓÇª
 Hey! WhatΓÇÖs wrong, you?!
 ItΓÇÖll be troublesome if weΓÇÖre disturbed during the negotiationsΓÇª
 What do you want me to do?
 It might be good to killΓÇª TsunadeΓÇÖs attendant.
 It seems that youΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt trust me completelyΓÇªyet.
 Precisely because I trust youΓÇª
 I would like to leave Sasuke in your hands.
 Well, thenΓÇª
 KabutoΓÇª
 If you wish to stop meΓÇª
 You have no choice but to kill young Sasuke, now.
 You canΓÇÖt possibly kill meΓÇª
 Hey!
 I said hey!
 NarutoΓÇª?
 Oh no! What time is it? No, what day is it?
 ItΓÇÖs MondayΓÇª
 What is it?
 Is your body okay?
 As I recall, you were supposed to sleep for two full daysΓÇª
 No matter what the wound,
 IΓÇÖm always able to recover if I sleep one night!
 ThatΓÇÖs right. This kid has Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇÖs powerΓÇª
 More importantly, whereΓÇÖs that stupid old woman?!
 TodayΓÇÖs the promised bet day.
 Then, what about the JutsuΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs still not complete, but I can wing itΓÇª Believe it!
 ThatΓÇÖs right. This isnΓÇÖt the time for this.
 ΓÇô Naruto, please stayΓÇª ΓÇô Huh?
 You areΓÇª!
 What?! Oh!
 Wait, Shizune!
 That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.
 I canΓÇÖt build up my Chakra wellΓÇª
 And my body is so numb, I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.
 What was he gonna do if that had hit me?!
 ThatΓÇÖs lame! Here youΓÇÖre always bragging about how youΓÇÖre this awesome Ninja!
 And youΓÇÖre nailed by her perverted attack? You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!
 Shut up!
 Even if sheΓÇÖs rotten, sheΓÇÖs still a medical specialist.
 SheΓÇÖs the only one who could concoct a tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.
 But to think IΓÇÖd be caught off-guard,
 no matter how intoxicated I wasΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going to kill you, bastard!
 How are you feeling, Master Jiraiya?
 Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.
 But be that as it may, maybe around thirty percentΓÇª
 I never thought IΓÇÖd end up encountering that Master Jiraiya in a place like thisΓÇª
 Things have gotten difficult. I guess IΓÇÖll pull back for now.
 At any rate, NarutoΓÇª To think youΓÇÖd be here, tooΓÇª
 Hey! Shizune.
 Y-Yes?!
 ItΓÇÖs about time you tell me
 what the heck she was talking about with Orochimaru.
 Orochimaru?!
 I wanted to believe Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why I couldnΓÇÖt say until now.
 ButΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no time. Please come with me!
 IΓÇÖll explain as we run!
 Okay!
 IΓÇÖm going, too!
 WhatΓÇÖs your answer?
 Say what?!
 The answer to that is definitely no!
 This might be really badΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs probably still thinking of those two.
 Perhaps I may have no choice, but to kill TsunadeΓÇª
 Dang it!
 IΓÇÖll heal your armsΓÇª
 In exchange for that, keep your hands off the village.
 Very well.
 Now thenΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs planning to once again attack
 the Leaf Village if his arms are healed!
 The situation will get even more dangerous than that
 if heΓÇÖs not stopped now.
 Him screwing around like that!
 I have you. ThereΓÇÖs no need to worryΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this?
 To think youΓÇÖd betray me at this pointΓÇª
 Tsunade!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥

 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 What the hell is this?! This castle has been destroyed even further!
 It seems Tsunade has declined the deal.
 ButΓÇªbut the old lady is not here!
 Calm down a second. She shouldn't have gone far from here.

 Yeah, we went to the trouble of leaving footprints as we go.

 As for the extra two, we'll leave one for each respectively

 connected by an iron wire going through the center.
 Like a Bamboo Snake? How nostalgic.
 I used one a lot with puppet games when I was a kid.
 It can look like a living snake depending on how itΓÇÖs controlled.
 But thereΓÇÖs no point once itΓÇÖs been identified.

 I was being cautious, but he is much too strong.
 Gaara Sensei!
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect from Gaara of the Sand.
 HeΓÇÖs not called the ultimate weapon for nothingΓÇª
 The ultimateΓÇªweapon?!
 However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools
 forged in the Village of the Artisans!
 Gaara!
 Hey, heΓÇÖs totally got the edge!
 Do we have a chance to return the favor?
 ThatΓÇÖs incredible wind. What an amount of ChakraΓÇª
 No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra.
 So sheΓÇÖs relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh?
 Anyway, weΓÇÖve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu
 and stop her movements!
 Right.
 LetΓÇÖs go at once!
 Annoying!
 SheΓÇÖs attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari.
 I see.
 So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and
 blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind
 before we can get close, huhΓÇª?
 Now then, what should we do?
 Man Beast Clone!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Crow!
 ΓÇô Arms! 					ΓÇô Fang Over Fang!
 Did you guys come to get in my way?!
 We made sure to send you a signal, right?!
 How could I tell?!
 We donΓÇÖt click at all?
 Are you guysΓÇªmessing around?!
 Be more serious and die!
 Talking nonsense!
 Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, stillΓÇª
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect of Gaara,
 the SandΓÇÖs ultimate weapon who hosts the ShukakuΓÇª
 But youΓÇÖre already in our hands.
 What should I do? SheΓÇÖs beyond the range of my JutsuΓÇª
 and I donΓÇÖt see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow.
 Hey!
 WhatΓÇÖre you whispering about?
 WhatΓÇÖre you thinking?!
 IΓÇÖll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not?
 I suppose I could try, butΓÇª
 What is itΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs he doing?
 Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created.
 WhatΓÇÖs this Chakra?
 This is a water vein!
 I get it!
 The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isnΓÇÖt a BarrierΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a water vein!
 Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale FormationΓÇª Activate!
 Oh no!
 Gaara Sensei!
 The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start!
 Our swords accurately pierce a water vein
 and summon the water dragon.
 Sand has sucked up a large amount of water
 and has become as heavy as leadΓÇª
 Now Gaara can no longer use sand.
 Gaara!
 ΓÇô Gaara! 					ΓÇô Calm down!
 Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!
 That guy is?!
 TheyΓÇÖll save Gaara, no matter what.
 We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us.
 To think youΓÇÖd choose a sandy area to fall onΓÇª
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect of Gaara of the desertΓÇª
 However!
 ThatΓÇÖs as far as your useless resistance goes!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 A heroΓÇÖs turn always comes late!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!
 NarutoΓÇª!
 It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incidentΓÇª
 This time weΓÇÖve come to return the favor from that time.
 So weΓÇÖll take that guy on!
 You hurry to your student straight on!
 To think heΓÇÖd corner you this farΓÇª
 ΓÇô Lee! 					ΓÇô Sakura!
 Leave GaaraΓÇÖs treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto!
 ΓÇô Sakura! 					ΓÇô Got it!
 Then IΓÇÖll be going first!
 Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!
 IΓÇÖll suck up all of your Chakra!
 I see. So this means we canΓÇÖt release our regular power?
 That doesnΓÇÖt matter!
 Even without Chakra, weΓÇÖve got fighting spirit!
 Yes! WeΓÇÖll go with that plus willpower!
 Just as I thought.
 That they havenΓÇÖt launched anything during the fight thus far means
 the two reinforcements donΓÇÖt have long range-type Jutsu.
 Then IΓÇÖll maintain this distance andΓÇª
 youΓÇÖll die getting torn up by the wind!
 While sheΓÇÖs distracted by Shikamaru and the others,
 IΓÇÖll just go for it!
 Mind DestructionΓÇª!
 Ino!
 Foolish girl. ItΓÇÖs useless to attempt to exploit an opening!
 You little!
 You wonΓÇÖt get close to me! IΓÇÖve read your range as well!
 I donΓÇÖt know about thatΓÇª!
 Ino! You stay right there!
 IΓÇÖm counting on youΓÇª!
 Shino! Sakura!
 ThereΓÇÖs one wounded at the waterfall.
 Tunneling Fang!
 Now!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 OhΓÇª!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 Are you guysΓÇªmocking me?
 After sucking up all of your Chakra, IΓÇÖll be returning the favor plenty!
 The contusion treatment is complete.
 But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming.
 Contact from your friendsΓÇª?
 ΓÇô InoΓÇÖs hurt?! 					ΓÇô Go!
 Wha--?! But in your conditionΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm okay now. Help your friend!
 Okay. DonΓÇÖt push yourself.
 YeahΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade!
 IΓÇÖll help my comrade.
 IΓÇÖll settle this in a moment.
 ButΓÇª
 Bushy Brow!
 Damn it. ItΓÇÖs no good just shot-gunning it!
 ItΓÇÖs just him?
 A part of Black AntΓÇª
 Could it beΓÇªa signal?
 Fang Over Fang once more!
 Back me up with Crow!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you for back up too, Choji!
 Got it!
 Heh! Bossing me around.
 The counterattack starts now!
 ItΓÇÖs futile. Your Jutsu wonΓÇÖt reach me!
 You never know until you try, rightΓÇª?!
 Here we go!
 Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!
 Huh?!
 WhatΓÇÖre you aiming at?! Totally misguidedΓÇª
 Say what?
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this?
 IΓÇÖm sure IΓÇÖd read your range alreadyΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖll show you!
 I can create a shadow with this thick a current
 even if the waterΓÇÖs clear.
 My JutsuΓÇÖs range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall!
 The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
 SummoningΓÇª
 Blade Dance!
 This oneΓÇÖs done!
 Good griefΓÇª
 IΓÇªcouldnΓÇÖt do anything.
 Here everyoneΓÇÖs doing their bestΓÇª
 Only IΓÇª
 Ino?
 Gaara.
 You donΓÇÖt have any sand left you can use.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 He smashed the Sand Armor.
 No way! But the sand heavy with water like thatΓÇª
 If I just suck up the ChakraΓÇª
 This is my weapon!
 You okay, Gaara?!
 This is the finishing blowΓÇª
 Gaara Sensei!
 Hurry! Leave the rest to us!
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Annoying buzzing flies!
 Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!
 What?!
 Oh, no!
 Puppet ShowΓÇª
 Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
 The showΓÇÖs  over!
 ΓÇô We did it! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 Matsuri.
 Gaara andΓÇª!
 A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.
 HeΓÇÖs heading for the valley.
 The last oneΓÇª
 Gaara is chasing him!
 What?!
 You okay, Bushy Brow? Sakura will be right back.
 Thanks.
 Well, IΓÇÖm going after Gaara!
 Got it! IΓÇÖll meet up with you later!
 IΓÇÖve got him cornered.
 Matsuri.
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 I heard you figured out the identities of the Four Celestials?
 Yes. They are the Ninja of the Village of the Artisans
 who've been harboring ill feeling toward the Five Great Nations.
 It seems theyΓÇÖve completed the forbidden project
 passed down in the village and
 intend to resurrect their ultimate weapon.
 I see. I take it the other villagers got wind of it and evacuated.
 Exactly. You head over to where they are immediately.
 Yes, maΓÇÖam.

 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 What is it?
 Who are you?!
 It was youΓÇª? You killed him, didnΓÇÖt you?
 N-NoΓÇª I donΓÇÖt know anythingΓÇª!
 The Cursed WarriorΓÇª?
 The Cursed Warrior
 Old manΓÇÖsΓÇªsnot!
 I just canΓÇÖt get myself into training doing it aloneΓÇª
 I wonder if we wonΓÇÖt get a mission connected to Sasuke or something.
 The Land of Birds? From such a remote landΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs whatΓÇÖs troubling us.
 The ΓÇ£Cursed WarriorΓÇ¥ apparition has been disturbing the castle town
 and misleading the public, huh?
 So they want us to exterminate a ghost?
 I declined once saying we canΓÇÖt go so far
 as to accept the extermination of a ghost, butΓÇª
 I must have you accept this at any cost. Please accept!
 Is it because the money isnΓÇÖt enough?
 We in the Land of Birds are experiencing financial difficulties.
 Even this is the very limit the budget will allowΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not an issue of money.
 In other words, itΓÇÖs the mission details.
 Be that as it may,
 indeed there isnΓÇÖt even enough to cover travel expenses with this amountΓÇª
 Now that things have come to this passΓÇª
 I shall commit harakiriΓÇª!
 DonΓÇÖt be hasty!
 Yikes!
 ItΓÇÖs the little bit of pocket money I have saved up.
 IΓÇÖll pay out of my own pocket. So with this, pleaseΓÇª!
 And thatΓÇÖs why you accepted it?
 ItΓÇÖs indulgent even for meΓÇª
 Nonetheless, most of the Jonin and Chunin are out on missions.
 I was thinking of how to handle thisΓÇª
 I guess someoneΓÇÖs talking about you.
 EveryoneΓÇÖs busy with missions, so they donΓÇÖt have time for such things.
 WhoΓÇÖs that guyΓÇª?
 HeΓÇÖs been like that since earlier.
 Even tasty ramen wonΓÇÖt go down the throat right being watched like that!
 Come inside and eat if youΓÇÖre hungry!
 No, IΓÇÖm not hungryΓÇª
 So? Tasty, huh?
 Yes!
 Thanks for your business.
 Come back and have Naruto treat you againΓÇª
 Again and again like that? Give me a break.
 Thank you for treating me. ln appreciationΓÇª
 N-No, you donΓÇÖt need to worry about itΓÇª
 But hey, whatΓÇÖs your name?
 YouΓÇÖre not a familiar face from this villageΓÇª
 Yes, my name is Chishima and I have come from the Land of Birds.
 I came to the Village Hidden in the Leaves to commission a missionΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre flat broke even though you came as a messenger of your land?
 There wasnΓÇÖt enough money for the commission,
 so I even used up my own pocket moneyΓÇª
 Then it must be a very important mission, huh?
 It might even cost an important friend of mineΓÇÖs very lifeΓÇª
 Your friendΓÇª? What the heck do you mean?
 Ever since I was little,
 I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi, the feudal lord of the Land of BirdsΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre friends with a feudal lord?!
 I said feudal lord,
 but he was only just appointed last year and actually heΓÇÖs the same age as me.
 No kidding? Then heΓÇÖs a totally young feudal lord.
 Y-YesΓÇª The previous feudal lord, his father Lord Owashi died from illness
 and after that he even lost his twin sisterΓÇª
 Ever since then,
 Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful, has become a totally different personΓÇª
 He wouldnΓÇÖt show his face even if I visitedΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm worried about him as a friend rather than a feudal lord.
 I was thinking something might have happened to himΓÇª
 So if there is something I can do,
 I want to do whatever I can, as a friendΓÇª
 I couldnΓÇÖtΓÇªsave Sasuke. But this guyΓÇÖs stillΓÇª
 Leave it to me.
 What?
 LetΓÇÖs save your friend!
 Right!
 Old Lady Tsunade! YouΓÇÖre mean!
 Listen, you could at least knock when entering my office.
 More importantly! What do you mean by fleecing bro of his pocket money
 and then not accepting the mission?!
 Huh?
 People call stuff like that devilish! You old lady devil!
 Try saying that again!
 IΓÇÖm sorry!
 I wonder if NarutoΓÇªis okayΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖll be fine.
 YouΓÇÖve gotten to know a good guyΓÇª
 He may not look it, but heΓÇÖs quite dependable.
 What?!
 R-RightΓÇª
 Who said I wouldnΓÇÖt accept the mission?
 Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Neji to finish his mission and come back.
 Half-cocked jerk.
 Lee is on a mission with Guy.
 You and Tenten will form a three-man team with Neji as the leader, got it?
 Then did you hear from that kid about the mission details?
 Well actually, not yetΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the extermination of a ghost.
 A ghost?
 It seems that it appears when youΓÇÖre walking through town at nightΓÇª
 A ghost clad in white armor.
 ThatΓÇÖs what youΓÇÖllΓÇª
 I-I didnΓÇÖt hear anything about a ghostΓÇª
 Are you scared of it?
 IΓÇÖm not scared. I couldnΓÇÖt be a Ninja if I got scared at stuff like that!
 But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts?
 Who knowsΓÇª?
 Try testing it out yourself.
 Jeez, why didnΓÇÖt you say at the start
 that it was a commission to exterminate a ghost?!
 I didnΓÇÖt tell you?
 Not even a word. But thatΓÇÖs just a rumor anyway, right?
 I havenΓÇÖt seen it, butΓÇª
 See?
 But it seems my master, Lord Moso, saw it close up.
 F-For real?!
 The Land of Birds, huhΓÇª? ThatΓÇÖs sure farΓÇª
 Village Hidden in the Leaves
 Land of Birds
 Umm, is there moreΓÇª?
 You sure eat a lot considering youΓÇÖre thin.
 IΓÇÖm sorry. IΓÇÖm often called a skinny voracious eater.
 Hey, by the way, is there really such a thing as the Cursed Warrior?
 There are people who say
 itΓÇÖs the disembodied spirit of the previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi.
 The disembodied spirit of a dead feudal lordΓÇª
 Rather than ghosts,
 tell us a little more about the Land of Birds.
 SureΓÇª
 The capitol of the Land of Birds stretches across the banks of the lake
 where migratory birds restΓÇª
 It was a peaceful town with lots of green
 and where water from the lake would be drawn into the canalsΓÇª
 However, after the sudden death of the previous feudal lord,
 there was much uproar.
 His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei, the tactician from previously,
 were nominated to be the next feudal lordΓÇª
 But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagi was still too young
 and was vehemently opposed to him assuming the feudal lordship.
 But in the end, Lord Sagi took the seat of feudal lord
 and the matter was closed with Moso the high priest
 providing tutelage as a superintendent officialΓÇª
 However, before even half a year passed,
 Lady Toki, his twin sister, died suddenlyΓÇª
 After that, Lord Sagi who was so cheerful
 turned into a totally different person, became coldhearted
 and he now conducts governmental matters confined in his mansionΓÇª
 From about that time,
 the ΓÇ£Cursed WarriorΓÇ¥ began appearing in the castle townΓÇª
 Those in the castle town say that Lord Owashi was killed by someoneΓÇª
 There are even those who say that the Cursed Warrior
 is the ghost of Lord Owashi searching for the person
 who drove him to death and is attempting to have his revengeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs scaryΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no such thing as ghosts.
 ButΓÇª
 That priest Moso is the one
 who gained the most from OwashiΓÇÖs death, huhΓÇª?
 Lord Moso is a magnificent person of virtue with no self-interests!
 Then the suspicious one isΓÇª
 The only one left is Komei the tactician!
 I bet he assassinated Owashi
 in an attempt to become the feudal lord, but failed!
 He has complained whenever opportunity offered itself,
 after Lord Sagi became the feudal lord as well!
 A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagi by starting the rumor
 about the Cursed Warrior might be a piece of cake for Lord KomeiΓÇª!
 All right! ThereΓÇÖs no doubt.
 ItΓÇÖs settled. The true identity of the Cursed Warrior is Komei!
 The true identity of the ghost is revealed, huhΓÇª?
 Lord Komei, there was nothing unusual on the scheduled patrol.
 You may step downΓÇª
 Yes, sire.
 ArenΓÇÖt we at our destination yet?!
 Just a little further until Lord MosoΓÇÖs residence.
 Where is he?! This way?
 Where did he go?!
 Th-There he is!
 Get him! Drag him down!
 Cursed Warrior!
 He vanished.
 Lord Komei! Are you all right?!
 IΓÇÖm fine. DonΓÇÖt panic!
 WhatΓÇÖs that?!
 ItΓÇÖs flying?!
 Clad in white armor, possesses a halberd,
 and wears a mask with a frightening lookΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no doubtΓÇª ltΓÇÖs the Cursed Warrior!
 After him!
 Are you going to ride on my shoulders forever?
 Wait here! IΓÇÖll pin down the true identity of the ghost!
 Huh? R-RightΓÇª
 WhereΓÇÖd he go?!
 Over there!
 Byakugan!
 I canΓÇÖt see himΓÇª
 What does that mean?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no human presence in hereΓÇª
 At least, a living presenceΓÇª
 Wh-Why do you put it that wayΓÇª?
 Shh! DidnΓÇÖt you hear something just now?
 I thought you didnΓÇÖt feel a human presence!
 I told youΓÇªliving presence.
 Wh-What do you want?!
 Damn it, damn it.
 You little!
 Chain Weight!
 Th-There canΓÇÖt be something like ghosts. No such things as ghosts!
 Stop, Naruto! HeΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 U!
 Zu!
 Ma!
 Ki!
 Naruto Barrage!
 Yes!  Now IΓÇÖll verify the true identity!
 This isΓÇª
 The insides are empty.
 That meansΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs a real ghost!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 So thatΓÇÖs Sagi, the feudal lord of this land, huh?
 HeΓÇÖs far away, but he might be quite cool.
 Shh, be quiet!
 What is it, Neji?
 SomethingΓÇÖs strange. WhatΓÇÖs with this blood thirst?
 What? Bloodthirsty? Could it be assassins?
 They might be Shinobi. ls everyone ready?!
 ΓÇô Yeah. 					ΓÇô Yeah.
 IΓÇÖll protect the feudal lord!

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away

 Are you going to run away from me?!
 YoΓÇªloser.
 A Cry on Deaf Ears
 ItΓÇÖs you this time, huh?
 I couldnΓÇÖt do it. I was not able to stop SasukeΓÇª
 I thinkΓÇª the one who can stop SasukeΓÇª
 the one who can save Sasuke isΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇªyou are the only one.
 NarutoΓÇªthis is myΓÇª once in a lifetimeΓÇªfavor to askΓÇª
 PleaseΓÇª Please bring Sasuke back!
 I also told this to Sakura, butΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt mind me anymore.
 What's with that face?
 Iruka Sensei, why on the earth does an outstanding person like me
 have to be on the same team with him?
 Sasuke graduated with the highest grade out of all studentsΓÇª
 Naruto, you are at the bottom!
 When you even out the teamΓÇÖs strength,
 then it naturally becomes like this.
 Try your best not to slow me down, you dunce.
 I am fine without eating! I am absolutely fine.
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªfineΓÇª
 Here.
 You asked Sakura for a hint the other day, what did she tell you?
 Shall we go?
 Yup.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs with that faceΓÇª?
 You loserΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª?
 YouΓÇª I hated you, you know.
 ItΓÇÖs none of your business!
 Who knows, my body moved on its own.
 You rescue Sakura, no matter what!
 SasukeΓÇª YouΓÇª
 I could still distract him for a little whileΓÇª
 I lost everything once.
 I donΓÇÖt want to see my precious comrades die in front of me anymore.
 WhyΓÇª?
 Why is itΓÇªSasuke?
 Why did you become like this?!
 You!
 Whatever happens to me, what does that have to do with you?
 I have my own way.
 No matter who it is,
 nobody has the right to tell me what to do.
 I will tell you the truth.
 IΓÇÖm done fooling around with you guys of the Leaf.
 Go home.
 IΓÇÖll take care of him!
 ChojiΓÇª
 Go everyone!
 Go, quickly! IΓÇÖll catch up with you.

 You also promised Sakura with a Nice-Guy pose, Naruto.
 Bushy BrowΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll defeat this person.
 ItΓÇÖs a promise.
 EveryoneΓÇª
 Everyone risked their lives to come after you, you know!
 Good job for them.
 Lastly, I will tell you the most important thing.
 Sasuke is neither a close friend of mine nor is he someone I like.
 But Sasuke is a Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the LeavesΓÇª
 A comrade.
 ThatΓÇÖs why we will rescue him by risking our lives.
 This is the Leaf way.
 How do you take your comrades of the Leaf ?!
 Comrades, you saidΓÇª
 Did I become stronger staying with those so-called comrades?
 I am going to where Orochimaru is.
 Orochimaru is the person who killed the Third Hokage
 and tried to crush The Leaf Village!
 Do you think he will give you the power freely?
 He just wants your body as a vessel!
 You might not be able to come back. You might get killed.
 You think IΓÇÖd easily let you go to such a place?!
 That doesnΓÇÖt matter to meΓÇª
 If my goal is accomplished, then thatΓÇÖs all that matters.
 If you intend to get in that wayΓÇª
 Then it canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre not gonna be able to! IΓÇÖll take you back even by force!
 Why are you laughing?!
 You were laughing at that time too.
 That timeΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs funny?
 ItΓÇÖs not funny. I am happy.
 Thinking aboutΓÇª how I can finally defeat you here.
 That time you wanted to fight me, right?
 You were thrilled werenΓÇÖt you?
 At first!
 But, you were different.
 That wasΓÇª
 Hurry up and come.
 But first, put on your Headband. IΓÇÖll wait.
 I donΓÇÖt need such a thingΓÇª
 Just put it on!
 You wonΓÇÖt be able to put one scratch on my face.
 ThatΓÇÖs not it!
 IΓÇÖm saying that this is a sign that we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.
 That is what I call a stuck up!
 You think you and I are equal?
 Yeah, I think so.
 IΓÇÖve never thought I was inferior to you.
 YouΓÇÖre so obnoxious!
 Stop!
 That wasΓÇª
 That was not the kind of fight I wanted.
 Even nowΓÇªthis is notΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt care about your circumstances.
 WhatΓÇªis this power?
 Power is flowing outΓÇª
 So this is the power that the guy was talking about.
 Furthermore, the power is growing into my body.
 If it is like that nowΓÇª if I release this curse markΓÇª
 I wonder how much powerΓÇª
 Wh-What powerΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs not the same as beforeΓÇª
 Wake up already!
 I awakened long agoΓÇª
 From my idiotic self who dreams about a lax peaceful futureΓÇª
 hanging out with comrades.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I left the village!
 ThatΓÇÖs why I sought power!
 My dream is not in the future.
 My dream is in the pastΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the only place it exists.
 Wow, Brother!
 You hit the target right in the middle, even the one behind the rock!
 All right, me too!
 Sasuke, letΓÇÖs go home.
 GeezΓÇª You said that you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.
 There is an important mission tomorrow and I need to prepare for that.
 LiarΓÇª
 Forgive me, SasukeΓÇª Another time.
 Brother, watch me!
 Hey! If you push yourselfΓÇª
 Why is the one who twisted his ankle laughing?
 Could it be that you are trying to take the easy way?
 ThatΓÇÖs not true...
 IΓÇÖm happy thinking about
 how IΓÇÖm finally going to the Academy starting tomorrow.
 IΓÇÖm going to do my best when I enter the Academy.
 So even that father will approve of me.
 He will count on me like he does on my brotherΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª You really areΓÇª
 I told youΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt need a future with you guys anymore.

 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you donΓÇÖt feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 ButΓÇª
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I feel power surging through my bodyΓÇª
 It's as though I can't lose.
 It's power I'd never have gained playing comrade with you guys from Leaf.
 But it's not enough. lt's way short of enough, Naruto!
 StrengthΓÇªhatredΓÇªand desire!

130,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so donΓÇÖt hide your fists
 YouΓÇÖre not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 DonΓÇÖt forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 With this, youΓÇÖve woken up, right?
 We had a hindrance back thenΓÇª
 but it wonΓÇÖt be like that this time.
 IΓÇÖll show youΓÇª the true power of Sharingan.
 FineΓÇªThen IΓÇÖll go all out too!
 You take a good look with your SharinganΓÇª
 at my Way of Ninja!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You canΓÇÖt beat me by just pointlesslyΓÇª increasing the number!
 You little--!
 I can spot the real body in one shot with my Sharingan.
 I deliberately went along with your gameΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt go easy on you now!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father-Son:                        The Broken Crest
 What was upΓÇª with those eyes of Big BrotherΓÇÖs?
 That wasnΓÇÖtΓÇª just an ordinary Sharingan.
 AndΓÇªquite a bit of timeΓÇÖs passed since thenΓÇª
 but things are still kind of awkward between him and Father.
 Good morning, FatherΓÇª
 Yeah, good morning.
 SasukeΓÇª how have things been going at the Academy lately?
 ItΓÇÖs boring with just school classes.
 IΓÇÖm always number one, soΓÇª
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 W-WowΓÇª
 This is the fundamental Jutsu of the Uchiha.
 The Sign is as I taught you earlier.
 You build up Chakra,
 stop it once at around between the mouth and the chest area,
 and spew it out at once after that.
 Try it.
 Okay!
 FatherΓÇªis teaching me Jutsu himself.
 FinallyΓÇª Father has also recognized me!
 I must live up to his expectations!
 I too canΓÇª!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it wonΓÇÖt go like it did with Itachi, huh?
 It mightΓÇÖve still been too soon for you.
 A member of the Uchiha Clan is not recognized as full-fledged
 until they can use the Fire Style.
 The Uchiha crestΓÇª
 means those who possess the Uchiha that controls fire.
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Today for sure!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 Wait a minute.
 What is it?
 WhatΓÇª?
 OhΓÇª DonΓÇÖt move.
 Okay, finished!
 MotherΓÇª
 Hmm?
 NoΓÇª ItΓÇÖs nothing.
 OkayΓÇª
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it wonΓÇÖt go like it did with Itachi, huh?
 It mightΓÇÖve still been too soon for youΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm just, getting started. Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father!
 Hmm?
 One more timeΓÇª
 One more timeΓÇª Please join me.
 ItΓÇÖs still too soon for you.
 Even if I were to teach you for only after a weekΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve gottenΓÇªthe hang of the Jutsu.
 So I want you to see it.
 Failure is not an option!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 ThatΓÇÖs my boy.
 YouΓÇÖve done well.
 From now on, improve yourself and soar large
 so as not to bring shame to the crest on your back.
 Right!
 AndΓÇªlet me say one thing.
 DonΓÇÖt chase after your older brother anymore.
 MotherΓÇª?
 Hmm?
 What does Father really think of Big Brother and me?
 What is it all of a sudden?
 The other day, Father said to me, ΓÇ£ThatΓÇÖs my boy.ΓÇ¥
 HeΓÇÖd always said that only to Big Brother.
 So I was really happy.
 I seeΓÇªGood for you.
 But lately, Father and Brother havenΓÇÖt been getting along, soΓÇª
 I was thinkingΓÇª
 that I might just be a replacement for Big Brother.
 Your older brotherΓÇÖs your older brother. And you are you.
 Your father cares deeply about you both.
 Then why does he only think about Big Brother?!
 ThatΓÇÖs not itΓÇª
 Your father has to protect the Uchiha Clan
 as a representative of the clan.
 What about it?!
 Itachi is just bigger than you and is your elder.
 HeΓÇÖll naturally be entrusted
 with that much more work for the clan, right?
 Your father is the supervisor of the work, soΓÇª
 it might be that his eyes were likely to go towards your older brother.
 But, this is just between us.
 When heΓÇÖs with me,
 your father does nothing but talk about you.
 HeΓÇÖs just always sullen and awkward, soΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll catch up to Big Brother no matter what!
 Damn itΓÇª!
 Big BrotherΓÇÖs back is still far out of reach.
 Forgive me, SasukeΓÇª Maybe another time.
 ClanΓÇªClanΓÇª
 You measure incorrectly the size of your own ΓÇ£vesselsΓÇ¥
 and donΓÇÖt know the depth of mine, so you grovel there.
 My ΓÇ£vesselΓÇ¥ is dismayed at this foolish clan.
 I feel likeΓÇªever since that day,
 he hasnΓÇÖt been the same as he was before.
 Big BrotherΓÇª
 Today, when schoolΓÇÖs finished,
 will you join me for some Shuriken Jutsu training?
 IΓÇÖm busy. You should have Father teach you.
 But even I know that youΓÇÖre better at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.
 You always treat me like a nuisance like that.
 Forgive me, Sasuke. Maybe next timeΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt have the time to be dealing with you today.
 You always say, ΓÇ£Forgive me, Sasuke,ΓÇ¥ and poke me on the forehead.
 and you say ΓÇ£today,ΓÇ¥ but it never happens.
 Thank goodnessΓÇª heΓÇÖs the same as before.
 Big BrotherΓÇª
 His eyes looking back at Father that timeΓÇª
 It wasnΓÇÖt just an ordinary SharinganΓÇª
 AndΓÇª
 FatherΓÇª?
 Hmm?
 Are there several types of Sharingan?
 OhΓÇªYouΓÇÖre already interested in Sharingan?
 However, it's still too soon for you.
 ItΓÇÖs totally different from the Fire Style Jutsu.
 But someday, I tooΓÇª!
 After allΓÇª IΓÇÖm your kid, so.
 Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu above the Sharingan,
 the Mangekyo Sharingan.
 Mangekyo SharinganΓÇª
 In the long history of the Uchiha,
 itΓÇÖs a legendary Visual Jutsu that only a few develop.
 And itΓÇÖs said that it only opened under a particular condition.
 A particular conditionΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt chase after your older brother anymore.
 I wonder what he thinks of my relationship with Brother?
 FatherΓÇª
 Why doesnΓÇÖt Big Brother care about me?
 HeΓÇÖs a bit peculiarΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs a type of person who doesnΓÇÖt care for making friends with people.
 Why?
 Who knowsΓÇª?
 Even I, his father, canΓÇÖt read that boy.
 Here I spoke because I wanted more of Big BrotherΓÇÖs attention.
 Father isnΓÇÖt against it.
 Here, Sasuke! Your box lunch.
 IΓÇÖll watch your Shuriken practice after you come home.
 ItΓÇÖs not practice, itΓÇÖs training!
 IΓÇÖm off!
 ThatΓÇÖs goodΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not that Father dislikes Big Brother, after all.
 Big Brother graduated from the Academy at the top of his class at age seven.
 He learned to use the Sharingan at age eight.
 And he was promoted to Chunin at age ten.
 But, IΓÇÖve got the same Uchiha blood flowing inside me as he does.
 I wonΓÇÖt lose to him!
 YouΓÇÖre not gonna tell me this is the best you can do, are you?
 You boast about your Way of Ninja and this is all you've got?
 Are you still thinking that IΓÇÖm a member of your comrade game?
 If thatΓÇÖs the case, you'reΓÇª
 a hopeless fool!
 Stop wasting time!
 Give me all youΓÇÖve got,
 you number one hyperactive, knucklehead Ninja!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 Just as Neji said,
 it seems SasukeΓÇÖs in the darkness right now.
 Damn it.
 He really did hit me with all his might.
 Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade or anything anymore?!
 DonΓÇÖt all those things we did together in Squad Seven
 mean anything to you?!

191,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 I wonΓÇÖt count on you.
 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I 'll go too.
 I promised Hinata that I would definitely protect you, Princess!
 With HinataΓÇª?
 She fought with the second Janin and got hurt badlyΓÇª
 Hinata didΓÇª?
 You guys said that you didnΓÇÖt accept the mission of protecting me.
 Then why do you concern yourselves with meΓÇª?
 IΓÇª
 Not only me, but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before us is hurt or sadΓÇª That's all.
 Well, letΓÇÖs go!
 If we pass through the valley ahead of us,
 weΓÇÖll get to the town.
 If we do that,
 they probably wonΓÇÖt chase us all the way there!
 Forecast: Death! Cloudy with Chance of Sun!
 Too bad, but you guys wonΓÇÖt be able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are going to die here!
 Wh-Why is he floating in the air?
 Hey kid, I bet a low-class Ninja like you canΓÇÖt even imagine my Jutsu.
 Take this!
 Naruto!
 IΓÇÖm okay.
 But what just flew at me?
 DonΓÇÖt waste your time fighting me.
 I have already captured all three of your friends.
 What?
 Just hand over the girl.
 If you do that IΓÇÖll spare your friends.
 Choji and HinataΓÇª
 So, what are you going to do kid?
 NarutoΓÇª Are you going to abandon me too?
 Oh no, this princess is telling you to save her,
 and let your friends die.
 Well, I donΓÇÖt mind that kind of thinking since itΓÇÖs the same as mine.
 Same as yours?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 If someone is useful,
 then you should make use of them
 even though they may be your siblings.
 There is one thing I need to thank you guys for.
 Thank us? 					For what?!
 For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.
 I was going to put an end to them myself sooner or later anyways.
 WhatΓÇª?!
 It was clear that they would soon tell me,
 ΓÇ£Big Brother, give us the property and the money too.ΓÇ¥
 Three feudal lords are not necessary in one country.
 And you still call yourselves brothers?!
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter.
 Even though itΓÇÖs my parents or my brothers.
 I'll make use of anything I can.
 Now, give her to me.
 I refuse.
 I see.
 NarutoΓÇª
 A person who would abandon his siblings
 would never keep his promise with me.
 Well, thatΓÇÖs true.
 ItΓÇÖs impossible, Naruto!
 You donΓÇÖt even know what kind of Jutsu it is!
 That doesnΓÇÖt matter!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Take this!
 What is this guy?
 ThereΓÇÖs something hard around his body that I canΓÇÖt seeΓÇª
 Naruto!
 I'm sorry, but none of your Ninjutsu work on me.
 Not even one.
 Damn it!
 What?!
 What is that?
 Crystallized iceΓÇª?
 I can gather water vapor in the air
 and instantly turn it into crystallized ice.
 So the things that just attacked me were ice Shuriken.
 Man! ItΓÇÖs hard to see if itΓÇÖs transparent ice.
 Just that is not too interesting.
 What is this great sense of danger?
 IΓÇÖm sure his Jutsu has already started!
 Where is it, where is it coming from?!
 Kid, do you know today's weather forecast?
 Weather forecast?
 Cloudy and partly sunny.
 ItΓÇÖs a good weather for you to die.
 What is this?
 What?!
 Look out!
 Damn it!
 Naruto!
 ThatΓÇÖs a lens!
 Lens?!
 Yup, I turned the crystallized ice into lens
 to gather the sunlight and shoot it.
 So, I canΓÇÖt really control it, but itΓÇÖll be an instant when you die.
 As soon as the battle condition at the Land of Green is prepared,
 IΓÇÖll burn up the surrounding countries with this Jutsu.
 This way!
 ItΓÇÖs no use.
 I could even see things that are a thousand miles away.
 I found you.
 NarutoΓÇª Why do you protect me?
 I wonder whyΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know either.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Haruna!
 While I distract him, run!
 DonΓÇÖt even think you guys could get away from my Jutsu
 by doing that!
 You decided to hand me over the princess?
 Who would hand over Haruna to the likes of you!
 What a fool.
 IΓÇÖm telling you that if you hand me the selfish princess
 and just go back to the village, IΓÇÖll let your friends go.
 I promised with Hinata that I will save Haruna!
 Just to keep a promise with your friend,
 youΓÇÖre gonna risk your life to fight in a hopeless battle, huhΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖre just like the feudal lord in Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my fatherΓÇª?!
 YouΓÇÖre just like the feudal lord in Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my fatherΓÇª?!
 This is what the feudal lord foolishly said
 to us who were trying to take over the Land of Green:
 ΓÇ£Please do not torment the people in this country.ΓÇ¥
 I beg you!
 I donΓÇÖt care what happens to me,
 but please promise me one thing!
 This is a small weak country surrounded by big countries.
 Without the powers of the people, the country cannot prosper!
 In order for the country to prosper,
 we must take care of each individual people
 and not sacrifice a single life!
 I want you to consider the people as a family
 and not torment them.
 I am the feudal lord!
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter what I do to the people, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs whyΓÇª
 That's why this country has been at peace until now!
 Peace doesnΓÇÖt matter to me.
 All I need to do is use the people as the stepping stones
 and feather my nest!
 And because of that kind of good nature,
 his daughter was taken as a hostage!
 What do you mean?!
 It seems like it was ten years ago.
 A lot of the people were sacrificed by the pressure of the big countryΓÇª
 Riots occurred in the country and the country came close to corruption.
 It was a bitter decisionΓÇª
 I had no choice but to let my daughter,
 who is more important than my life, taken as a hostage.
 I know that Haruna will not forgive meΓÇª
 A cold-hearted father who sacrificed his own daughter
 just for the peace of the country.
 Why donΓÇÖt you ask your daughter directly?!
 In the after life!
 My father wasΓÇªkilled!
 What an outrageously good-natured person, huh?
 YouΓÇÖre wrong, he was a great feudal lord!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Listen!
 There are two kinds of human beings in this world.
 Those who use others, and those who get used!
 In my case, I will get to the top using anyone,
 whether itΓÇÖs my parents or my friends.
 You! IΓÇÖll never forgive you!
 Shut up!
 D-DamnΓÇª!
 Die!
 NarutoΓÇª
 You canΓÇÖt move anymore?!
 YouΓÇÖre not the oneΓÇª
 It was because of HarunaΓÇÖs father that this country was peacefulΓÇª
 The person who is going to succeed this country isΓÇª
 The person isΓÇª
 Haruna!
 Stop!
 Stupid!
 Why arenΓÇÖt you running away?!
 Kill me! If you kill me, your goal will be fulfilled, right?!
 Naruto, Naruto has nothing to do with this!
 So both the parent and daughter are na├»ve, after all.
 Why not complain to your father in the afterlife
 for making you sacrifice your life for the country?
 How scaryΓÇª
 Y-You!
 ItΓÇÖs time for you to die, kid.
 IΓÇÖm not a kid!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 IΓÇÖm not going to hand over the Land of Green
 to a person like you!
 Naruto!
 Die!
 What?!
 NoΓÇªwayΓÇª
 But kid, itΓÇÖs too late even though you took me downΓÇª
 The Land of Green without a feudal lord will collapse
 due to the war between the large countries over its territory.
 ItΓÇÖs too bad, but thatΓÇÖs not gonna happen!
 Shizune!
 ItΓÇÖs a pain, but we came to get you guys!
 Shikamaru!
 ButΓÇªI didnΓÇÖt ask you guys to come get us!
 But you look pretty beaten up.
 No no, this isΓÇª
 Naruto!
 Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!
 Everyone was safe!
 Yeah.
 We were rescued by the people of Leaf Village.
 Huh? Oh yeah, why are you guys here?
 We received notice of a coup in the Land of Green
 and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me to comeΓÇª
 Princess HarunaΓÇÖs father was very kind to Lady Tsunade and me.
 My fatherΓÇª?
 Please forgive us, when we arrived, your father was alreadyΓÇª
 I seeΓÇªIΓÇÖve caused so much trouble for you.
 Damn!
 The position of the feudal lord that I finally got a hold ofΓÇª
 But, then the surrounding countries are not going to stay quiet.
 ItΓÇÖs okay.
 An announcement has been sent out to the neighboring countries
 in the name of the next feudal lord.
 Under your name, Princess Haruna.
 Then we donΓÇÖt need to worry about the country getting attacked anymore!
 Haruna!
 HarunaΓÇª
 Do it.
 You want to take revenge with your own hands, right?
 IΓÇÖll do the same if I were you.
 I amΓÇªnot like you!
 HarunaΓÇª
 Kikunojou, please forgive me.
 Princess Haruna.
 Here, Kikunojou could look over the Land of Green.
 I'm sure that Kikunojou will watch over everyone forever.
 Well, Lady Haruna, we are leaving now.
 Thank you, Naruto, Choji, and Hinata.
 Shizune, IΓÇÖd like to ask a special favor.
 What is it, Princess Haruna?
 My role is to take over my fatherΓÇÖs will to protect the peace of Land of Green.
 In order to do that,
 I want to borrow some help from the Leaf Village.
 Our help?
 Yes.
 I want you to lend me Naruto.
 Huh?!
 Please, Naruto.
 Princess Haruna.
 I want you to help me with the revival of the Land of Green.
 IΓÇªIΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry, but I canΓÇÖt really do that.
 I need to go back to my friends.
 And I need to do more training and become much stronger.
 There are things that I must do.
 ItΓÇÖs all for my precious friends!
 Then I canΓÇÖt take you away from themΓÇª
 Naruto, IΓÇÖll promise that I will do my best to keep my fatherΓÇÖs wishes
 and strive for a peaceful country where no one will be sacrificed.
 Yeah!
 ItΓÇÖs a promise!
 Thank you! Naruto!
 Good-bye! Everybody!
 WeΓÇÖll come back someday!
 Bye!
 See ya!

 Please take this medicine quickly.
 Oh, myΓÇª
 Just as I get back, I have to clean the room.
 Please make sure you to take your medicine.
 I don't need that kind of lip service.
 It's medicine that I prescribed.
 The pain should subside at least slightly.
 The pain on this arm that seems to burnΓÇª
 I never thought that it cause this much suffering.
 SarutobiΓÇªknown as Third Hokage. lt's his last curse, after all.
 Enough of the talkingΓÇª
 More importantly, has that individual been found?
 YesΓÇª She seems to be at a place called Tanzaku Town.
 Tanzaku TownΓÇª
 Is that soΓÇª?
 But the opponent is one of the Sannin, the Legendary Three Ninjas.
 It wonΓÇÖt be that simple.
 Good medicine tends to taste bitter.
 Here.
 ItΓÇÖs the same oneΓÇª But this is the trick?
 YouΓÇÖre the type who was yelled at at the academy
 for not having concentration, right?
 That doesnΓÇÖt have anything to do with me now.
 Look at this paper.
 Uh?
 IΓÇÖve seen it.
 Fine, then.
 Look at it again.
 Hmm?
 So what is this?
 ItΓÇÖs not something that I need to explain in length,
 but when you first looked at this blank piece of paper,
 you just glanced at the whole thing, correct?
 Probably.
 Then where do you look on this one?
 Most likely the point in the middle?
 When a human being looks at just a blank piece of paper,
 he doesnΓÇÖt know where to look, so the eyes wander.
 But if you put even a single point on it,
 the mind focuses thereΓÇª
 This is concentrating at a single point and as you focus your mind,
 you become spiritually stable and you are able to extract unexpected power.
 Huh?
 When you opened a hole on the rubber ball,
 you must have been concentrating desperately
 to fill up the Chakra in the palm of your hand.
 Yeah, yeah.
 When you concentrate, power emerges.
 But without a target, it is difficult to concentrate.
 ThatΓÇÖs why we have thisΓÇª
 Listen Naruto, from now on,
 when you store up the Chakra you build in your right hand,
 try to store it up by concentrating on that mark.
 ConcentrateΓÇª
 All right, IΓÇÖll try it!
 Focal Point: The Mark of the Leaf
 Concentrate!
 Darn it. ItΓÇÖs not supposed to be like this.
 It has to break like ΓÇ£pang.ΓÇ¥
 Concentrate!
 HelloΓÇª IΓÇÖd like to make a little inquiry.
 Dang it.
 Concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 No good.
 Dang it. What does it mean to concentrate?!
 Damn you, Sarutobi!
 All right thenΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm going again to gather some information.
 WhatΓÇª? But you just came.
 I donΓÇÖt have any time to waste.
 Hey, heyΓÇª!
 IsnΓÇÖt there going to be even a little soulful game of catch
 between the master and pupil?
 You scoundrel.
 Strike!
 Here,  the game of catch is over.
 See you later.
 HumphΓÇª IΓÇÖll forget about that Pervy Sage and work hard by myself.
 ThatΓÇÖs the only way, NarutoΓÇª
 You have to do this training alone.
 You have the ability to approach the Fourth HokageΓÇÖs levelΓÇª
 Grasp it by yourself!
 HmmΓÇª Never seen her.
 If thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇª
 Sorry to bother you.

 As well as where she is right now.

 Her losses started to pile upΓÇª
 So she was talking about changing her location.
 Where to?
 One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade, is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.

 Here it comes!
 Congratulations to the customer!
 Fever has started on machine number 44.
 Now, please keep on getting it out like a flood.
 Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happen once in while.
 A 3-7 for me?
 Oh wow, lady.
 Yeah, what a great work.
 Wish I could be favored by good fortune too.
 ΓÇô Oh, here it comes again! ΓÇô Here it comes again!
 YayΓÇªitΓÇÖs ΓÇ£feverΓÇ¥ again!
 A person like me pulls a big hit like thisΓÇª
 I have a bad premonition.
 I also have some knowledge regarding Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 I did use to be part of the Medical Corps, after all.
 She was the first person to propose what is now an accepted practice
 of assigning one medical specialist to a small squad of four.
 This was a very revolutionary- ideaΓÇª
 A small combat unit that doesnΓÇÖt even have emergency medical skills,
 what would happen to them in a battlefield is clearer than seeing fire.
 Countless experiences in war
 simply became knowledge to equip themselves with.
 Many who were sacrificed led to the creation of that style.
 A person understands the nature of things for the first time
 after losing them.
 And the thing created by one of the legendary Sannin,
 who is known as the medical specialist
 is that sacrifice.
 Not workingΓÇª
 I got to concentrate even more.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 ConcentrateΓÇª
 Concentrate on one point.
 Strike!
 Strike!
 That stupid perveΓÇÖs face floats up in my head
 and I canΓÇÖt even concentrate.
 Oh boyΓÇª
 Some gal somewhere is talking about me again.
 Pinball Games
 Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 Your winning this much is like a miracleΓÇª
 But you donΓÇÖt look pleased at all.
 This town.
 Huh?
 I get a bad premonition.
 WeΓÇÖre going to hurry up and leave.
 But this is a tourist resortΓÇª
 We should take our time and go see the famous castle and all.
 Then weΓÇÖre going to hurry up and see it so we can leave.
 ButΓÇªLady Tsunade!
 Lord Orochimaru!
 LetΓÇÖs get this business over with.
 Even if we have to use a slightly rough method.
 I got to do it.
 Ouch!
 OuchΓÇª It hurts so much, I canΓÇÖt even build up my ChakraΓÇª
 He might be reaching his limit soon.
 Just a bitΓÇªjust a bit more rest.
 Hey!
 You guys, weΓÇÖre in class right now.
 YouΓÇªfools!
 You guys have no concentration at allΓÇª!
 This is not the way to become fine Ninja.
 How can we stay still at a table, right, Akamaru?
 IΓÇÖm hungry.
 Sensei, if itΓÇÖs a scolding, do it quickly.
 What the--?! You, you guysΓÇª
 From now, we will have an after-school lesson
 to teach you guys more concentration!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 You guys are going to do from now
 what the predecessors of the Leaf Village
 used to perform every day as a concentration method!
 It is training to build up Chakra
 by concentrating your entire energy on the leaf on your forehead.
 ItΓÇÖs an ancient way of learning
 how not to become distracted from anything else
 by concentrating on a single point, the leaf.
 The one who hones his concentration  is truly a great NinjaΓÇª
 This is the origin of the Leaf Symbol on the headband.
 That sounds like a lie.
 ArenΓÇÖt you making that story up to force us to try harder?
 IΓÇÖm not making this up! ltΓÇÖs a true story.
 Anyhow, can you really become a great Ninja
 by just polishing your concentration?
 At any rate, a great Ninja is a guy whoΓÇÖs strong.
 Hey, you have a point.
 This stuffΓÇª
 Bye, bye Sensei!
 Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.
 ΓÇô We wonΓÇÖt wait! ΓÇô We don't have time for that!
 Hey! You misfits!
 This is the same thing.
 I should have paid more attention to what Iruka Sensei was sayingΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm so stupid.
 But nothing will start if I just keep on regretting.
 All right, IΓÇÖm going to master this!
 Concentrate, concentrateΓÇª
 Concentrate!
 Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does have a commanding presence!
 ItΓÇÖs worth being designated as the cultural heritage.
 DonΓÇÖt dallyΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre going to hurry up and leave this town.
 Lady Tsunade, please look more carefullyΓÇª
 It costs nothing to view.
 Lady Tsunade?
 What is this chill?
 Now!
 What a kidΓÇª
 Raising the density in Chakra to the point that it burns the palm.
 He never ceases to amaze me.
 It broke.
 Good! The second step seems  to be complete.
 HurryΓÇª The third step.
 That will come later.
 WeΓÇÖll now go meet Tsunade.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Orochimaru.
 I found you.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 I can master the third step while walking? Give me a break!
 Fool! If we don't hurry it up, we'll lose Tsunade!
 Besides, she's short-tempered and impatient!
 Where are we heading?
 If she's here in this town, we'll just look for her from somewhere high up.
 ΓÇô So we'll climb up a castle. ΓÇô Castle?!
 ΓÇô Can't you see over there?! ΓÇô Which way is ""over there""?
 I'm sayingΓÇª
 Oh! What the--?!

 Light vs. Dark: The Two Faces of Gaara!
 So youΓÇÖll fight for the sake of others?!
 ThatΓÇÖs why you guys are only at that level!
 You donΓÇÖt need a reason to fight!
 Only the one who remains undefeated can actually feel his own existence!
 Come on, forget about your insignificant friends
 and fight only for the sake of your own existence!
 InsignificantΓÇª
 friends?
 Those who hold silly sentiments about fighting
 should just die!
 I'm sick of listening to you talk!
 I'll clobber you for sure!
 You guys misunderstand real strength!
 Shut up!
 W-WhyΓÇª? Why is it?!
 Why YashamaruΓÇª?
 Why did you, whyΓÇª?
 WhyΓÇª?
 Love isΓÇª
 a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person.
 Just like my older sister did.
 You are a precious person who is close to me, Gaara!
 AlwaysΓÇª only Yashamaru would alwaysΓÇª
 MeΓÇªalways meΓÇª
 It was an order.
 I was commissioned to kill youΓÇª
 By your fatherΓÇª
 Lord Kazekage.
 My fatherΓÇª?
 Why did my fatherΓÇª?
 WhyΓÇª? Why me?
 Gaara, you who were born and possessed by the Sand Spirit ShukakuΓÇª
 have been watched over as an experiment.
 However, Gaara, you couldnΓÇÖt control the living spirit Shukaku,
 the Sand Spirit which possesses the power of the sand.
 Eventually your existence would become too dangerous for the village.
 Before that occurredΓÇª
 So Yashamaru, you had not choiceΓÇª
 but to comply with my fatherΓÇÖs orderΓÇª?
 NoΓÇª That is not correct.
 It is true I accepted Lord KazekageΓÇÖs order.
 But if I had wanted to turn it down, I could have turned it down.
 GaaraΓÇª
 Deep down in my heart, I probablyΓÇª
 hated you.
 You, whose birth took the life of my beloved older sister.
 The child she left behind in deathΓÇª
 Thinking that you were her remembrance, I tried desperately to love you.
 HoweverΓÇª I was not able to.
 My sister didnΓÇÖt choose to have you.
 My sister became a sacrifice for the village,
 and she died while cursing this village!
 From that time, I probablyΓÇª
 have been burdened with a wound of the heart that could never heal.
 Unlike a wound on the body, there is no ointment and sometimes,
 it doesnΓÇÖt heal for oneΓÇÖs entire life.
 A wound of the heart?
 Your nameΓÇª is the name my sister gave you.
 ""This childΓÇÖs name is GaaraΓÇª
 ""A devil that loves only itselfΓÇª
 ""Love only yourselfΓÇª
 ""And fight only for your own sake.
 ""If you do that, you will continue to exist.""
 Such was the hope it contained.
 HoweverΓÇª
 my sister did not give you this name
 because she was concerned about you or loved you.
 The reason she gave you this name, a name so you would continue to existΓÇª
 ΓÇªwas so that the deep-seated hatred of my sister
 who died hating and cursing this villageΓÇª
 would remainΓÇª
 and be known to all!
 You were neverΓÇªloved!
 This is the lastΓÇª
 Please dieΓÇª
 I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.
 Love?
 The sand automatically trying to protect you is like the love of a mother.
 I believe that sand is filled with your motherΓÇÖs will.
 Love.
 Love only yourself.
 And fight only for your own sake.
 So that is GaaraΓÇª That is me.
 I finally understand.
 I am alone.
 I will no longer believe in anyoneΓÇª or love anyone.
 I am alone!
 Yes, I am all by myself.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter? Hurry up and come at me!
 Don't you care what happens to your so-called precious friends?!
 Sakura!
 Dang it!
 NarutoΓÇÖs not his usual selfΓÇª
 Did something happen between them?
 In any caseΓÇª
 In any case, I need to save Sakura!
 ButΓÇª what to do?!
 ThatΓÇÖs it!
 Since it's come to thisΓÇª Though it's gonna use up a lot of ChakraΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no choice but to summon the Chief Gamabunta!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 WhatΓÇÖs this?! YouΓÇÖre a little kid!
 If you want something from me, give me some snack!
 If you donΓÇÖt, I wonΓÇÖt play with you!
 You know something? I hate you frogs!
 What did you say?! DonΓÇÖt make fun of amphibians! Really!
 Jeez, I donΓÇÖt have time to play with you, little squirt!
 Darn! Why is itΓÇª?
 I practiced for so long, but with this, thereΓÇÖs no other wayΓÇª
 I need to save everyone!
 EveryoneΓÇªyou say?
 DonΓÇÖt make me laugh.
 I fightΓÇªonly for myself!
 HeΓÇªheΓÇÖs transforming again!
 If you donΓÇÖt take me down, the sand over this girl wonΓÇÖt fall away!
 Not only that, as time passesΓÇª
 this sand will slowly squeeze tighter and eventually suffocate this girl!
 Sakura!
 HeΓÇÖs getting closer and closer to being a Perfect Possession.
 That Jutsu hasnΓÇÖt been activated yet,
 but at this rate, IΓÇÖll also beΓÇª!
 Those eyesΓÇª
 Sand Shuriken!
 YouΓÇÖreΓÇªreally weak!
 Shut up!
 But what is that guy?
 YouΓÇÖre persistentΓÇª Sarutobi Sensei!
 I-It doesnΓÇÖt move?!
 Y-You hard-to-kill fools!
 Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?
 The Leaf Village is my home!
 I told you I am the pillar of that house!
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖm saying I will break that pillar!
 As long as the people of the village
 fiercely fight to protect their dear comrades,
 the pillar of the Leaf Village will not be broken by the likes of you!
 I wonder about that.
 Do not underestimate the Hokage!
 I-ImpossibleΓÇª!
 Where isΓÇª? Most of your Chakra should be gone!
 Chakra and Ninjutsu are not all there is to strength!
 W-What lonely eyesΓÇª
 Such lonely eyesΓÇª
 This guy is also turning into a monsterΓÇª the same as me.
 I hated every last one of them.
 I didnΓÇÖt understand who I was,
 why I was so hated, why I even existed.
 In other words,
 youΓÇÖre the Nine-Tailed Fox who killed lrukaΓÇÖs parents and ruined the village!
 YouΓÇÖve been deceived by everyone in the village all along!
 IΓÇª
 When I learned that the Nine-Tailed Fox was inside me,
 everyone in the village seemed even more cold-heartedΓÇª
 I was so deeply troubledΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 Naruto! LetΓÇÖs go have ramen for a change!
 Yay! I will, I will!
 IΓÇÖll have the one with extra BBQ pork slices!
 Huh! You loserΓÇª lf you want to beat me train harder!
 Shut up! I wonΓÇÖt lose to you!
 Hey Naruto! What did Sasuke say about me?
 He didnΓÇÖt say anythingΓÇª
 By the way! By the way! Wouldn't you rather know how I feelΓÇª?
 Oh! Really, Sakura!
 IΓÇÖm gonna eat now!
 UmΓÇª Naruto, youΓÇÖll really die if you eat only noodles and sweet red bean porridge.
 YouΓÇÖre a Ninja, so eat more vegetables!
 Here, have some!
 What?! I donΓÇÖt like vegetables!
 People appeared  who acknowledged meΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why I became all right,
 even though there was the demon fox inside my body,
 or even if the people of the village looked at me with cold eyes.
 BecauseΓÇª I wasnΓÇÖt alone anymore!
 I never imagined how happy and fortunate I could feel.
 How reallyΓÇªreallyΓÇª
 great it was.
 How truly great it was to be here.
 I was relieved to know I am allowed to be here, to exist!
 ThatΓÇÖs why it scares me to think about the pastΓÇª
 That suffering is agonizingΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a pitch-black hell!
 IfΓÇªI had remained that way, all aloneΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs precisely why I understand!
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 This is the answer I came toΓÇª
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 I donΓÇÖt know what happened, butΓÇª
 This guyΓÇÖs always been suffering all aloneΓÇª
 Even now, without ever feeling reliefΓÇª
 Only able to believe in himselfΓÇª
 Even now, heΓÇÖs battling in hellΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs how it isΓÇª
 To him, someone like me who's acknowledged by othersΓÇª
 might seem like a weakling in a world of happiness without tensionΓÇª
 Can I really win against a guy like this?
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?! Are you afraid of me?
 To fight for the sake of oneself? To fight for the sake of others?
 You should just love yourself, and fight for yourself!
 That is the definition of the strongest one!
 Now fight me!
 What happened to the boldness you had earlier?!
 Show me your strength! IΓÇÖll throw that strength to the ground!
 Now whatΓÇÖs the matter?! lf you donΓÇÖt fight me, IΓÇÖll kill that girl!
 Darn it!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Wind Style!
 Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!
 This isnΓÇÖt goodΓÇª He really got me.
 First, IΓÇÖll toy with you without killing you!
 I look forward to seeing when and how you give up
 and abandon your friends!

 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan
 No matter what darkness might lie ahead,
 I will rush into it headfirst!
 No matter what happens,
 I will get my hands on that power!
 ItΓÇÖs getting lateΓÇª
 What was that?
 I thought I sensed someone there just nowΓÇª
 The lightsΓÇª
 It isnΓÇÖt even close to bedtime yetΓÇª
 This isΓÇª!
 Wh-What is thisΓÇª?!
 What the hell is this?!
 UncleΓÇª AuntΓÇª
 FatherΓÇª MotherΓÇª
 Father? Mother?
 ThereΓÇÖs somebody in there!
 Move!
 Move!
 Move!
 Father! Mother!
 Big Brother!
 Big Brother! Father and Mother areΓÇª!
 Why? For what reason?!
 Who the hell would do something like thisΓÇª?!
 Big BrotherΓÇªwhat areΓÇª?
 What are you doing, Big Brother?!
 You pathetic younger brotherΓÇª
 Mangekyo Sharingan!
 Stop! Big Brother!
 DonΓÇÖt make me see this kind of thing!
 WhyΓÇª?!
 Big Brother, why did youΓÇª?!
 WhyΓÇª
 Big BrotherΓÇª Why did youΓÇª?
 In order to measure my vesselΓÇª
 To measure your vessel?
 Is that all?
 Only for that reasonΓÇª you killed everybodyΓÇª?
 That is what is important.
 What the hell is that?
 You gotta be kidding!
 IΓÇÖm scaredΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm scared!
 DonΓÇÖt kill meΓÇª!
 I donΓÇÖt believe it!
 This is too unlike you, Big Brother. I meanΓÇª
 The reason I acted as the big brother you desired wasΓÇª
 because I wanted to measure your vessel.
 You have the potential to become my opponent
 in order for me to measure my vessel.
 You hated meΓÇª
 and you continued to have the desire to surpass me.
 ThatΓÇÖs exactly why I will allow you to liveΓÇª
 for my own benefit.
 You are someone who could be able to use Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.
 However, on one conditionΓÇª
 That you must kill your closest friendΓÇª
 Y-YouΓÇÖve gotta be kiddingΓÇª
 Just like I didΓÇª
 Regarding Shisui Uchiha who committed suicide last night
 by throwing himself into the Nakano RiverΓÇª
 The other one that did not show up to the meeting is ShisuiΓÇª
 If I remember correctlyΓÇª
 you adored him like he was your real older brotherΓÇª
 That wasΓÇªyour doingΓÇª?
 Big Brother, youΓÇªkilled Shisui?!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇªand because of that I obtained these eyes.
 The main hall of Nakano ShrineΓÇª
 Underneath the seventh tatami mat on the far right
 is the secret gathering place of the Clan.
 There you will find recorded the secret ofΓÇª
 the raison d'├¬tre of the Uchiha ClanΓÇÖs Visual Jutsu.
 The secret of the raison d'├¬treΓÇª?
 If you attain these eyes,
 you will become the third person including myself
 to utilize the Mangekyo Sharingan.
 If that happensΓÇª
 then there will have been meaning in my allowing you to live.
 HoweverΓÇªat presentΓÇª
 You are not worth killing.
 My pathetic younger brotherΓÇª
 If you want to kill me, then begrudge me!
 Hate me!
 And live in an ugly mannerΓÇª
 Run awayΓÇªrun awayΓÇª and cling to lifeΓÇª
 And one day, when you have the same eyes as I doΓÇª
 come and stand before me!
 A dreamΓÇª?
 YesΓÇªthatΓÇÖs right.
 The only one who survivedΓÇª is that boy.
 Didn't he have an older brother?
 Yes, but heΓÇÖs gone missingΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be trueΓÇª That elite Uchiha ClanΓÇª
 Hi, Sasuke! What did you come to buy today?
 Sasuke, are you on your way to school?
 Yeah.
 I saw Itachi earlier, but heΓÇÖs very admirable, isnΓÇÖt he?
 HeΓÇÖs already become a top-class Shinobi.
 He graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class at age seven
 and attained the rank of Chunin at age ten, didnΓÇÖt he?
 He was able to use Sharingan when he was eight!
 ThatΓÇÖs true, isnΓÇÖt it?
 That boy is truly the pride of the Uchiha Clan.
 Welcome homeΓÇªSasuke!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 Wait a secondΓÇª
 What is it?
 Mother?!
 Then why only Big Brother!
 Your brother's your brother. And you are you.
 Father cares deeply about both of you.
 The main hall of Nakano ShrineΓÇª
 Located underneath the seventh tatami mat on the far right
 is our clanΓÇÖs secret gathering placeΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª So thatΓÇÖs what it isΓÇª
 Ninja Academy
 Hey, ShikamaruΓÇª
 Wanna go to the candy shop after school?
 HuhΓÇª No way.
 You can do that ΓÇÿcuz your motherΓÇÖs nice,
 but if my mother found out that I bought myself a snack before going home,
 IΓÇÖd be in big trouble.
 Did you hear the newsΓÇª
 that entire Uchiha Clan was apparently murdered?
 Yeah, my dad told me.
 Apparently heΓÇÖs the only one who survivedΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs my boy.
 With me, youΓÇÖre all your father talks aboutΓÇª
 I wonderΓÇªwhat kind of things Father was saying to MotherΓÇª
 If you want to kill meΓÇª
 Begrudge me! Hate me!
 If itΓÇÖs for the purpose of killing you,
 I will rush headfirst into whatever darkness which may lie ahead!
 I will obtain that power no matter what!
 From this point onwards, I am an avenger!
 Sasuke is now in depths of darknessΓÇª
 If you stop in a place like thisΓÇª
 you wonΓÇÖt be able to catch up with Sasuke.
 Neji, itΓÇÖs just like you said.
 That guy looks like heΓÇÖs in the depths of darkness right nowΓÇª
 He really hit me with his full strength! Damn it!
 DonΓÇÖt you consider meΓÇª your comrade any longer?!
 DonΓÇÖt all those things we did together in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!
 No.
 I will get my hands on that power no matter what.
 It wasnΓÇÖt meaninglessΓÇª
 To me, you became myΓÇª closest friend.
 We've becomeΓÇªfriends?
 ThenΓÇªwhy?!
 All the more reason whyΓÇª
 All the more reason whyΓÇª
 thereΓÇÖs meaning in taking you down.
 I donΓÇÖt fully understand butΓÇª
 I understood that you want to fight me with your everything!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 Are you trying to take me down for real?
 I donΓÇÖt know any longer
 whether you really meant what you said earlier or not!
 Could it be that it was only I who thought we were friends?
 If thatΓÇÖs the case, IΓÇÖm just a really lame guyΓÇª
 ArenΓÇÖt I? Sasuke?

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 I see. Sakura, you've come, too.
 Now you can formally register  for the Chunin Exam.
 What do you mean?
 Actually, from the start,
 only three-man squads could apply and take the exams.
 But Sensei, you said that the decision to take the exams
 was up to the individual.
 YesΓÇª I said that.
 Were you lying?
 Yes, I wasΓÇª
 If I said that,
 Sasuke and Naruto would probably forcefully convince you to take it.
 Even if you didn't have the will to apply,
 if Sasuke asks you
 you would attempt to take the exams half-heartedly.
 For Sasuke's sake and, well, Naruto's.
 Then, ifΓÇª
 it had only been Sasuke and Naruto who had come here?
 I would've stopped the Exam here.
 I wouldn't have felt like letting them go beyond this point.
 ButΓÇªyou guys came here on your own will.
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 And, Sasuke!
 I'm glad you came.
 You're a team I'm proud of.
 Now then, go on!
 Okay! Let's go!
 Genin Takedown! All Nine Rookies Face Off!
 W-Wow!
 W-What's withΓÇªthis?
 There are so many of themΓÇª
 Could it be that they're all applicants?
 TheyΓÇªall lookΓÇªimmensely strongΓÇª
 Sasuke, you're late!
 I thought I'd be able to see you for the first time in awhile,
 so I was waiting in excitement.
 Get away from Sasuke! lno-Pig!
 Oh, my. It's Sakura.
 Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, ehΓÇª Ugly!
 What did you say?!
 What's up with this?
 Huh?
 Are you guys going to take this bothersome Exam, too?
 Oh, it's the idiot trio.
 Quit calling us that!
 Man, this is a freaking botherΓÇª
 Shikamaru Nara.
 Always complaining, has no motivation.
 He's a bellyaching idiot.
 Choji Akimichi.
 He's always eating something.
 That's all he is, a fat idiot.
 SasukeΓÇªis mine. Bleah!
 Ino Yamanaka.
 She's always fighting with Sakura. She's her rival.
 A Sasuke-crazy idiot.
 Yahoo, I found you!
 My my, everybody's here.
 H-HelloΓÇª
 OhΓÇª
 Hinata Hyuga.
 She's a weird person who turns her eyes away whenever I look at her!
 She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.
 Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.
 They're louder than I am!
 He always brings his dog and always has a bossy look.
 He really annoys me!
 Shino Aburame.
 As for this guy, I really don't get him!
 He's a type I'm not good with.
 What did you say?
 You guys, too?! 					 Man.
 Ha! I see.
 This means all nine Genin rookies are taking the Exam, ehΓÇª!
 Now thenΓÇª
 How far can we go?
 EhΓÇªSasuke?
 Hmph!ΓÇª
 You're mighty confident. Kiba.
 We've trained a great deal, so...
 We won't lose to you guys!
 Shut up!
 I don't know about Sasuke, but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!
 I'm sorry. NarutoΓÇª
 Kiba didn't mean it like thatΓÇª
 Huh?
 Akamaru, you've become tasty-lookingΓÇª
 What?
 Don't step on it.
 Huh?
 I said, don't step on it.
 You'reΓÇªgonna eat that?
 Hey, you guys!
 You should be a little quieter.
 You guys are the ""rookie nine"" ΓÇª fresh out of the academy, right?
 Carrying on like that with cute facesΓÇªMan.
 This isn't a field trip.
 Who're you? Acting all haughty!
 I'm Kabuto Yakushi. Anyway, take a good look around you.
 Behind youΓÇª They're from the Rain Village.
 They're hot-tempered.
 Everyone's tense before the Exam.
 I thought I'd warn you guys before you get your butts whippedΓÇª
 I guess it can't be helped.
 You're rookies who don't know left from rightΓÇª
 You remind me of my old self.
 You're KabutoΓÇªright?
 YesΓÇª
 Then, is this your second time?
 NoΓÇª
 It's my seventh time.
 Huh?!
 This Exam is only held twice a year, so it's now my fourth year.
 Then that means you know a lot about these exams?!
 Kind ofΓÇª
 No kidding. Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?
 But you haven't passed.
 Yeah, well, that is the case, yesΓÇª
 Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?
 Man, this is utterly bothersomeΓÇª
 Then, maybe I'll give a bit of information to my cute juniors.
 With these Ninja Info Cards.
 Ninja Info CardsΓÇª?
 To put it simply,
 they're cards that have information burned into them and coded with Chakra.
 I spent four whole years gathering information for this Exam.
 There are close to two hundred of these cards.
 They are pure white to the eyeΓÇª
 To open the data on these cards...
 What're you doing?
 The way it works is that no one can see the info
 without using my ChakraΓÇª
 For exampleΓÇªLike thisΓÇª
 \Whoa, awesome! What information is this?
 The number of test-takers and participating nations,
 and the number of applicants from each respective village
 is individually displayed.
 Why do you think that
 the Chunin Exam is jointly conducted in the first place?
 It's said it's done to deepen friendship among nations first
 and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.
 ""It's said""?
 That's right.
 The real aim is in the checking of Shinobi levels of neighboring nations
 and keeping power balance equal.
 PowerΓÇªEqual?
 Why such bothersome things?
 If that's not done,
 the weak nations will be invaded by the strong nations in no time at all
 and may end up being controlled unilaterally.
 There's a point to mutual supervision. Probably.
 HmphΓÇª
 Of those cards,
 are there ones with detailed individual information?
 Yes, there areΓÇª
 Are there ones you're concerned about?
 Yes, there are!
 The information for the applicants this time around is not perfect,
 but is burned in and saved.
 You guys includedΓÇª
 About those ""ones you're concerned about,"" who you know.
 Anything's fine, tell me their information and I'll retrieve it for you.
 Gaara of the Sand Village, and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.
 Oh, you even know names.
 That makes it quick.
 Here they are!
 Please show me.
 Here they are!
 Please show me.
 I don't really get what's going on, but I'll pretend like I do.
 Well then, first is Rock Lee.
 He's one year older than you guys.
 His mission experience, twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.
 His squad leader is GuyΓÇª
 In just this year, his Taijutsu has drastically improved, but...
 His other skills are not good at all.
 Last year, he'd attracted attention as a Genin rookie with his ability,
 but didn't participate in the Chunin Exam.
 This is his first time taking the exams, same as you guysΓÇª
 Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his teamΓÇª
 Huh? Hyuga?
 NextΓÇªis Gaara of the Desert.
 His mission experience, eight C-ranks. B-ranksΓÇª
 Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, ehΓÇª
 He's a Shinobi from a different land and is a rookie,
 so there is no further detailed information.
 ButΓÇª
 It seems he has returned from all of his missions uninjured.
 B-rank as a GeninΓÇª But uninjuredΓÇª?!
 What is this guy?
 Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass, Waterfall, SoundΓÇª
 There are lots of exceptional Genins from those villages
 who have come to take the Exam this year as well.
 As far as the Village Hidden in Sound goes,
 it's a village of a small nation that just sprang up in recent years,
 so there isn't much informationΓÇª
 At any rate,
 they're all Hidden Villages with nothing but crackerjacks.
 That kind of makes you lose your confidence.
 Why are you saying that now?
 In other wordsΓÇª
 all of the applicants who have gathered hereΓÇª
 That's right!
 Not just Lee and Gaara,
 but they're all choice top elite Genin from each nation.
 Hmm.
 This isn't going to be easy.
 I can't go along with this!
 They may be your subordinates now,
 but they are children who were my students.
 If it's about them I knowΓÇª
 It's as you say, Iruka.
 It's not going to be that easy.
 You're too eager.
 I postponed my team's test-taking for one year
 and took care to build up their skills.
 Have them take the Exam after they've enjoyed their life a little bit more.
 HmphΓÇª
 They might be too easygoing.
 But they will surpass your guys in no time.
 That's enough.
 That's as far as the rookie matter goes.
 Now then, nextΓÇª
 I'll take recommendations for Genin other than rookies.
 Well! Don't pour cold water on thisΓÇª
 I said that, neverthelessΓÇª
 I wonder if even the fearless ones are frightened just this time around.
 Stubborn as he is,
 he's still consumed by this atmosphere and number of people.
 He's tense.
 It can't be helped.
 Even though everyone is a Genin, we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.
 I'm very, very uneasy.
 ButΓÇª
 It's kind of tough looking at Naruto who's not himself.
 Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.
 SayΓÇªNaruto! Don't be so scared.
 Huh?
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
 I won't lose to any of you! Got it?!
 Say! What's with him?!
 That idiot would never get depressed! Absurd!
 It won't do any good to provoke everyone!
 Don't tell me!
 If I don't tell it to you, who do I tell it to?!
 What did you say?!
 Oh, I feel better.
 HmphΓÇª
 Isn't that the guy from beforeΓÇª?
 The dog's bark is bigger than its bite.
 Is he an idiotΓÇª?
 He's mighty high-spirited.
 He's hot-headed, eh.
 Lee, maybe you did not bully him enough.
 Did you hear?
 Sound Village is a minor Hidden Village of a small nation.
 That's offensive.
 Maybe I'llΓÇªplay with them a bit.
 Yes, being referred to as something like leftover Shinobis and all.
 We'll add this to his data.
 Those Sound Shinobis are brutal in their own way.
 I won't lose to any of you, you say?
 You said itΓÇª!
 That idiotΓÇª
 In no time at all, he's made enemies of his surroundings.
 What're you talking big for?! You!
 But, I just said what was true, I say!
 E-Everyone, that was a joke.
 This guy's quite an idiot, you seeΓÇª
 After all, he says idiotic, spazzy, scatterbrained things
 and gets carried away,
 so please don't concern  yourself with him.
 Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!
 I'm going to kick your butt!
 Shall we do it?
 Let's do it.
 Learn how to read atmosphere already, you!
 Fine!
 These guysΓÇªare the Sound VillageΓÇª
 He dodged it!
 I can see through that speed.
 I seeΓÇª It's that kind of attack, eh?
 What's going on?
 He was supposed to have evaded it.
 Why'd that happen to his glasses?
 Probably grazed the tip of his nose.
 He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.
 Huh?!
 Oh! He puked?!
 K-Kabuto?
 Huh?!
 Hah!
 Hey, Kabuto!
 Are you okay?!
 YeahΓÇªI'm okay.
 Really?
 Oh, so he's not so special.
 Even though he's a veteran who's been taking the exams for four whole years.
 Write this on your card.
 The three from Sound villageΓÇª Doubtless Chunin.
 Kabuto should've totally read the attackΓÇª
 But why did he vomit?
 Lee. How about that technique just now?
 I had no problem reading the speed.
 There's some kind of trick...
 Silence! Degenerates!
 Sorry to keep you waitingΓÇªI
 I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 It feels like the chance to show off the fruits of our training has finally come.
 Well, no matter what kind of test it is,
 it's gonna be a snap!
 I'm picturing Sasuke and them bowing to me and saying,
 ""Naruto, we're really no match for you.""
 Huh? Is this for real?!

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)

 Naruto, Choji, gather all of them!
 I know!
 Yeah!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Pick it up! Pick it up!
 Over here!
 Over there!
 DonΓÇÖt lose any of them!
 Yeah!
 Pick it up!
 Over there!
 Go over there!
 Hey thatΓÇÖs mine!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Arm!
 Where did that bird go?
 Damn it! We lost it!
 Over there!
 Just a little moreΓÇª
 This is a mission believe it or not!
 This is something very importantΓÇª
 I beg youΓÇª Please let go of it!
 We have trouble, Lady Tsunade!
 What is it?!
 Those papers scattered throughout the village,
 are the plans that were stolen from the carpenter boss.
 Currently, Shikamaru and his team have finished collecting all the plans,
 and rechecking them.
 But it seems like they have collected all of them.
 What is the meaning of this?
 I have no ideaΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade! We have a report
 from those who headed to the Hidden Waterfall Village!
 Was there movement?!
 Actually, it turns out that it was only a large-scale practice run!
 They are saying that they see no signs of an invasion of Leaf Village.
 What?!
 It seems as though they have already finished their practice run,
 and the Hidden Waterfall Village is back to normal.
 So Genno and Hidden Waterfall Village have nothing to do with each otherΓÇª?
 Disengage the S-Level Emergency Security Alert!
 Order all forces back to village!
 Yes!
 What in the world was that man plotting?!
 Lady Tsunade!
 What now?!
 The body that the Anbu Black-Ops gatheredΓÇª
 It'sΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not GennoΓÇª?
 What does that mean?
 But I thought that Old Man Genno was cornered by the Anbu Black Ops
 and blew himself up.
 He traded places with a corpse that he had ready right before the explosionΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs a huge possibility!
 WeΓÇÖre in the middle of confirming that!
 Their appearances look similar, but small details bring up questions!
 Most likelyΓÇªitΓÇÖs another man.
 Are you telling me he fooled the Anbu Black Ops!
 That means, Genno isΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs still alive!
 Damn! What is that man up toΓÇª?
 Over there. Behind that tree.
 ItΓÇÖs here!
 I seeΓÇª The Old Man Genno used this hole to get away.
 He camouflaged it well.
 If it wasnΓÇÖt for the Byakugan, we would have missed it.
 Not only thatΓÇª
 This hole is made so that it closes naturally by the weight of the earth.
 If we came here another day later,
 it would have been extremely difficult to find,
 even with the Byakugan.
 And to prove that,
 you can barely see any sign of an entrance to this hole.
 Akamaru, can you follow his scent?
 HeΓÇÖs even got getting rid of his smell coveredΓÇª
 Where could he have gone?
 Our conclusion is thatΓÇª
 Old Man Genno is still alive
 and there's a possibility that he's hiding in Leaf Village.
 He got cornered, and faked his own suicide,
 and stole the plans so that he couldΓÇª
 make all of us turn our eyes outside of the village.
 He could have already known about the big practice run
 in the Hidden Waterfall Village and used that to his advantage.
 B-But the Anbu Black Ops started to mark Genno because
 they happened to find out that his letter of recommendation was a fake, right?
 Was it a coincidentΓÇª?
 IsnΓÇÖt it strange that a real letter of recommendation was
 at the house of the carpenter boss he worked for?
 Then what is his true goal?
 If we knew the answer to that, we wouldnΓÇÖt be struggling so muchΓÇª
 Shikamaru!
 The only thing I can say now isΓÇª
 The number of Shinobi in this village currently is at its lowest ever.
 We only have a bare minimum of us here!
 And most of their eyes are looking outside of the village.
 Even if Genno was walking around as he was humming on the streets,
 no one would suspect anything of him.
 Did he set a trap in the village?!
 Could the fact that that he scattered the plans around mean that
 heΓÇÖs already done setting his trap?
 No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.
 We canΓÇÖt leave this place without any security,
 but we have few peopleΓÇª
 Then where do we look?
 The Academy.
 The Academy?
 Why the Academy out of all the important facilities in the village?
 Out of all the sites Genno worked on,
 only the AcademyΓÇÖs repair plan was stolen.
 ItΓÇÖs hard to think that it was a coincidence
 for it to disappear at this timing.
 Byakugan!
 Well?
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing in this room.
 ThenΓÇªmove ahead to the next room.
 Byakugan!
 Seems like thereΓÇÖs nothing in this area
 CanΓÇÖt you look at the entire campus at once?
 And we have Hinata too, you know?
 That would be possible if we know what the target was,
 but weΓÇÖre looking for something suspicious.
 WeΓÇÖll have to take the basic route.
 Hey! Wait a minute!
 YouΓÇÖre in the way!
 And thereΓÇÖs too manyΓÇª people here.
 Like I said!
 All I want is for you guys to come outside even just for a moment!
 Our teacher told us to study on our own in the classroom for today!
 We canΓÇÖt go out of the room!
 There are no teachers today!
 So nobody would know if you left the class!
 We used to skip class when lruka Sensei wasnΓÇÖt looking
 when we were younger.
 Oh! A delinquent!
 ΓÇô Delinquent! 					ΓÇô Delinquent!
 We have to check this area!
 Besides, all the teachers have gone on a mission to protect the village.
 Why are you guys still here?
 They must be useless.
 What did you say?! WeΓÇÖre also protecting the village tooΓÇª
 Naruto. YouΓÇÖre wasting time
 LetΓÇÖs crush them!
 What?
 The Expansion Jutsu!
 WeΓÇÖre going to tell on you to our teacher!
 Yeah, do as you please!
 Idiot!
 LetΓÇÖs practice our Kunai Knives.
 Sounds good.
 It doesnΓÇÖt seem like thereΓÇÖs anything suspiciousΓÇª
 Hurry up!
 Wait!
 Come on. IΓÇÖm begging you to leave!
 Naruto!
 Where did those kids from the next classroom go?
 I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 They were going to practice their Kunai Knives.
 ThatΓÇÖs what they were saying.
 Oh, yeah, yeah. ThatΓÇÖs right.
 TheyΓÇÖre practicing their Kunai Knives in a place like that?
 IΓÇÖll do next.
 Ok. Do your best!
 Do it!
 Yeah!
 Oh, so close.
 They really are practicingΓÇª
 When we were students at the Academy,
 we used to skip class and come here.
 The teacherΓÇÖs couldnΓÇÖt find us here, it really was great!
 I read comic books, and took napsΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right, I ate potato chips.
 Well, thatΓÇÖs no good!
 You can learn something from those kids.
 Even if the teachers doesnΓÇÖt see you,
 you should still commit to your practice!
 TheyΓÇÖre true models of students!
 Wonderful! IΓÇÖm excited! IΓÇÖm moved!
 IΓÇÖd like to take class with them!
 We wouldnΓÇÖt want to interrupt. LetΓÇÖs go.
 YeahΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 What?
 Did they have that before?
 IΓÇÖm going to get this one!
 Ouch!
 I had it!
 It seems pretty new.
 Genno could have made itΓÇª
 I-IΓÇÖm going to get Neji or Hinata!
 You guys get out of the way.
 YouΓÇÖre getting in the way of our practice.
 O-Oh IΓÇÖm sorry!
 IΓÇÖm next!
 Byakugan!
 ItΓÇÖs a Paper Bomb! ltΓÇÖs hidden behind the wall!
 What, inside the wall?!
 ItΓÇÖs completely hidden inside the wall.
 But then how do you detonate itΓÇª?
 Oh, there she is.
 Hey! Hinata!
 Naruto.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Hinata, go out with me!
 Wh-What are you saying at a time like this?!
 Huh?
 I-I don't knowΓÇª Go out with you?
 You wonΓÇÖt?
 I-IΓÇÖm not necessarily saying noΓÇª
 Then IΓÇÖll just ask Neji then. See you later!
 What?
 ThereΓÇÖs a thin thread attached to the Paper Bomb.
 A thread?
 ItΓÇÖs probably a special thread used to ignite it.
 He's probably is going to detonate it from a distanceΓÇª
 Where is that thread connected to?!
 It goes around the classroom andΓÇª
 It goes outsideΓÇª towards the training hallΓÇª?
 ThereΓÇÖs a log standingΓÇª
 ThisΓÇª Could it be?!
 Neji! Come with me for a second!
 What is it! WeΓÇÖre in the middle of somethingΓÇª
 Actually thereΓÇÖs a strange log standing in the training hall over there.
 We wanted him to check it.
 ThatΓÇÖs the triggering device!
 Huh?
 Try loosening up your shoulders and then throw it.
 Shut up.
 All right, IΓÇÖm up next.
 There should be a target on the log.
 Yeah, there is.
 The center of the target is the triggering device!
 When a Kunai Knife hits the centerΓÇª
 the device will activateΓÇª
 And the Academy will explode!
 So close!
 If you focus, youΓÇÖll hit the target.
 All right, IΓÇÖm going to hit this time.
 FocusΓÇª
 And target!
 DonΓÇÖt let anybody hit the target!
 All right, I hit the target!
 You did it!
 Oh?
 The tip is cracked. You always have to take care of your tools.
 Damn, I thought that I hit the target.
 This way! Behind there!
 All rightΓÇª IΓÇÖm going to hit it for sure!
 ThatΓÇÖs the spirit!
 This looks good!
 This time IΓÇÖm going to hit it!
 Bushy Brow!
 Stop it, Lee!
 What?
 Oh, did I scare you?
 IΓÇÖm sorry. I just dropped my Ninja toolΓÇª Here.
 Bushy Brow, you did it!
 I had the target!
 Why did you get in the way?!
 Be quiet! lf that had hit the target,
 the Academy would have exploded!
 WhatΓÇª?
 For real?
 A triggering device in hereΓÇªhuh?
 When something hits the center, the Academy explodes.
 So there hasnΓÇÖt been anyone whoΓÇÖs been able to hit the center.
 We really were lucky.
 We were lucky, huh?
 So who started to practice throwing their Kunai-Knife here?
 Who? Who was it?
 Somebody told us that we'd be praised
 if we got better at Kunai-Knife throwing in secret from the teachers.
 ""in secret from from the teachersΓÇª""
 Whoever mustΓÇÖve used Genjutsu to make them think that.
 It must be Genno.
 What happened?
 W-WellΓÇª There's more than one thread coming out of the triggering device.
 Is that true Hinata?
 YeahΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 True. There's not just oneΓÇªtwoΓÇªno, three?
 Where are they connected to?
 Outside of the academyΓÇª 					No!
 Wait! ItΓÇÖs hard to see from here.
 U-UmmΓÇª M-Me tooΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 Byakugan!
 I found one.
 I found one, too
 Tell us the location.
 No, wait. The thread splits again.
 Over here tooΓÇª
 Th-This isΓÇª
 NoΓÇªwayΓÇª
 It can't beΓÇª
 Hey! WhatΓÇÖs the matter!
 ThereΓÇÖs Paper Bombs planted all over the village!
 ItΓÇÖs not just 10 or 20ΓÇª
 It's countless numbers of them!
 What?!
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves is a nest of Paper Bombs!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardustΓÇÖs are rapidly dancing
 I just canΓÇÖt come out and say, ΓÇ£Ah, I donΓÇÖt want to go home yet.ΓÇ¥
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs from that coke I just drank?
 ΓÇô Now, the Academy is safe. ΓÇô All right!
 ItΓÇÖs too early to feel relieved.
 If he realizes the Paper Bombs are being deactivated,
 he might blow up the village by a different method.
 Then we have to evacuate everyone quickly!
 ΓÇô Then he'll know what we're doing! ΓÇô That meansΓÇª
 Pretend we donΓÇÖt notice anything and get rid of the Paper Bombs.
 Everyone, get to it at once!
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yes.

 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 WhereΓÇÖs Naruto?
 ItΓÇÖs no good. I canΓÇÖt find him.
 I seeΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs not close by anymore.
 Either he drifted awayΓÇª
 or he has escaped.
 At any rate, with this fogΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no reason to remain here any longer.
 LetΓÇÖs make it to a shore nearby and start again.
 Understood.
 The Closed Door
 ItΓÇÖs been a while, Lord Orochimaru.
 It truly has.
 To think IΓÇÖd stop by on a whim to find you still here.
 And itΓÇÖs for that reason that I am able to meet with you again.
 So does the fact that youΓÇÖre here mean
 you're still continuing that research?
 Yes.
 And I think someday it will be of help to you, Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 I wonder if thatΓÇÖs true.
 And all this is due to my loyalty.
 Do whatever you likeΓÇª
 Thank you.
 By the wayΓÇª
 is he the one you were talking of earlier?
 Yes, heΓÇÖs Itachi UchihaΓÇÖs younger brother.
 Oh reallyΓÇª
 Yes, myΓÇª
 Please donΓÇÖtΓÇª
 say anything unnecessary!
 It appears that Naruto is no longer close by.
 HeyΓÇª
 Naruto, surely heΓÇÖs safe, isnΓÇÖt heΓÇª?
 He canΓÇÖt be beaten that easily.
 After all, he too is a Leaf ShinobiΓÇª
 Shiragiku Inn 		 IΓÇÖm responsible for guarding 		the ships collecting funds.
 IΓÇÖm Hitode.
 I know the circumstances,
 your colleague has disappeared and IΓÇÖm sure that youΓÇÖre worriedΓÇª
 Have you received any information since then?
 IΓÇÖm sorry, but thereΓÇÖs been no information
 regarding a victim rescued from a shipwreck.
 I see.
 However, I'm troubled.
 This is difficult to say,
 but the departure of the collection ships has been pushed forwardΓÇª
 Pushed forward?
 Now weΓÇÖre scheduled to leave tomorrow morning.
 We apologize for our late notice.
 As expected, a large number of people find
 the relationship with Land of Water very important
 and we had to push the departure forward.
 I understand.
 But weΓÇÖd like to take time here
 to seek and investigate our colleagueΓÇª
 Of course.
 WeΓÇÖll meet you directly at the port tomorrow
 for the guard duty.
 Thank you for cooperating.
 Just one thing.
 YesΓÇª
 As you can see, we are not a very wealthy country.
 Fishermen and we are both concerned
 about the disturbance of this Demon of the Ocean.
 We greatly appreciate for your help with our country.
 I understand.
 ThatΓÇÖs right, IΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve come to?
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 Hey, youΓÇÖre the girl from yesterdayΓÇª!
 I get it now!
 You saved me, thank you!
 It just happenedΓÇª
 No, seriously you saved me.
 Oh, IΓÇÖm Naruto Uzumaki. WhatΓÇÖs your name?
 Isaribi.
 So Isaribi, youΓÇÖre the girl who saved my life.
 Why did you come to this remote area?
 A mission, of course!
 To exterminate the Demon of the Ocean that has been troubling this country!
 It would be best to quit.
 You won't get away easily if you get involved with the Demon of the Ocean.
 You don't need to worry. Anyway, this is a mission.
 We were careless yesterday,
 but next time weΓÇÖll catch that Demon of the Ocean--!
 ThatΓÇÖs hot!
 SoΓÇªyou feel fine now?
 Yep! Thanks to you, itΓÇÖs excellent, believe it!
 Then, once youΓÇÖve eaten that, get out.
 Huh?
 What? What?
 Wait, Isaribi!
 Hey!
 IsaribiΓÇª WaitΓÇª
 Huh, wha--?
 Monster! Go away!
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 ItΓÇÖs the work of some brats from the village.
 If I let it bother me, thereΓÇÖs no end to it.
 Oh, IsaribiΓÇª
 Really, thank you so much.
 SheΓÇÖs out, the monster!
 What theΓÇª?
 Get out of here!
 YouΓÇÖre bad luck
 Take this!
 I-IsaribiΓÇª
 Stop it, brats!
 ΓÇô Disappear! ΓÇô Get out of here!
 Say something!
 Hey, stop! All of you!
 YouΓÇÖre taking your pranks a little too far!
 Who are you?! A friend of this monster?!
 Monster?
 EveryoneΓÇÖs saying it.
 Isaribi was spirited away
 and became friends with the Demon of the Ocean!
 DonΓÇÖt say such irresponsible things!
 ItΓÇÖs true!
 Ouch!
 ΓÇô Run! 					ΓÇô Stupid guy!
 ΓÇô Hey! Who you calling stupid?! ΓÇô Stop!
 What?! ButΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okayΓÇª
 Leave me alone.
 I canΓÇÖt leave you alone!
 If they keep doing thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm saying that itΓÇÖs none of your business!
 IΓÇÖm the girl who was spirited away.
 So itΓÇÖs natural that people find me creepy.
 But thatΓÇÖs not your fault!
 That doesnΓÇÖt matter.
 Humans donΓÇÖt let those who are different from them
 into their group.
 SoΓÇª
 Your colleague was lost at seaΓÇª
 We thought that if a boat left port between the evening and morning
 maybe they saw somethingΓÇª
 Sorry, but I donΓÇÖt think I can help.
 Because of the Demon of the Ocean,
 people of this village stay away from the port at those times.
 I see.
 HeΓÇÖs been spirited away.
 That Demon of the Ocean took someone away again.
 Mother, donΓÇÖt say such reckless things.
 Spirited awayΓÇª
 I heard that at the port, too.
 Can you give me details about this spiriting away?
 What good will talking about it do?
 ButΓÇª
 Please forgive me.
 This isnΓÇÖt something to be talked about with outsiders.
 Can we do something about that, please?
 We came here to exterminate the Demon of the Ocean.
 Exterminate the Demon of the Ocean?
 I seeΓÇª
 For a long time,
 thereΓÇÖs been a legend among fishermen on Demon Island.
 A legend?
 Yes, the legend says donΓÇÖt come near Demon Island,
 ΓÇ£the island where demons live.ΓÇ¥
 Demon Island has always been a fishing area rich in fish,
 but there were many hidden reefs and it was a dangerous marine areaΓÇª
 So everybody obeyed the legend.
 But one unusually cool summer about ten years ago,
 the fish disappeared from the seaΓÇª
 We couldnΓÇÖt help it,
 so my husband and I set our feet into the dangerous marine area.
 It was a large catch.
 But when I happily came to the surface of the ocean,
 I saw an empty boat with my husband nowhere to be seen.
 Ever since then, one after the next,
 anyone who approaches that island disappeared.
 Also, people who went to search didnΓÇÖt return.
 Since then people from the village stay away from the island
 where spiriting away occurs.
 An island nobody goes nearΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs a peculiar story.
 Speaking of which, I heard that
 thereΓÇÖs a girl who returned from being spirited away.
 Oh, yesΓÇª Isaribi.
 MaΓÇÖam, IΓÇÖve got another favor.
 Please tell me where she lives!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade!
 Yes?
 Geez. HereΓÇÖs the data you requested.
 ThatΓÇÖs the Land of SeaΓÇÖsΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre worried, after all.
 HmΓÇª Well, yesΓÇª
 The Land of Sea is where Anko, abandoned by Orochimaru, was foundΓÇª
 Hey! Are you okay!
 ItΓÇÖs no goodΓÇª I canΓÇÖt remember.
 Even though I should knowΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs dark and coldΓÇª
 I was in painΓÇª ButΓÇª
 Calm downΓÇª Try taking a little more time.
 IΓÇÖm sure I even got this strange mark while thereΓÇª
 The suggestion is deep.
 Her entire memory is most likely allΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs enoughΓÇª YouΓÇÖve had some tough times.
 ItΓÇÖs okay.
 Right now, weΓÇÖll treat this Curse Mark thatΓÇÖs eating away at youΓÇª
 We have to do that first.
 Lord HokageΓÇª
 IΓÇª
 In the end, her memory didnΓÇÖt returnΓÇª
 A part of AnkoΓÇÖs memory remains lost even now.
 So thatΓÇÖs what happenedΓÇª
 So, this is the first time AnkoΓÇÖs been to the Land of Sea since that incident?
 YesΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs right.
 It would be nice if it could be a catalyst
 for bringing back her memoriesΓÇª
 What?!
 Missed each other?!
 They came here?!
 Yeah, you should follow them right away!
 And, which way did they go?
 That way!
 ThatΓÇÖs the direction I came!
 Damn! Everybody wait up!
 The collection ship is moving.
 I see, the only girl who returned from being spirited away.
 I thought we should at least go seeΓÇª
 She may have some information about Demon Island!
 Stop!
 Oh! That girl!
 Sensei!
 I wonder where she intends to go?
 SheΓÇÖs cautious.
 LetΓÇÖs follow without being noticed.
 Hey, everybody! Oh, cΓÇÖmon.
 If I keep going like this,
 I'll go all the way to lsaribi's house again.
 That appearanceΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be, youΓÇÖre the Demon of the OceanΓÇª?
 What?!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you escape!
 Master OrochimaruΓÇª This isΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm going to teach you something special.
 This is one of the rooms where I develop JutsuΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like you to help, too.
 ButΓÇªif the village knew about thisΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not going as smoothly as I hoped.
 It only needs one more stepΓÇª
 Silly, thereΓÇÖs nothing to be afraid of.
 The really frightening thing is to neglect pursuing the truth.
 That girl, could she beΓÇª?
 Give it up! You canΓÇÖt escape!
 You were the Demon of the Ocean!
 Hey, everyone!
 Hey!
 I finally found you!
 Naruto, youΓÇÖre safeΓÇª
 But Naruto, youΓÇÖre too late.
 Too late?
 We caught the Demon of the Ocean! Look, this is it.
 Oh! Oh?
 Huh, so this is the Demon of the Ocean?!
 IsaribiΓÇª
 Huh?!
 IsaribiΓÇª YouΓÇÖre Isaribi, arenΓÇÖt you?!
 Naruto! What are you talking about?!
 Just wait! Isaribi! lsaribi, answer me!
 Damn it!
 Wait up, you!
 Wait, donΓÇÖt be rough.
 Explanation must wait.
 WeΓÇÖre in trouble if we let her escape here.
 Who are you?! Give Isaribi back!
 Like that will happen!
 She's an important guinea pig.
 If she's lost, I'm responsible for it.
 Bastard!
 DonΓÇÖt chase too farΓÇª ltΓÇÖll be yesterday all over again.
 But!
 Crap!
 No question about itΓÇª
 That girlΓÇª
 Sensei!
 What in the world is going on?!
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Geez! What the heck are you thinking?!
 What do you intend to do alone?!
 But I canΓÇÖt just leave her be!
 Even if you were to go after her,
 you donΓÇÖt even have any leads in the first place!
 No, not quite!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 It seems thereΓÇÖs an island at the center of this landΓÇÖs spiriting away.
 I get it. Demon Island!
 LetΓÇÖs go after her! As for me, I canΓÇÖt just leave her be, believe it!

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,

 Who knows what kind of powerful foe is waiting for us?!

 Heeeey! Sasuke!
 YouΓÇÖve got to be kidding, loser.
 All right!
 I caught you off guard! Lucky!

 SasukeΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt just stand there, Sakura!
 No guarantee this guy's alone!
 Got it?!
 If you let your guard down youΓÇÖll really get killedΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs unlucky! I came on my own to conceal my presence,
 but that became my enemyΓÇª
 He got away, huhΓÇª?
 If thereΓÇÖs an instance that we become separated,
 donΓÇÖt trust him if he looks like your teammate.
 Just like now thereΓÇÖs a possibility
 that an enemy will transform to get close to us!
 ΓÇô Yeah. 					ΓÇô So what do we do?
 WeΓÇÖll decide on a password.
 Password?
 Listen, if the password is incorrect, no matter what he looks likeΓÇª
 presume he is an enemy!
 IΓÇÖll only say it once, so listen closely.
 You ask,  Ninja song, ΓÇ£Ninja Chance.ΓÇ¥
 And the answer is this:
 ΓÇ£The chance to sneak up when a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 ΓÇ£The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 ΓÇ£It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 ΓÇ£The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.ΓÇ¥
 ThatΓÇÖs it.
 Okay!
 Could you say it again?
 Huh?!
 I told you IΓÇÖd only say it once.
 Could it be that you couldnΓÇÖt memorize it?
 ΓÇô You fool! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 I got it right away!
 I-I memorized it perfectly!
 I thought just in case, IΓÇÖd listen one more timeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll carry the scroll!
 Hey, wait Sasuke.
 Ouch!
 What is it?
 A new enemy?!
 You guys go play around ΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll go aloneΓÇª

 Sasuke!

 First the passwordΓÇª
 Ninja song, ΓÇ£Ninja ChanceΓÇ¥!
 Ah! UmmΓÇª
 The chance to sneak up where a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.
 Good.
 Owwww!
 Hey everyone, are you okay?
 Naruto, wait!
 The passwordΓÇª
 I knowΓÇª
 The chance to sneak up where a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 What are you doing?!
 This time itΓÇÖs someone who can dodge my attack, huh?
 What are you saying, Sasuke?
 Naruto just said the password properly.
 He was able to say it,  thatΓÇÖs the problem!
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô Wha--?
 Do you really think that guy can remember a password that long?
 Oh!
 If we asked the normal Naruto what the password is,
 what do you think heΓÇÖd say?
 ΓÇ£Sorry. IΓÇÖve forgotten it.ΓÇ¥
 Besides, his movements when he avoided my attackΓÇª
 It was clearly different from NarutoΓÇÖs!
 Show your true self already, fake one!
 ThatΓÇÖs how it is, huhΓÇª
 But if you knew he would forget it,
 why didnΓÇÖt you make the password shorter?
 I knew that you were underground
 eavesdropping on our conversation.
 So I chose that password on purpose.
 Oh really. So youΓÇÖre not tired or letting your guard down.
 This will be more fun than I thought.
 This personΓÇÖsΓÇªtoo creepy!
 And whereΓÇÖs Naruto?
 Huh?
 Owww!
 And heave!
 Huh? Where are Sakura and that Sasuke?

 Well, letΓÇÖs beginΓÇª

 No, that's not it.
 This is simply a thirst for blood.
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 Just looking at her eyes made me think of death.
 Who is thisΓÇªwoman?!

 ItΓÇÖs no good.
 We have no choice but to flee here.
 Unless we do, the only thing waiting for us isΓÇª

 I canΓÇÖt move!
 DonΓÇÖt worry. IΓÇÖll end this in a second.

 A lot happened between him and me.
 Even though we always squabbled,
 we cooperated and saved Kakashi Sensei in that encounter with Zabuza.
 During our Chakra training in forest,
 we competed each other and practiced climbing up trees.
 ThatΓÇÖs it! I havenΓÇÖtΓÇª

 ΓÇô More rice! 					ΓÇô More rice!

 How do we fleeΓÇª?
 How should we escapeΓÇª?

 so worked up.

 Shoot! I was too shaken up to notice the snake!

 before a predator.
 Ahh... Huh?!
 Sorry Sasuke..
 Naruto!
 The passwordΓÇª I forgot it!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, hey , hey!
 It looks like you bullied weaklings while I was gone.
 That explosion and that huge snake,
 it's all your fault, isn't it?
 You darn snake bastard!
 Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki, is here, I'll wipe the floor with you!

 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 The Enemy of the Byakugan
 They blew upΓÇª They blew up and died!
 As I expected, IΓÇÖm not sad.
 You really canΓÇÖt hold funerals feeling like this, huhΓÇª
 Four of them are still alive.
 CanΓÇÖt be! After being hit by my Lightning FangΓÇª
 NoΓÇª
 If you say so, it has to be true.
 OneΓÇªis troublesomeΓÇª
 The enemy was nearbyΓÇª But I couldnΓÇÖt see anything.
 ItΓÇÖs strangeΓÇª
 Even if itΓÇÖs the Hidden Mist Jutsu,
 my Byakugan should be able to see through it.
 Byakugan!
 For sure this timeΓÇª
 I can see it!
 Southwest 52 degrees 2!
 Southeast 12 degrees 3!

 We canΓÇÖt hold funerals,
 but IΓÇÖll take care of them without leaving any trace.

 The corpses are warm.
 WeΓÇÖre strongΓÇªyou and I.
 No, itΓÇÖs you.
 Ranmaru, youΓÇÖre strong. With you IΓÇÖm also strong.
 WaitΓÇª They arenΓÇÖt dead yet. TheyΓÇÖre just unconscious.
 TheyΓÇÖre stubborn.
 Okay, if grilling doesnΓÇÖt work, then letΓÇÖs chop them.

 He is fighting only with muscle memory.

 I am sure it will be one that will make me cry!

 In my dreamΓÇª
 I guess you were the one I was fighting against.
 It wasnΓÇÖt meΓÇª lt was Raiga and me togetherΓÇª
 TogetherΓÇª?
 AlwaysΓÇªsince that timeΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt act like youΓÇÖre asleep. You are going to dieΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt move!
 There is a spy in this village who snuck into the Hidden Mist VillageΓÇª
 We came to kill those guys, butΓÇª
 I got confused about who I had to kill. ThatΓÇÖs why I am doing it randomlyΓÇª
 Wh-What are you saying?
 ItΓÇÖs fineΓÇª lf I am going to be killed by you.
 HuhΓÇª? Why is it fine for me to kill youΓÇª?
 You wereΓÇªalways cryingΓÇª
 Huh? MeΓÇªcry?
 In your heartΓÇª seeking the meaning of living.
 I was always watchingΓÇªyou.
 WhatΓÇªare you?
 I am the same as youΓÇª living is painful.
 I donΓÇÖt understand the meaning of living.
 Because of my sickness, I couldnΓÇÖt go outsideΓÇª
 Shunned by everyone,
 all I could do was to take a peek of the world from this blanketΓÇª
 But ΓÇªif with my death,
 if you are able to feel the meaning of life even a littleΓÇª
 My life was not needed from the beginning.
 PleaseΓÇª
 Are youΓÇªalone?
 Come with me.
 From now on, you and I are two as one.
 From that day on, I became RaigaΓÇÖs eyes and ears.
 Raiga became my hands and feet.
 The outside world that I dashed into for the very first timeΓÇª
 it was filled with things I had never seen or heard before.
 It was fun.
 Whenever and wherever, I was with Raiga.
 No matter when it was,
 there wasnΓÇÖt a time that we were separated.
 We were trying to find the meaning of life by living for each other.
 We were convinced that was the meaning to living.
 ThatΓÇÖs whyΓÇª
 If Raiga is not around,
 I no longer have the power to live by myself.
 IΓÇÖve lost the purpose to liveΓÇª
 Do you have someone precious to you?
 I want to protect someone important to meΓÇª
 I want to make his dream come true, and thatΓÇÖs my dream.
 Often people have it wrongΓÇª
 mistakenly believing that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness.
 They spare the foe whose life is in their hands.
 ItΓÇÖs not mercy to me at allΓÇª
 Do you know the agony of just living without dreams and being unwanted?
 What are you saying?
 Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi. YouΓÇÖve taken away my reason for living.
 I no longer need to live.
 DonΓÇÖt say such stupid things.
 NarutoΓÇª Please kill me!
 Huh?
 What are you doing?
 Now, quickly.
 Why are you hesitatingΓÇª?
 With my arms and legs torn apart, I have no means to resist, you know.
 You should carry out your missionΓÇª.
 Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.
 Our mission is to force out the Kurosuki Family from this villageΓÇª
 Without Raiga, he cannot be of any threat to this village.
 The problem right now is that
 the Kurosuki Family members have lost their leadership.
 Once the hoop comes off, we donΓÇÖt know what they will do.
 For this missionΓÇª this is the finishing touch.
 Yeah, but what are we going to do with him?
 Is he a villain worth tying up?
 No, he is not.
 He might kill himself, right?
 Once the mission is over, we will come save you right awayΓÇª
 A Chakra Sealing tag?
 We canΓÇÖt help it. He is an enemy, after allΓÇª
 We should assume he has other Jutsu. Just in case!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Rokusuke and the others went back to the village,
 so I say the mission is complete.
 Except Lee.
 Oh, oh yeah.
 Bushy Brow said he was going to straighten KarashiΓÇÖs spirit.
 I wonder if itΓÇÖs going to be that easy.
 It seems like there will be some trouble.
 Hey, why are you saying that?!
 No, not Karashi, but this weather.

 He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!
 Looks like he extracted the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox
 all on his own this time.
 But still, one certainly canΓÇÖt say heΓÇÖs stable yetΓÇª
 He overused the large CharkaΓÇª
 To think that of all the frogs he summoned that oneΓÇª
 I did itΓÇª
 Hey, you little brat!
 Huh?
 Huh? Huh? Huh?!
 You little bratΓÇª
 On whose head do you think youΓÇÖre raising a ruckus!
 This is the top of Gamabunta, the Chief ToadΓÇÖs head! You idiot!
 Quiet downΓÇª
 Oh!
 W-What the heck is this guy?!
 He seems pretty awesome, butΓÇª
 Gimme a break!
 Just when IΓÇÖm breathing the air of the free world after a long time,
 some weird kid is raising a ruckus on top of my head.
 Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!
 What the heck do you think youΓÇÖre doing?!
 HmmΓÇª This doesnΓÇÖt look goodΓÇª
 ΓÇÖCause even I canΓÇÖt handle that GamabuntaΓÇª
 Jiraiya! Hurry up and show yourself, you idiot!
 HmmmΓÇªlt would be troublesome if that Gama found me outΓÇª
 I better get my ass out of here without any further delay.
 Hey, little brat!
 Y-YesΓÇª?
 WhereΓÇÖs Jiraiya?
 HuhΓÇª? JiraiyaΓÇª?
 WhoΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm talking about that lecher who calls himself Toad Sage or something!
 WhereΓÇÖs Jiraiya? Huh?!
 S-ScaryΓÇª
 If you just follow my orders,
 I wouldnΓÇÖt mind making you my henchman!
 Hurry up and answer me!
 Okay! If youΓÇÖre talking about the Pervy Sage,
 heΓÇÖs on the cliff up there, Chief Toad.
 Up there, huhΓÇª?
 UmΓÇª Can I ask you one question?
 What is it?
 What business do you have with that Pervy Sage?
 ThatΓÇÖs the question I want to ask that pervert!
 What the heck does he want summoning me to a place like this?!
 B-ButΓÇª
 What is it?
 IΓÇÖm the one who summoned you, Chief Toad..
 I fell off the cliffΓÇª
 and thought maybe you could come to my aidΓÇª
 PleaseΓÇª
 HmmΓÇª?
 What does a kid like you think heΓÇÖs saying out of the blue.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way a little squirt like you could summon a guy like me.
 ItΓÇÖsΓÇªitΓÇÖs trueΓÇª I really truly summoned youΓÇª
 Believe it!
 You jerk frog!
 HuhΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖve been condescending to me
 and saying whatever you please since earlier on!
 Since I summoned you, IΓÇÖm your master!
 HuhΓÇª? What was that?
 Hey, who do you think youΓÇÖre talking to?!
 A little squirt like you,
 who isnΓÇÖt even able to exchange cups of sake as a pledge of friendship,
 is saying to Lord Gamabunta, that youΓÇÖre his master?
 I could kill you for that! Hey!
 HuhΓÇª
 OohhhΓÇª
 It looks like he emerged on top, that GamabuntaΓÇª
 AwesomeΓÇª
 I hate to tell you this, little brat,
 but even if I were to concede a hundred steps to youΓÇª
 No, concede a thousand steps to you,
 and even if it really was true that it was you who summoned meΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre the kind of guy who falls off my back that easily,
 thereΓÇÖs no way I could admit you as my masterΓÇª
 Huh?! HuhΓÇª?!
 Now thenΓÇªIΓÇÖm here in the free world after a long timeΓÇª
 If Jiraiya doesnΓÇÖt have any business with me,
 I think IΓÇÖll kick back for a while.
 Hey! Wait!
 Why donΓÇÖt you just go home and sleep or something?
 ΓÇÖCause it looks like youΓÇÖre incapable of serving even as my henchman.
 Darn it!
 W-What the heck do you think youΓÇÖre doing, you little brat?
 If my making you recognize that I summoned you
 depends on my not falling off your back, thenΓÇª!
 Then I wonΓÇÖt get off your back the entire day today no matter what!
 What?!
 And by my doing that IΓÇÖll make you recognize me as your master!
 You little brat! DonΓÇÖt get all carried away thinking IΓÇÖll go easy on you!
 Huh?!

 ThereΓÇÖs not enough Chakra!
 Listen carefully, Chief Toad!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki!

 I thought you were told not to let Gaara out of your sightΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt worryΓÇª even somebody like himΓÇª
 wouldnΓÇÖt dare to do anything in broad daylight.
 More importantly, that guy Shikamaru or whatever,
 heΓÇÖs the first guy youΓÇÖre fighting, right?
 ShouldnΓÇÖt you be formulating a battle plan?
 HumphΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs no way I would lose to a guy of that levelΓÇª
 BesidesΓÇª
 You botched it, didnΓÇÖt you?
 Huh?
 If you had taken the exam one year earlier,
 you would have made the Chunin easilyΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt say itΓÇª
 What was that?!
 The upcoming Chunin ExamΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll have the three of you from our Sand Village take the examΓÇª
 But the reason for doing that is not to pass the Chunin Exam!
 It is to use the opportunity of the Chunin ExamΓÇª
 to crush Leaf Village!
 But whyΓÇª? DonΓÇÖt we have a treaty with Leaf Village?!
 That treaty is the problem.
 Oh.
 What do you mean?
 You Genin are not aware of the detail butΓÇª
 At the time the treaty was concluded,
 that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind not only aggressively scaled down
 the arsenal of the Hidden Sand VillageΓÇª
 he delegated to the Leaf Village
 matters that should have been handled by our country, and moreover,
 significantly cut our country's budget and slashed the number of Shinobi.
 When we have an idiot leader,
 we, the arms and legs of the country, suffer.
 The only choice we had left was to improve the quality
 of each and every Shinobi in order to maintain our countryΓÇÖs military powerΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why Shinobi like you were createdΓÇª
 GaaraΓÇª
 The Land of WindΓÇÖs security is in extreme danger right now!
 But the aides of that idiot feudal lordΓÇª
 donΓÇÖt have a clue!
 Lord Kazekage ,
 who detected the weakening in the military strength of the Hidden Sand Village,
 joined hands with the Hidden Sound Village
 and decided to take down the Hidden Leaf VillageΓÇª
 In addition to restoring Sand Village authorityΓÇª
 this needs to be done in order to make that idiot feudal lord
 aware of the importance of crisis preparednessΓÇª
 If any more time passes, our Sand Village will totally lose
 its military capabilities against the Leaf Village ΓÇª
 Now is the only chance ΓÇª
 The success of that missionΓÇª GaaraΓÇªdepends on your workΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª
 If the strategy is carried out,
 it will certainly lead to war with the Leaf Village.
 WeΓÇÖll be at war againΓÇª?
 The cost to human life in implementing the treaty was very greatΓÇª
 and if it is brokenΓÇªthen againΓÇª many people will dieΓÇª
 H-HeyΓÇªTemariΓÇª
 This is the will of Lord Kazekage.
 Of Lord Kazekage?
 After all, Shinobi are simply tools for fighting.
 The treaty did nothing more than jeopardize our very existence.
 This is a super A-rank mission.
 See it through with great care!
 Okay.
 YesΓÇª
 A day sure is long when oneΓÇÖs not doing anything.
 I guessΓÇª
 DarnΓÇª What an obstinate little squirt.
 GoodnessΓÇªthat Naruto seems like heΓÇÖs in agonyΓÇª
 He must have exhausted most of his Chakra
 when he summoned GamabuntaΓÇª
 Look, look, isnΓÇÖt that prettyΓÇª
 The rainbowΓÇª
 GorgeousΓÇª
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isnΓÇÖt it.
 Good work, Baki.
 Lord Kazekage, I successfully moved all three pawns
 to the real battle as planned.
 The agreement with the Sound Village side has been progressing with no problem too.
 Yes, sir.
 This isΓÇª
 A decisive action plan from the Sound Village.
 You still have something you want?
 WellΓÇª
 What is it? Come out with it.
 Yes, sirΓÇªI was wondering if you could position some soldiers
 near the border on the pretext of undertaking a tactical exercise.
 With only the four of usΓÇª
 The Leaf Village isnΓÇÖt idiot either.
 Their Anbu black ops are moving about.
 If we do that, they will see right through what weΓÇÖre contemplating.
 But with only our current military capabilityΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why I sent Gaara and the others out there.
 The restoration of the authority of the Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.
 WellΓÇª Go.
 Yes, sir.
 ThereΓÇÖs only a little more time remaining until the sun sets completelyΓÇª
 and if I donΓÇÖt fall offΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll be the master!
 WhatΓÇÖs that to me?!
 You came up with this whole thing unilaterally.
 IΓÇÖm not falling off, no matter what!
 That NarutoΓÇª heΓÇÖs already way past his limitΓÇª
 I wouldnΓÇÖt be surprised if he fell off any minute nowΓÇª
 I could simply ignore what a brat like him saysΓÇª
 but taking a lick really irritates me.
 I'm gonna bring this to an end once and for all...
 Hey, bratΓÇªwhatΓÇÖs your name?
 Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto UzumakiΓÇª Naruto!
 DonΓÇÖt hold it against me if you die!
 OhΓÇª
 That Gamabunta!
 Now itΓÇÖs a matter of pride for him, too!
 Huh?!
 This wonΓÇÖt do!
 No! This is the sizzling young ladiesΓÇÖ entertainment spot!
 IΓÇÖm not falling off when IΓÇÖm so close to succeeding!
 Hey!
 OhΓÇª
 What?!
 That NarutoΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs squeezing out yet more Chakra from that condition heΓÇÖs in.
 IΓÇÖm fallingΓÇª
 How do you like that, Gamabunta? IΓÇÖm still on your back!
 ItΓÇÖs my victory!
 Oh no! If he falls like that heΓÇÖll die!
 Too bad for youΓÇª You almost made it.
 To think that he could hold out like that against a tough opponent like GamabuntaΓÇª
 Hm?!
 That, Jiraiya, meddling inΓÇª
 I am fully aware of the fact thatΓÇª
 this guy here summoned me all on his own.
 I mean, itΓÇÖs the first time since the Fourth Hokage
 that somebody climbed on my head.
 As might be expected, he must be totally drained.
 I donΓÇÖt mind dispensing some of my power to him butΓÇª
 Taking him to that place would be best.

 It really couldnΓÇÖt be helped in light of the situationΓÇª
 No. I should have tried even harder to stop him.
 But IΓÇª
 Iruka, Naruto, I beg you!
 Please take me with you!
 TsubakiΓÇª
 I understand that IΓÇÖm making an impossible request!
 But I want to stop him, no matter what!
 Iruka Sensei!
 Tsubaki, I understand how you feel.
 In that caseΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry, but I cannot allow that.
 But whyΓÇª?
 Why canΓÇÖt she?!
 Naruto, we must hurry up and search for Mizuki!
 If sheΓÇÖs with us, sheΓÇÖll interfere with our mission!
 ButΓÇª ButΓÇª!
 IrukaΓÇª If thatΓÇÖs the case, I think I'll be of service to you.
 I have an idea of where he might be heading!
 Is that true, Tsubaki?!
 ThereΓÇÖs probably no mistakeΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 I beg you!
 I think itΓÇÖs certain
 that heΓÇÖll use various tricks to camouflage his tracks as he fleesΓÇª
 If we spend time on thatΓÇª it will all be too late!
 Please take me with you!
 Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23ΓÇª
 Huh, what was the result?
 The Ninja Herb: Creeping SaxifrageΓÇª
 Huh?! Who are you!
 Dragon, Rooster, DogΓÇª
 The lookouts have been taken down!
 ItΓÇÖs an intruder!
 What?!
 The Nara ClanΓÇÖs research lab was attacked?!
 YesΓÇª I just received a dispatch from the Nara ClanΓÇª
 According to the dispatch,
 the insurgentΓÇÖs physical characteristics match those of Mizuki.
 MizukiΓÇÖsΓÇª?
 Yes!
 What is that Naruto doing?
 But itΓÇÖs something to have come up with the idea of the Nara ClanΓÇÖs instituteΓÇª
 Notwithstanding the abundance of narcotic substances that are stored there,
 due to its remote mountain location, security is comparatively lax.
 And what substances were stolen?
 WellΓÇª Because of their thorough control of the substances,
 they were able to determine immediately which substances were takenΓÇª
 So the description matched after all, huhΓÇª
 But even if a mere Chunin were to remove those narcotic substances
 what would he be able to do with them?
 OhΓÇª Thank you. You may go nowΓÇª
 Yes maΓÇÖam!
 In any case, I canΓÇÖt take any chancesΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing I can do if I donΓÇÖt know what his objective is.
 If I canΓÇÖt discern that from the actual materialsΓÇª
 there may still be some meansΓÇª
 Perhaps the proportions of the formula,
 or possibly the order in which theyΓÇÖre blendedΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake that itΓÇÖs this direction, right?
 YesΓÇª Please continue to proceed just like this.
 Tsubaki, you said ΓÇ£It will all be too late.ΓÇ¥
 But do you know what his objective is?
 ProbablyΓÇª Although maybe not totally.
 Tsubaki, please tell us!
 In the past, he told meΓÇª
 ""I will get my hands on OrochimaruΓÇÖs power and go to where Orochimaru is.""
 What was that?!
 The reason he stole the Scroll of Sealing
 was simply because he had chosen it as a hospitality giftΓÇª
 TsubakiΓÇª You knew that?
 I didnΓÇÖt convey it to the villageΓÇª
 Just removing the Scroll of Sealing is a serious felonyΓÇª
 And moreover, I was scared for whatΓÇÖd happen
 if his real objective had come to lightΓÇª
 I believed that he would mend his ways.
 In that case you cannot avoid retribution either.
 I am prepared for it.
 I thought it was strangeΓÇª
 If you knew where Mizuki was going,
 you should have pursued him alone in the first place.
 But youΓÇª
 I may not be able to stop him aloneΓÇª
 I want to stop him at any costΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt want him to commit any more crimes.
 Unbelievable!
 That OrochimaruΓÇª So this was his plan!
 However, could an ordinary Ninja really manage to do thisΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs something only within
 the realm of an experienced artisanΓÇÖs techniqueΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm busy!
 I have a progress report on the inmate prison break incident!
 All rightΓÇª Enter!
 Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 We have just finished recapturing all inmates
 with the exception of three ΓÇô Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin.
 Good workΓÇª
 We are now continuing to investigate the other threeΓÇª
 But, the last inmate we captured said something that concerned meΓÇª
 Something that concerned you?
 YesΓÇª He apparently saw the three of them fleeing togetherΓÇª
 Fujin and Raijin were fleeing with Mizuki?!
 Damn it!
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm going out!
 Where are you going?
 ThereΓÇÖs no need for you to comeΓÇª
 If what he said is true,
 the guys I sent out wonΓÇÖt be able to deal with the situation aloneΓÇª
 Hey, ShikamaruΓÇª lf things continue like thisΓÇª
 weΓÇÖll be in trouble!
 WeΓÇÖre already in troubleΓÇª
 ShikamaruΓÇª All the Chakra isΓÇª
 I know thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve thought of several methods,
 but if I let go of these guys we are gonna find ourselves in troubleΓÇª
 You insolent jerk!
 Having said that,
 I canΓÇÖt take them down simply by catching them,
 so thatΓÇÖs why IΓÇÖm doing thisΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt let you leave here alive!
 These guys have monstrous staminaΓÇª
 And whatΓÇÖs more,
 although their bodies look like rubber at first glance,
 with that much muscle strength their instantaneous reflexes
 are probably quite something tooΓÇª
 In other words,
 youΓÇÖre saying that this is the only possible methodΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs do our best, everyone!
 Sorry about thisΓÇª
 What do you think, Mizuki?
 ItΓÇÖs no goodΓÇª ltΓÇÖs unfortunate but, he can no longerΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª All right! LetΓÇÖs withdraw!
 Hurry up!
 YeahΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunate butΓÇª
 guys who are of no use on the battleground
 only become a ball and chainΓÇª
 Even though itΓÇÖs just a minor injury,
 you wonΓÇÖt be able to move from this place, can you?
 WhoΓÇÖs that?!
 Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?!
 I saw thatΓÇª
 No wayΓÇª This canΓÇÖt be, youΓÇÖreΓÇª
 Orochimaru?!
 You are correctΓÇª
 This canΓÇÖt beΓÇª Why are you here?
 Your whereabouts are supposed to be unknown!
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter whyΓÇª
 More importantly,
 I witnessed something very interesting earlier onΓÇª
 You took the life of an injured comrade, didnΓÇÖt you?
 You saw thatΓÇª?
 That piqued my interestΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not a sight one sees very often among the Leaf Shinobi
 who devote their entire time to playing house in the villageΓÇª
 So what are you trying to say?!
 I didnΓÇÖt do anything wrong! I had no choice but to do what I did!
 YouΓÇÖre a short-tempered child, arenΓÇÖt youΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm not reproaching you. You were just carrying out your mission.
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 ButΓÇª Is there anybody in the Leaf Village who acknowledges you?
 What did you just do?!
 What in the world is thisΓÇª?
 This is my present to youΓÇª
 Go visit that place if you feel like it.
 Here it isΓÇª
 Looks like there hasnΓÇÖt been a trespasser here before meΓÇª
 The eighth one on the rightΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs happening?
 What is that power of OrochimaruΓÇÖs anyway?
 I donΓÇÖt know either.
 And I donΓÇÖt know when he encountered Orochimaru eitherΓÇª
 But IΓÇÖm positive that the answer to those questions is waiting just up ahead!
 That Scroll of Sealing incidentΓÇª
 You must be angry about it, arenΓÇÖt you, Naruto?
 I donΓÇÖt care about that in the least anymoreΓÇª
 Because I repaid my debt to that jerk Mizuki right there and then.
 ButΓÇª
 But?
 If that guy is still connected to Orochimaru,
 I need to ask him about something!
 Because thereΓÇÖs someone I need to find at any cost!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs up thereΓÇª
 All right!
 ThatΓÇÖs everythingΓÇª
 With this allΓÇª
 This will ΓÇª
 This will make me perfect!
 This place isΓÇª
 That guy has done somethingΓÇª
 That smell gives me the shiversΓÇª
 Smell?
 I was wondering who that wasΓÇª
 You guys are really persistent, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Well, this is very convenient.
 Because I was intending to take you guys down anyway.
 MizukiΓÇª
 You jerk!
 MizukiΓÇª Your ambitions end here!
 Impudent as always, huhΓÇª However, youΓÇÖre too late!
 Just like you always areΓÇª
 What is that?
 Beautiful, donΓÇÖt you think?
 Damn it!
 You guysΓÇªshould feel honored to be my first preyΓÇª
 What?!
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªalmost likeΓÇª
 But thatΓÇÖs they way it is, isnΓÇÖt it, NarutoΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs true, you were actually special.
 ButΓÇª
 Then thatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs power!
 MizukiΓÇª
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 ThatΓÇÖs what you meant by the ΓÇ£invincible bodyΓÇ¥?
 No matter how much strength you gain,
 the kind of strength dependant on drugs can never be a true strength!
 Hah! Just like Iruka Sensei says! OrochimaruΓÇÖs Drug?
 IΓÇÖll crush that kind of nonsense, so be prepared!

112,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Byakugan!
 Caught ΓÇÖem!
 All right! All right! IΓÇÖll drag Sasuke back without fail!
 Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
 but IΓÇÖm gonna demonstrate my new Jutsu right here!
 Me, too!
 DonΓÇÖt be so hasty.
 As soon as preparations have been made to implement my strategyΓÇª
 weΓÇÖll make direct contact with the target!
 It looks like they havenΓÇÖt noticed us yet.
 Huh? Sasuke isnΓÇÖt there.
 It appears thatΓÇª
 heΓÇÖs inside that ΓÇ£coffin.ΓÇ¥
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 I poked the bush for kicks
 and out comes not even a snake, but just two bugs.
 Hey, wait a minute! Wait!
 We didnΓÇÖt come here to fight.
 We just came here to negotiate!
 Huh, thenΓÇª
 What are they?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no point to that Smoke Bomb.
 You canΓÇÖt run away from me.
 ItΓÇÖs string that's thinner and stronger than wire that you can hardly see.
 My string is placed all over this place.
 Darn.
 Those two types of wires on the trap were on purposeΓÇª
 It was actually a triple trap.
 Darn.
 DidnΓÇÖt think they had one with such ability in the groupΓÇª
 You will beΓÇª!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on...? My bodyΓÇª
 Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
 ButΓÇª There is one with ability like this, too.
 Thanks for getting caught so nicely in my strategy.
 DarnΓÇª But...
 I have this kind of ability, too.
 Where did it come from?
 Earth Style Barrier!
 Earth Dome Prison!
 Squad Mutiny: Everything Falls Apart!
 Darn!
 Where is this?
 Inside of that big guyΓÇÖs barrier.
 Darn!
 These guys are mine. I want to recover as much as possible.
 Once youΓÇÖre done eating, catch up with us,
 weΓÇÖre going ahead.
 Come quickly.
 Let us out! You!
 Be quiet, Naruto!
 From the looks of it, it just looks like a dirt wallΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs their Jutsu, there must be some kind of trap.
 I donΓÇÖt know what itΓÇÖs made of,
 but weΓÇÖre just going to have to tear this wall down!
 Even though itΓÇÖs dangerous to be careless,
 actually itΓÇÖs more dangerous to remain silent here.
 Tunneling Fang!
 The wall is restoring itselfΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª
 I saw that.
 Let us out!
 ItΓÇÖs not just a dirt wall, after all.
 Byakugan!
 Th-This isΓÇª
 What is it ? WhatΓÇÖs happening?
 This is bad. ChakraΓÇÖs getting sucked upΓÇª
 DarnΓÇª I didnΓÇÖt expect that they would just keep us in the barrier,
 but I didnΓÇÖt predict that they would suck our Chakra either.
 Man. How dare they! Let us out of here already!
 IΓÇÖve had a good amount of Chakra. Thank you for the meal.
 I feel like my body energy is being sucked out.
 It wonΓÇÖt be good if we stay like this here, Shikamaru.
 It was careless to get caught
 before we even figured out our enemyΓÇÖs powers.
 On top of all thatΓÇªinside here.
 Darn! IΓÇÖm going to make an air hole before all my Chakra is gone!
 Akamaru!
 The Food Pills!
 Akamaru! Human Mimicry Ninja Art!
 And for me, Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!
 Fang Over Fang!
 All right! Good going, Kiba.
 ItΓÇÖs uselessΓÇª
 Darn! It starts to restore the moment itΓÇÖs hit.
 Same with the ground.
 At this rate, we wonΓÇÖt be able to keep up for another ten minutes.
 WeΓÇÖll lose all our Chakra and be totally annihilatedΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt use the Rasengan that requires extremely difficult Chakra control
 especially in a place like this that sucks the Chakra out of us.
 Darn!
 Hey, I want you to listen to me! I want to talk to your leader.
 We wonΓÇÖt go after Sasuke anymore, so let us out of here!
 HeyΓÇª
 Shikamaru, what are you saying?
 Pleading for your life, how interestingΓÇª
 But you guys are my prey, I canΓÇÖt let you out.
 ThenΓÇªjust let me out on my own.
 This battleΓÇª
 is such a pain.
 You! Do you know what youΓÇÖre saying?
 Shut up, Kiba, be quietΓÇª
 What?!
 A split in the group, huh?
 Seems like youΓÇÖre the leader, butΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt think you would be the only one begging for your life!
 You really see a humanΓÇÖs true nature when one is pushed to the edge of death.
 YouΓÇÖre such a low-life creature,
 youΓÇÖre not qualified to be responsible for the lives of your platoon members.
 IΓÇÖve saved the most important thing for lastΓÇª
 To abandon Sasuke and to even sell out on your own platoonΓÇª
 Is that what it means to be a Chunin of the Leaf?
 Sasuke is a Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 He is a comrade!
 Therefore, I will put my life on the line to help him!
 That's the way of the Leaf Village.
 Someone like you deserves to dieΓÇª I wonΓÇÖt let you out.
 Shikamaru! I believed in you, but now IΓÇÖve lost confidence in you!
 LetΓÇÖs take this outside!
 Hey, we canΓÇÖt get out! You fool!
 ThatΓÇÖs why weΓÇÖre in this situation!
 What do you mean by ""fool""?
 IΓÇÖm just speaking the truth, fool!
 Oh! You said ""fool"" again!
 Everybody, be quiet for a second!
 Choji?
 Now heΓÇÖs squatting down. What is he thinking?
 Hey! Why are you eating snacks all of a sudden?!
 Choji binge eats when he gets upsetΓÇª
 Geez, another useless guy.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped! ln this case, Shadow CloneΓÇª!
 Stop it.
 The enemyΓÇÖs Chakra is placed all over that wall.
 Even if you are able to scratch it, the wall will restore itself right away.
 In other words, itΓÇÖs useless unless we can attack it
 with a Taijutsu that has enough power to destroy this wall with one blow.
 Somebody that has a Taijutsu with greater destructive power than mine
 would be Choji, butΓÇª
 At this rateΓÇª
 Darn, what do we do!
 NejiΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorry, but can you use the rest of the Chakra you have
 to observe the wall behind you and the wall behind Choji?
 I got it.
 Shikamaru! You be quiet!
 Naruto!
 You still donΓÇÖt understand?!
 Remember what Shikamaru said when he gathered everyone!
 Even I can't just sit back and be a sluggard.
 Because I'm responsible for your lives.
 Choji, donΓÇÖt raise your voice too much from here.
 Kiba, dent that wall behind Neji and Choji again!
 Y-YeahΓÇª
 Huh! I donΓÇÖt fully understand whatΓÇÖs going on,
 but IΓÇÖll go wild one more time!
 Tunneling Fang!
 Huh! No matter how hard you try, itΓÇÖs useless!
 Huh, I seeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs over there.
 Neji!
 Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife.
 Choji, are you ready?!
 Okay! Any time!
 All right, letΓÇÖs do this.
 WhatΓÇÖs happening?!
 Like I said earlier, the wallΓÇÖs surface is planted with Chakra.
 But even this tough wall could have an area that have a thin layer of Chakra.
 That is what Shikamaru speculated.
 HowΓÇªHow did you get all of that?
 Think about what happened earlier.
 Because he noticed that there were areas that restored quickly
 and others that didnΓÇÖt so quickly
 when Kiba and Akamaru attacked the wall surface.
 In other words, he guessed that those areas that didnΓÇÖt restore quickly
 probably has a thin layer of Chakra.
 On top of all that, by cleverly talking to the enemy,
 he figured out the position of the enemy outside of the wall.
 He guessed that the wall furthest from the enemy
 probably had the thinnest point of Chakra,
 so thatΓÇÖs what he wanted to confirm.
 ThatΓÇÖs what it is, correct?
 I see, in order to trick the enemy, you must trick your friends first.
 I didnΓÇÖt see that there was such a plan behind that conversation.
 Then, Choji realized the plan
 and the reason why he was eating was to replenish his Chakra.
 These twoΓÇª
 They havenΓÇÖt been working together as a team all these years for nothing.
 IΓÇÖm depending on you, Choji.
 Yeah!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 All right, letΓÇÖs go!
 Human Boulder!
 What?!
 ChojiΓÇª You are awesome, after all!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake LetΓÇÖs look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden, Choji!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way thatΓÇÖs possible!
 But, Choji is right.
 If we keep lagging, we wonΓÇÖt be able to catch up with Sasuke.
 But stillΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt worry. I have an idea.
 Choji, are you possibly thinkingΓÇª
 Do you have a plan or something?
 Yeah.
 Hey! Choji!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! I have that secret weapon of mine!
 Next time: ΓÇ£Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!ΓÇ¥

 This is the spot you all will be setting out forΓÇª
 Great Stone Face of Warudakumi on the summit of Mount Takurami.
 The team leader will not take routes other than the ones indicated on the mapΓÇª
 in order to ensure the safety of the Academy students.
 Along the way, there will be obstacles such as instructors disguised as enemy Ninja,
 as well as trap and the like.
 But you Academy students should be able to safely evade them

 YouΓÇÖll see the Stone Face of Warudakumi
 after you cover about eighty kilometers.

 will have completed the training upon crossing the finish line.
 There is only one secret document.

 In particular, if you donΓÇÖt acutely sense the weatherr,
 it could end up being fatal, so be careful.
 ΓÇô Okay! 					ΓÇô Okay!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Moegi? Pull it properly, believe it!
 IΓÇÖve had it! I donΓÇÖt want to do this!
 Moegi! Stop saying selfish things and hold it!
 ButΓÇª
 What, really?!
 It seems itΓÇÖs going to directly hit the Leaf Village before dawnΓÇª
 Jeez, why nowΓÇª?!
 The communication from the observatory
 was probably delayed due to the storm.
 We have no choice, thenΓÇª
 The training is suspended.
 Convey the order to all the teams immediately!
 ΓÇô Yes, sir! 					ΓÇô Yes, sir!
 WhyΓÇÖd you put the tent away?!
 Brother Naruto, whatΓÇÖs the deal?
 This path isnΓÇÖt on the map.
 We fell behind the others more than I thought.
 We canΓÇÖt be resting
 Then, this pathΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª ItΓÇÖs not on the map. ltΓÇÖs a shortcut route!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 Will this be okay?!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing?! WeΓÇÖll be late if we donΓÇÖt hurry!
 DonΓÇÖt talk nonsense!
 We havenΓÇÖt learned that method of climbing!
 Right! Chakra control comes after weΓÇÖve become senior students!
 That makes no difference. You can do anything if you get serious!
 Come on! LetΓÇÖs go!
 Damn itΓÇª!
 Grab on!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖre you doing?!
 Oh! Let go, Konohamaru!
 If I let go, heΓÇÖll blow away!
 Let go of the bag, Udon!
 I-I canΓÇÖtΓÇª!
 It canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 No! I canΓÇÖt hold on any longer!
 That was a close one!
 I issued an evacuation advisory
 to all the teams encamped at the foot of the mountain.
 I seeΓÇª Now all thatΓÇÖs left is NarutoΓÇÖs teamΓÇª
 Iruka Sensei!
 I found this on an unplanned routeΓÇª
 An unplanned route, you say?!
 What do we do now? WeΓÇÖve lost our tent and our foodΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no point in saying that!
 What?! ItΓÇÖs because you put your foot on my backpack in the first placeΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?!
 If my foot hadnΓÇÖt gotten caught, we wouldΓÇÖve blown away.
 Now, nowΓÇª Stop fighting, believe it.
 Why didnΓÇÖt you close the zipper, Udon?!
 SorryΓÇª
 Now, nowΓÇª DonΓÇÖt say that, Konohamaru!
 When you get right down to it,
 itΓÇÖs your fault for entering a strange route, Brother Naruto!
 Right, right!
 What?
 We got behind because
 you got caught in a trap and were lost forever!
 Hey, what did you say?!
 You canΓÇÖt justify yourself, can you?!
 We couldΓÇÖve gotten through faster if you guys hadnΓÇÖt gotten in the way!
 ItΓÇÖs because our leaderΓÇÖs not dependable!
 What?!
 Heh! How silly!
 ΓÇô What did you say?! ΓÇô What did you say?!
 What?!
 OhhΓÇª IΓÇÖm hungryΓÇª Temporary ceasefire.
 This is the spot.
 That NarutoΓÇª
 After all I told him about following instructions!
 Taking the direction of the wind under consideration,
 theyΓÇÖre above here, I guessΓÇª
 Okay, letΓÇÖs go, Shikamaru.
 Right.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 ItΓÇÖs all stuff we need hot water forΓÇª
 About the only thing we can eat is the baumkuchen cakeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm hungryΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre asking too much!
 This is survival,
 so itΓÇÖs common sense to have things ready that can be eaten right away!
 Right, right!
 I wonΓÇÖt share if youΓÇÖre going to complain!
 IΓÇÖm taking the big one.
 The biggest oneΓÇªis mine!
 The big oneΓÇª The big oneΓÇª
 Okay, eat up!
 WhatΓÇª? ButΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs divided in three?
 YouΓÇÖre not having any here, Brother Naruto?
 Back in the day,
 I also went without food once when I screwed up during training.
 We couldnΓÇÖt all pull together and Kakashi Sensei got mad at usΓÇª
 Cripes! Who cares about three working as one?!
 It's called teamwork.
 I figured it out at that time.
 The important thing for a Ninja isnΓÇÖt rules or codes,
 but teamwork acting for the sake of comradesΓÇª
 Here.
 SakuraΓÇª
 Brother NarutoΓÇª
 Well as for me, I donΓÇÖt like sweets, so!
 ΓÇô OhΓÇª 					ΓÇô OhΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre one to talk having bought it yourself!
 Your stomach growled.
 You have some too, Brother Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs pretty slippery. You okay, Shikamaru?
 YeahΓÇª
 Damn itΓÇª How could that Naruto take such a dangerous route?!
 JeezΓÇª HeΓÇÖs always causing some kind of trouble.
 What a pain he isΓÇª
 It seems they were here until just a little while agoΓÇª
 He really does causeΓÇªtrouble.
 The finish line is right before our eyes!
 That method of climbing isnΓÇÖt fair, I tell you!
 Right! I knew we shouldnΓÇÖt have shared the food!
 What is it, Udon?
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing? WeΓÇÖll leave you behind!
 SomethingΓÇÖsΓÇªcomingΓÇª
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 R-Run while you can!
 G-Got it!
 H-Hurry it upΓÇª
 Brother Naruto!
 ΓÇô Brother Naruto! ΓÇô Brother Naruto!
 Brother! Brother Naruto! Hang in there!
 What should we do, Konohamaru?!
 WeΓÇÖll go help himΓÇª
 ButΓÇªit looks like it'll crumble again!
 Brother Naruto! LetΓÇÖs go, Udon, Moegi!
 Are you awake, Brother Naruto?!
 That was close. So I made it into a space between the rocks, huhΓÇª?
 WeΓÇÖre coming to help!
 Idiot! Run, quick!
 KonohamaruΓÇª
 We canΓÇÖt do itΓÇª LetΓÇÖs call for help--
 Brother said it before!
 The important thing for a Ninja is teamwork!
 Konohamaru, youΓÇª
 No! If I move even a little, the support rock will give way
 and you guys will end up getting entangled in this!
 Brother Naruto! Have you forgotten what you yourself said?
 You can do anythingΓÇª
 ΓÇªif you get serious!
 You guysΓÇª
 Konohamaru Gang! Help Brother Naruto!
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 Be careful!
 Easy does it!
 Yeah.
 But hurry.
 It movedΓÇªTime it right and toss it away in one shot.
 Got it!
 One, twoΓÇª!
 Yes!
 ItΓÇÖs a big success!
 We did it, we did it!
 That was a close oneΓÇª
 ΓÇô Naruto! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 You guys okay?
 Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru!
 Naruto! Above you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Run towards Shikamaru!
 ΓÇô Brother Naruto! ΓÇô Brother Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Rasengan!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Man, making us get all nervousΓÇª
 Excellent, Brother NarutoΓÇª
 Thank goodness!
 Yeah!
 So, whatΓÇÖs the meaning of this?
 So you seeΓÇª
 It was all Brother NarutoΓÇÖs orders!
 We were opposed,
 but he forced us to move ahead saying the only way to finish first
 was to take a dangerous shortcut!
 I said many times we shouldnΓÇÖt because itΓÇÖs dangerous!
 ButΓÇª
 ΓÇô Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead! ΓÇô Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
 WhatΓÇª? What?
 It seems thatΓÇÖs about the size of itΓÇª YouΓÇÖre prepared, right, Naruto?
 SayΓÇª
 Since when did your teamwork get so good?
 Naruto!
 IΓÇÖve had it with lectures!
 Hey, wait! Naruto!
 Wait!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you

 Big Brother Omasa, weΓÇÖre missing one!
 What? Who is it?!
 ItΓÇÖs Idate! Morino Idate!
 Darn, he's such a hopeless kid!
 What should we do? Shall we wait?
 We have no choiceΓÇª
 What the--?!
 Who is it?!
 You people are from the Wasabi Family of the Land of Tea, correct?
 Who are you!
 You should know your place.
 Hooligans like you people are no match for a Shinobi!
 Please donΓÇÖt worry. I wonΓÇÖt take your lives.
 If youΓÇÖve learned from this,
 you should give up the race at Todoroki Great Shrine.
 Blast it!
 I have to at least deliver this letter to the Hidden Leaf Village.
 OK! Mission! Mission! IΓÇÖm so eager to do it!
 But Kakashi Sensei is not here.
 Is he late as usual?
 No, Kakashi will not be coming.
 It's Old Lady Tsunade!
 DonΓÇÖt call me an old lady!
 Excuse meΓÇª Lady HokageΓÇª
 What do you mean by Kakashi Sensei will not be coming?
 As you three already know,
 most of the Jonin including Kakashi are on different missions.
 This time, the three of you will have to execute the mission by yourselves.
 This is a B-rank mission, escorting an important figure!
 Escorting an important figureΓÇª
 Of course, depending on the situation,
 the mission has the possibility of becoming an A-rank.
 And, who are we protecting?
 DonΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 What do you mean ΓÇ£donΓÇÖt knowΓÇ¥?!
 In the neighboring nation of the Land of Tea,
 they have a Dedication Ceremony at the Todoroki Great Shrine
 once every four years.
 WeΓÇÖve received a request to escort the runner
 who will be participating in the race that will be held there.
 But an assailant from the opponentΓÇÖs side
 attacked the messengers before they arrived here.
 Assailant?
 Excuse me, but I still donΓÇÖt quite understand the mission.
 Well, you should get the details directly from Boss Jirocho.
 Boss Jirocho?! Oh yeah! The boss from that time!
 ThatΓÇÖs it.
 Now that you three understand, depart immediately!
 Get to the Land of Tea by today. Snap to it!
 ΓÇô Yes! 					ΓÇô All right.
 Okay!
 Roger that!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you.
 Mission! Help an Old Friend in the Land of Tea
 Hey Sakura, arenΓÇÖt you hungry?
 Well, a little bitΓÇª
 Then itΓÇÖs decided!
 And perfect timing! ThereΓÇÖs a teahouse right over there!
 Hey, Naruto.
 YouΓÇÖre hereΓÇª?
 Aoi Rokusho has now arrived.
 I had you go through all that trouble,
 but Jirocho of the Wasabi does not know when to give up.
 Is he still trying to take part in the race at Todoroki Great Shrine?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 And thereΓÇÖs new information that they have also hired Shinobi.
 I seeΓÇª
 Then next time, letΓÇÖs beat them to a pulp at the raceΓÇª
 Welcome!
 MaΓÇÖam, IΓÇÖll have sweet bean soup.
 Then IΓÇÖll have dumplings.
 How about you, Sasuke?
 JellyΓÇª
 All right, please wait for a moment.
 Ninja from the LeafΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm gonna work so hard!
 Naruto, donΓÇÖt take unnecessary action by yourself.
 Oh, okay.
 Having sweet bean soup when it's so nice outside.
 The Ninja profession sure is carefree!
 What did you say?
 Things must really be peaceful for the Leaf Village.
 Such a dense-looking bunch of guysΓÇª
 What?!
 Hey! I didnΓÇÖt know there was such a cutie here.
 I take back that previous comment!
 AhΓÇªpardon me.
 I'm Idate Morino.
 WhatΓÇÖs your name, young lady?
 DonΓÇÖt you talk to Sakura in such a familiar tone!
 SakuraΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs a good name.
 Hey, even a chance meeting is due to karma from a previous life.
 Why donΓÇÖt we talk about our future?
 Huh? Talk aboutΓÇªthe future?
 IΓÇÖm talking about you quitting the Ninja life and becoming my brideΓÇª
 Hey you! How dare you hit on her all of a sudden!
 DonΓÇÖt be silly!
 Just joking.
 But hey, you fool!
 Idate here hates Ninja!
 If you wander around the Land of Tea anymore,
 thereΓÇÖll be a price to pay!
 ThatΓÇÖs amusing! Bring it on!
 Hey, Naruto!
 Ridiculous! We donΓÇÖt have time to waste on a hooligan.
 Be quiet, Sasuke!
 IΓÇÖm not going to forgive a guy who makes fun of Shinobi!
 IΓÇÖm going to punish this guyΓÇª
 Huh?
 HeΓÇÖs goneΓÇª
 Impossible! I didnΓÇÖt even noticeΓÇª
 Where did that guy run away to?!
 Here, thank you for waiting.
 Dang it!
 Thank you for your patronage.
 What? Two bills?
 This isΓÇª?
 Oh, that kid who was here left, saying that you guys would pay.
 That guy! How dare he make fools of us!
 The sound of footsteps is far offΓÇª He has considerable speed!
 He made us look like idiots!
 I canΓÇÖt stay quiet. We have to chase him!
 Missus, thank you very much. IΓÇÖll leave the money here.
 Thanks!
 All the customers today seem to be in such a hurry.
 He has incredible speed. He must have trained very hard.
 Who is he?
 DoesnΓÇÖt matter, weΓÇÖre definitely going to catch up to him!
 Stupid Ninja!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way they can catch up to me!
 Owww!
 Darn itΓÇª Swift Runner Idate makes a mistake of a lifetime!
 Serves you right!
 You have some nerve, trying to run away from us.
 IΓÇÖm so sorry!
 Huh?
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss, then you guys showed up.
 So I did thatΓÇª
 You kinda feel sorry after hearing his story.
 Then you should have said that from the start!
 Ow! HuhΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 DonΓÇÖt touch it!
 This is mine!
 Wh-What theΓÇª?!
 On your mark.
 Get setΓÇª
 Go!
 Weights?
 Try to catch me now, you idiots!
 Hey! He escaped again!
 That guy!
 He simply doesnΓÇÖt get it!
 Is he for real?
 What a speedΓÇª!
 No way! Even we canΓÇÖt catch up to himΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs it. We don't have a chance of catching up.
 Dang it! He'll get it when I see him next time!
 All of you, thanks for coming.
 Begging your pardon! Begging your pardon!
 I was born and raised in the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
 I was bathed in birth water at ΓÇ£Ichiraku Ramen.ΓÇ¥
 My given name is Naruto and the surname is Uzumaki.
 People call me--
 Loser!
 LoserΓÇª? Nah, not that!
 YouΓÇÖre funny as usual.
 Boss Jirocho, you're looking good yourself.
 Hey, Naruto!
 That's okay. A boy should be this spunky.
 The greetings seem to be done, so IΓÇÖll get to the main topic.
 The Fifth Hokage told us to get the details of this mission from you.
 Yes, in factΓÇª
 Do you know of the Dedication Ceremony at the Todoroki Great Shrine?
 ToΓÇªTodoΓÇªwhat?
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 The legend goesΓÇª
 A long time ago, in order to subdue a storm,
 RyukoΓÇÖs Jewels were dedicated to the Todoroki Great Shrine
 and the storm subsided.
 It became a customary event that happens once every four years.
 At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels, but several decades ago,
 it became a festival in which the first-place runner
 became the man of the year.
 In recent years, the festival has taken on another face.
 For ages now, in this port town of Degarashi,
 two families, the Wasabi and the Wagarashi,
 have controlled local operations and policed the town.
 ItΓÇÖs embarrassing,
 but conflict between the two families has never ceased and
 there have been numerous skirmishes over territorial rights.
 As the struggle intensified,
 the town residents became entangled and even got injuredΓÇª
 In order to put a stop to the conflict, for the first time,
 there was talk of some kind of mediation in the presence of the lord.
 And it was agreed that the power holder of the town
 would be determined in a contest rather than through brawls.
 So that contest isΓÇª
 It is the Todoroki Great Shrine Dedication Ceremony
 that is held every four years.
 Four years ago, the Wagarashi easily won by hiring a Shinobi,
 and we have learned that they've hired a Shinobi again this year.
 In order to counteract that,
 we sent messengers to the Hidden Leaf Village with a request,
 but they were ambushed and attacked.
 I beg you guys!
 Please lend us your power.
 We cannot afford to lose this race to the Wagarashi Family!
 Leave it to me!
 And, who do you want us to escort?
 Oh, so youΓÇÖll take this job?
 Did you call for me, Boss?
 Oh, you guys know each other? Then that makes the story fast.
 That might not actually be the caseΓÇª
 Boss Jirocho is an important person!
 By rights, he shouldnΓÇÖt bow his head to Ninja like you!
 Even if he did bow his head, IΓÇÖd flatly refuse to escort a guy like you.
 Oh yeah?!
 As if IΓÇÖd go with some guy who came from who-knows-where!
 ""Some guy from who-knows-where""?!
 I am the brilliant Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki,
 who will eventually inherit the name of Hokage!
 Hah! Hokage is no big deal!
 Hah! The boss of hooligans is even less of a big deal!
 You idiot! Boss Jirocho is a very honorable person!
 The Hokage is a great Shinobi
 who puts his life on the line to protect the village!
 Boss Jirocho is a very, very, very honorable person
 who always puts his life on the line to protect the town!
 Hokage is more, more, more incredible!
 Even though itΓÇÖs a tourist resort, everything seems so expensive.
 Sorry about that. lt sure is expensive, isn't it?
 Oh no, I didnΓÇÖt meanΓÇª
 We actually donΓÇÖt want to sell at this kind of price,
 but after the Wagarashi family came into powerΓÇª
 P-Please forgive me!
 How dare you?!
 Do you know who you have to thank to do business?
 Are you actually thinking about turning against the Wagarashi Family?
 N-Not at all. But I have to get paidΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre slow to understand.
 ΓÇô Hey! 					ΓÇô Yes, sir!
 P-Please stop!
 Huh! First of all, weΓÇÖll destroy youΓÇª
 Wh-Who are you?!
 Get out of here before you get hurt!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 Please run away!
 These people are from the WagarashiΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be fine.
 ΓÇô You punk! 					ΓÇô Wise guy!
 WeΓÇÖll let you go for today!
 If youΓÇÖve learned your lesson, never defy us again, kid!
 Or youΓÇÖll pay when we see you next time!
 ΓÇô Y-You wonΓÇÖt get away with this! ΓÇô Y-You wonΓÇÖt get away with this!
 Young manΓÇª
 Thank you very much.
 What a refreshing feeling!
 We definitely need Boss Jirocho's Wasabi Family to win the upcoming race.
 SasukeΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª
 BossΓÇª
 Of all people, did you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi?
 DonΓÇÖt sulk like that, Idate.
 I'm not sulking.
 ItΓÇÖs just thatΓÇª
 IdateΓÇª
 I believe in you more than anybody else.
 The rest depends on you.
 Why donΓÇÖt you believe in people a little?
 IdateΓÇª
 please run for this town.
 I beg you!
 BossΓÇª
 Okay.
 Even in exchange for my lifeΓÇª
 Wow, I didnΓÇÖt think it was going to be this big!
 But what kind of race is it?
 IΓÇÖll explain the course so a dummy like you can understand.
 The starting point is Degarashi Port.
 After the start, you head for Modoroki Shrine which is the midway point.
 This is Modoroki ShrineΓÇª?
 YesΓÇª It seems the fastest way to get to Modoroki Shrine
 is to use a boat from here.
 Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewels from Modoroki Shrine and
 dedicate that jewel at the Todoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu Island.
 That's the only rule for the race.
 So shortcuts, obstructions, and secret maneuvers are all allowed.
 So hiring a Ninja is not a violation of the rule either.
 Who are the Ninja that the other side hired?
 TheyΓÇÖre hiding somewhere and checking the situation.
 DonΓÇÖt be careless, Naruto!
 R-Right!
 You guys can just relax and watch. DonΓÇÖt follow me around!
 What?!
 IΓÇÖm saying I donΓÇÖt want an impediment.
 You!
 Calm down. LetΓÇÖs join forces here.
 ΓÇô Not with a guy like this! ΓÇô Not with a guy like this!
 They seem to strangely be in harmony, these two.
 All right, everybody!
 The Todoroki Great Shrine Race will start soon!
 Wasabi Family's runner, ldate Morino!
 IdateΓÇªMorino?
 Wagarashi FamilyΓÇÖs runner, Fukusuke Hikyakuya!
 On your mark!
 Start!
 All right! WeΓÇÖre going too!
 Wh-What the--?!
 Is he running away?!
 Where are you going, Idate?!
 Hey, wait!
 Wh-What is he doingΓÇª?
 Wait!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 What the heck is he thinking?! That idiot!
 So fast. He's moving at an incredible speed.
 Darn it! The opponent's already far out at sea!
 This is bad!
 If the distance between them gets any greater, it'll be impossible to win!
 That idiot!
 ΓÇô Kick it up a notch, Sakura! ΓÇô Right!
 We're gonna bring him back at all cost and make up the difference!
 Next time: ""The Race is On! Trouble on the High Seas!""
 Don't miss it!

 OwwΓÇª
 Listen up.
 ThereΓÇÖs a chief in this village called the ΓÇ£Hokage.ΓÇ¥
 So thereΓÇÖs no doubt classified information is concentrated where that person is.
 I see.
 If I remember correctly,
 that personΓÇÖs in a building easy to spot with a ΓÇ£FireΓÇ¥ mark on it or somethingΓÇª

 No. I-ItΓÇÖs your imagination!

 Oh, thereΓÇÖs a kite up there flying while eating a pork cutlet rice bowl!
 What? Where, where?
 What? ThereΓÇÖs no kite anywhere.
 Hey, what?
 Jeez, that Ninja has to go and stand behind us
 without any sign of his presence.
 But it seems we fooled him good.
 Our Disguise Jutsu is perfect, sure enough.
 Say, infiltration is kind of easy, isnΓÇÖt it?!
 The Leaf isnΓÇÖt worth fearing!
 Guy and Lee imposters are prowling around the village?
 And to think theyΓÇÖd enter the village in disguises
 without even using Transformation Jutsu.
 Are they really Ninja?
 Weird people find their way in when a village grows.
 Well, itΓÇÖs nonsense, but I thought I would at least report it for now.
 Indeed, we canΓÇÖt just leave intruders unchecked.
 Shall we throw them out?
 No, leave them be.
 What?
 It sounds interesting, doesnΓÇÖt it?
 TheyΓÇÖre going to the trouble of calling themselves Ninja of this village.
 ButΓÇª
 We probably donΓÇÖt need to worry.
 ItΓÇÖs unlikely that anyone could be fooled by such obvious imposters.
 Come on, please. Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 Pretty please with sugar on top! Just the one day today would be fine!
 Let me join your training!
 Hey! WhatΓÇÖs with this guy  all of a sudden?
 HeΓÇÖs probably a real acquaintance of theirs, butΓÇª
 Does he think weΓÇÖre going to do training?!
 IΓÇÖll do anything! IΓÇÖve always been interested in Taijutsu.
 I meanΓÇªokay?! ItΓÇÖs okay, right?
 Anyway, letΓÇÖs turn him away!
 Right!
 No. Take a pass.
 What? Why?!
 Because our training is very harsh,  rough and difficult.
 Difficult training, huhΓÇª?
 Ahhh, IΓÇÖm getting even more fired up! Please!
 I wonΓÇÖt get in your way, no matter what! Come on.
 ΓÇô Absolutely not! ΓÇô Absolutely not!
 All right, since itΓÇÖs come to this!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Real body clones?!
 ΓÇô And furthermoreΓÇª ΓÇô And furthermoreΓÇª

 Yes!
 ΓÇô No way. 					ΓÇô No way.
 Brother, whyΓÇÖd you say okay?
 WhatΓÇÖs done is done, so it canΓÇÖt be helped, right?!
 Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee!
 WhatΓÇÖs the deal, you two?
 WeΓÇÖre going to the farm today, right?
 Farm?
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing letting your mind wander?
 The personΓÇÖs waiting. Come on, hurry!
 ΓÇô Huh? OhΓÇª 					ΓÇô H-Hey!
 Hey, wait!
 ΓÇô WhatΓÇª? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 I promised to plant rice for the sake of training?
 Not only that, all of thisΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs totally huge.
 Gee, thanks. ItΓÇÖs a big help, you guys giving me a hand.
 Please donΓÇÖt worry about it.
 They accepted this on their own accord, so. Bye.
 Why is this training?
 I get it!
 Indeed, I will use my body quite a bit if I do this training.
 So I can get in shape while helping out, huh?
 Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 IΓÇÖll do my best!
 WhyΓÇÖs he that motivated?
 Why should we have to do this manual laborΓÇª?
 Damn it. Anyway, letΓÇÖs get this over with!
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 Th-ThatΓÇÖs mean, brother!
 Oh, sorry about that.
 What?
 Poccha?!
 Come to think of it, there are flying leeches  in the rice fields,
 so be careful.
 F-Flying leeches?!
 Worst-case scenario, it could be deadly.
 Yikes.
 Hey Poccha!
 Hang in there!
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect of Taijutsu training!
 That was some intense rice planting!
 Phew, that was a good workout!
 W-WeΓÇÖre doneΓÇª
 Th-That was life or deathΓÇª
 Then, shall we move on?
 ΓÇô A manure receptacle?! ΓÇô A manure receptacle?!
 Spread this in that field over there.
 Th-This is also trainingΓÇª?
 H-HeavyΓÇªSmellyΓÇª
 Why should I have to do something like thisΓÇª?
 Hey, you guys, why donΓÇÖt you walk straight?
 Y-You can walk twice the forward progress distance
 if you move ahead while  walking left and right like this!
 Oh, so that was it?
 Then IΓÇÖll alsoΓÇª
 Like this?
 I-ItΓÇÖs really hard to balance like this!
 D-Damn it!
 Gee, I didnΓÇÖt realize at all that there was a method of training like thisΓÇª
 Hey! Watch it. Walk more over thereΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖd you say?
 What a nightmare.
 Forget about it. Anyway, letΓÇÖs lose the kid right now.
 As for you guys, you still kind of smell bad.
 ΓÇô Shut up! 					ΓÇô Shut up!
 There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee.
 Oh, Sakura.
 Oh, Naruto. YouΓÇÖre here, too?
 As for me, IΓÇÖm training together with these two today.
 R-Really?
 More importantly, is something up?
 YeahΓÇª Actually, I really wanted your help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee.
 ΓÇô What? 					ΓÇô What?
 ΓÇô Your laundry blew away in the wind? ΓÇô Your laundry blew away in the wind?
 ThatΓÇÖs right. lt got caught in a bit of a high spot.
 No. No way, no way. WeΓÇÖve got lots of work to do, so.
 Come on!
 Here IΓÇÖm asking precisely because itΓÇÖs you guys.
 Please donΓÇÖt say no!
 Sakura, if youΓÇÖre in that much trouble, I could get it for you!
 Okay, Guy Sensei?
 Okay?!
 Sure.
 What a sheer cliff.
 ThatΓÇÖs for sure. WeΓÇÖd be beyond help if we were to fall from up there.
 Right? I donΓÇÖt quite have the confidenceΓÇª
 That meansΓÇª
 Yup! ItΓÇÖs right above here.
 Gee, as one would expect, I donΓÇÖt think we couldΓÇª
 IsnΓÇÖt that great, Sakura?
 For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this is no different than a flat path.
 ThatΓÇÖs encouraging.
 ItΓÇÖs a big help having an awesome Ninja like you close by, Guy Sensei.
 What? UhhΓÇª UmmΓÇª
 Now, please.
 BrotherΓÇª
 Damn it. Why is this happening?!
 I-I donΓÇÖt want to die.
 D-Damn it!
 Hey, as for you guys, why arenΓÇÖt you using the Chakra suction?
 Th-This is training for building up muscular strength!
 So thatΓÇÖs what it was?!
 Just what IΓÇÖd expect of a Taijutsu user.
 I never came up with deliberately draining physical strength!
 I really do learn a lot from being with you, Sensei.
 Th-This jerkΓÇª
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªIΓÇÖm going to dieΓÇª
 Alley-oop!
 No!
 Th-That was closeΓÇª!
 Gee, sorry about that.
 This jerkΓÇª
 All right, we made it.
 DonΓÇÖt look down!
 Anyway, if we can just take this back with usΓÇª
 Alley-oopΓÇª
 Damn itΓÇª
 All right, I got it.
 It wonΓÇÖt come looseΓÇª Hey, help me out here.
 R-RightΓÇª
 You littleΓÇª!
 Sensei, use suction with your Chakra!
 This is nothing to me!
 Look out!
 For real? What?!
 Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
 IΓÇÖve had itΓÇª
 Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 That was awesome!
 To do something like not using Chakra suction. Awesome!
 ΓÇô Look youΓÇª! 					ΓÇô Look youΓÇª!
 Perfect timing, you guys.
 Old Lady Tsunade.
 Actually, IΓÇÖve got something I want to ask you guys to do.
 My companion suddenly started not feeling well, you see.
 ΓÇô Yikes! ItΓÇÖs huge! ΓÇô It's huge!
 It seems sheΓÇÖs caught a cold.
 ItΓÇÖs a huge slug. Oh, as for this, is it something like Chief Toad?
 Well, that sounds about right.
 However, as you can see, we canΓÇÖt carelessly move her.
 Sorry, but could you guys look after her for a while?
 IΓÇÖm very sorry.
 Jeez. What a ridiculous guy.
 Brother, at this rate we wonΓÇÖt be able  to look for the confidential information.
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs right.
 Shut up.
 WhatΓÇÖre you moaning about?
 You guys.
 It couldnΓÇÖt be that you guys
 canΓÇÖt listen to the words of me, the Hokage, could it?
 ΓÇô This is the Hokage? ΓÇô This is the Hokage?
 This is bad. To think the Hokage was that fierce a person.
 WeΓÇÖre taking care of her precious companion.
 We might be able to get into the Hokage estate surprisingly easily.
 I wonder.
 So even Summoning animals get sick, tooΓÇª
 It seems to be a light cold.
 My nose itches, I have a sore throat and I feel weak or somethingΓÇª
 Hey, IΓÇÖm going to chill your forehead!
 Thank you so much.
 All right, here we go.
 OhΓÇªOh no. The itchingΓÇª
 What?!
 ΓÇô Wha--! 					ΓÇô What?!
 ItΓÇÖsΓÇª ItΓÇÖs meltingΓÇª
 Watch it, you!
 IΓÇÖm very sorry. IΓÇÖll be more caref--
 Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
 YouΓÇÖll be in danger if you donΓÇÖt move away from there!

 Y-You idiot!
 IΓÇÖm developing my dynamic vision  for narrowly evading danger!
 Wha--?
 That Sensei,
 he was training, putting his life at risk even at times like thisΓÇª?
 Even though that Bushy Brow guyΓÇÖs  training properly, as for meΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖve woken up, Guy Sensei, IΓÇÖll train with you!
 LetΓÇÖs do this!
 Ohh, the joints in my body hurtΓÇª I feel like IΓÇÖm going to fall apartΓÇª
 Hey! Aren't you a slug? WhatΓÇÖre you doing talking about joints?!
 ΓÇô S-Save us. 					ΓÇô S-Save us!
 IΓÇÖve had it. WhatΓÇÖs going on with this villageΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖll die if I stay in a place like this any longer.
 WithdrawΓÇª
 Right.
 WhoΓÇÖre you guys?
 Why are you dressed like my prot├⌐g├⌐ LeeΓÇª?
 Damn it!
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this,  I donΓÇÖt give a damn anymore!
 ΓÇô Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack! ΓÇô Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
 I donΓÇÖt really get it, but it seems  we just have to fight, huh?
 So it seems.
 LetΓÇÖs go, Lee!
 Now, knockout technique!
 ΓÇô Double Dynamic Entry! ΓÇô Double Dynamic Entry!
 Damn it. What did we go there for  in the end?!
 I really hate, I really hateΓÇª
 ΓÇô the likes of the Leaf! ΓÇô the likes of the Leaf!
 Tamaya!
 Lord knows where they came from,
 but now theyΓÇÖll probably never  want to try that again.
 You sure looked like you were having fun, Lady Tsunade,
 going so far as to summon Katsuyu.
 Well, my adorable Genin helped out as well, so.
 Now, weΓÇÖve had our breather. So please be getting back to work.
 Oh yes, maΓÇÖam.
 But stillΓÇª What was with that Naruto?
 To think he seriously believed those two were for real.
 What was that all about?
 Who knowsΓÇª?
 Hey!
 Naruto.
 ΓÇô Someone who looked just like me nowΓÇª ΓÇô Man, you guys got separated.
 I didnΓÇÖt know what to do.
 As for me, I was impressed!
 ΓÇô You guys were really cool earlier! ΓÇô Huh?
 IΓÇÖve learned of the intricacies of Taijutsu or somethingΓÇª
 A lot happened, but IΓÇÖll continue training right away!
 Continue training?
 So come on, letΓÇÖs continue the Taijutsu training!
 Moron, moron, moron.
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Damn it! Why should a Ninja have to do something like get rid of a ghost?!
 We have no choice, right? After all, a commission is a comission!
 The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?! Th-ThatΓÇÖs ridiculous!
 But they say it comes out at night!
 A ghost warrior clad in a white armor!
 N-No, IΓÇÖm not afraid of it at all!

 Understood!
 All right, IΓÇÖll leave that to you.
 D-DonΓÇÖt tell me thatΓÇª
 The reason I decided to train Sasuke wasΓÇª
 because he was like me.
 A physical Activation?!
 I seeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why he went through the physical training
 and increased his speed significantlyΓÇª!
 ThatΓÇÖs right!
 AwesomeΓÇª
 The Chakra is clearly visible to the naked eyeΓÇª
 What in the world is happening?!
 DonΓÇÖt tell me that he learned that JutsuΓÇª!
 So this is the Uchiha ClanΓÇª
 ExactlyΓÇª
 W-What the heck is that?!
 What a sound! WhatΓÇÖs that technique?
 ThatΓÇÖs just a jabΓÇª
 Huh?!
 However, it is the one used by Leaf VillageΓÇÖs number one technician.
 ThatΓÇÖs the only original technique of the Copy Ninja, KakashiΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the special technique used only for assassinationsΓÇª
 Its secret is in the speed of the jab,
 and also the physical aptitude that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,
 the ability of the Chakra to focus solely on the target,
 and moreover the speed of the jab makes a ΓÇ£chichichichichiΓÇ¥ soundΓÇª
 A unique sound attack similar to the rumbling of a thousand birds.
 And thatΓÇÖs why that technique is calledΓÇª
 Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
 No way! That GaaraΓÇÖs absolute protection isΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs impossibleΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª
 Excellent workΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 KakashiΓÇÖsΓÇª
 ChidoriΓÇª Also known as Lightning Blade.
 Lightning Blade?
 Lightning Blade is another name for the Jutsu derived
 from KakashiΓÇÖs ability to cut through lightning using that technique.
 Huh? Cut through lightning?
 Huh? That sounds fishyΓÇª
 A-AwesomeΓÇª
 The real name of that technique is ChidoriΓÇª
 The secret is the speed of his jab that surpasses any human limitations
 and the intensity of the Chakra on his armΓÇª
 And that arm turns virtually into the equivalent of the swing
 of a celebrated sword that cuts through everything.
 But what a reckless techniqueΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs not for you to sayΓÇª
 Right, Lee?
 ItΓÇÖs beyond my scope of comprehension, butΓÇª
 What an awesome technique!
 I can understand itΓÇª
 If it were me, if I made a running start at that speed,
 I wouldnΓÇÖt make a direct jab attack on the opponentΓÇª
 Or rather, I couldnΓÇÖt.
 For an opponent,
 a straight line attack just gives him an easy chance to launch a counterblow.
 And moreover, I donΓÇÖt have the eyes to read that counterblow.
 I envy youΓÇªSasuke!
 When I fought you once, I saidΓÇª
 Even if one understands visually,
 itΓÇÖs meaningless unless one can move physicallyΓÇª
 I was filled with a feeling of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you haveΓÇª
 the Sharingan!
 I caught you!

 Prison Specializing in Capital Offenses Ninja.
 Fortunately, because there is a downward trend
 in felonies committed by Shinobi,
 along with the downsizing of the facility, the name was changed as well.
 Incarcerated are murderers,
 those who were involved in leaking classified secrets, and so on.
 They are all criminal NinjaΓÇª
 There havenΓÇÖt been any noticeable disruptions in the past few years
 and the facility has been relatively stable.
 ΓÇô Food! 					ΓÇô Food!
 ItΓÇÖs finally time to eat, isnΓÇÖt it, Elder Brother!
 Yeah! IΓÇÖm so excited!
 Hey! Fujin! Raijin!
 If you donΓÇÖt shut up, youΓÇÖre gonna go without dinner!
 Gimme a break! Those guysΓÇª
 You may pass!
 Hey! Wait!
 YouΓÇÖre hurt, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Go to the dispensary later and have that looked at.
 OkayΓÇª
 All right, next!
 H-Hey, Elder BrotherΓÇª
 Huh?
 Why is the little finger short and weak?
 ThatΓÇÖs easy, Raijin.
 If the little finger was thick and strong,
 then your thumb would have no leg to stand on.
 I-I see!
 Elder BrotherΓÇªElder BrotherΓÇª!
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô A lizard!
 Raijin, youΓÇÖve always been a dandy one from way back.
 W-We havenΓÇÖt had enough to eat, have we, Elder Brother?
 YeahΓÇª
 Not asking permission againΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 WhatΓÇÖs up this time?
 IΓÇÖm starvingΓÇª
 G-Give us something to eat!
 Oh noΓÇª If these guys find out I donΓÇÖt have anythingΓÇª!
 UmΓÇªright nowΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt tell me that you donΓÇÖt have even one offeringΓÇª
 to these Fujin and Raijin brothers?!
 WellΓÇªwaitΓÇªwaitΓÇª!
 What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
 IΓÇÖll bring you something else later!
 Right now make do with that!
 ΓÇô Okay! 					ΓÇô Okay!
 Are you okay?
 Those guys are quiet when they have food.
 But if they get angry theyΓÇÖre out of control.
 YeahΓÇªThey annihilated all their comrades over food during a mission
 and the people around just barely managed to hold them down.
 Something smells good?!
 Yeah.
 This way!
 ΓÇô Food! Food! Food! ΓÇô Food! Food! Food!
 I just canΓÇÖt get to liking clerical work.
 ThereΓÇÖs still a whole lot more to do, Lady Tsunade.
 I wonder what this is?
 It looks like a formula for some kind of medicineΓÇª
 A formulaΓÇª
 Send an available Jonin here immediately!
 Yes, maΓÇÖam?
 Hurry!
 Y-Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 How about itΓÇª Does it taste good?
 I seeΓÇªI seeΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs still a whole lot more.
 Just as I thought,
 that good smell was coming from your place, Elder Brother!
 Uh yeahΓÇªΓÇÖCause Elder Brother always has delicious food!
 It was worth sneaking, wasnΓÇÖt it?
 ΓÇÖCause IΓÇÖd feel so sorry if you guys had to go hungry.
 Elder BrotherΓÇª
 ΓÇô A lizard! 					ΓÇô A lizard!
 I see, I seeΓÇªHappy?
 How about it, you guys?
 DonΓÇÖt you want to eat things that are even more delicious?
 W-Where are they at?!
 If we go to the place where an old friend of mine isΓÇª
 you can pig out on food thatΓÇÖs even more delicious than here.
 Is that the guy you told us about long time ago, Elder Brother?
 Yeah, Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 Gimme a breakΓÇª that guyΓÇÖs gotta be kidding!
 That Pervy SageΓÇª
 just leaving me and my training up in the air!
 Come on, donΓÇÖt say that, Naruto.
 Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
 Heh!
 ItΓÇÖs probably that Lady Tsunade decided
 that only Master Jiraiya could do the jobΓÇª
 It can't be helped.
 Damn! So it was Old Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs doing, after all, huh!
 Well, I guess all I can do is treat you to some ramen noodles like this.
 So cheer up.
 IΓÇÖm gonna go complain to Old Lady Tsunade!
 Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
 N-Naruto!
 DamnΓÇª another annoying situation.
 Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
 This is about a year ago,
 a Chunin Academy staff member used Naruto
 to sneak out the Scroll of Sealing.
 According to the report, it was a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
 The crime was solved, butΓÇª?
 Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
 The possibility has arisen that a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
 This is a clueΓÇª
 This is something that Mizuki was concealing
 when he was incarcerated in the Maximum Security Facility.
 At the time, nobody thought of it as anything more than a doodle.
 Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
 I donΓÇÖt know, howeverΓÇª
 The handwriting resembles the document confiscated from the facility
 where Orochimaru was conducting human experimentsΓÇª
 Which means thatΓÇª Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
 The possibility of that is not zero.
 ItΓÇÖs not like a Chunin alone could do anything with the Scroll of Sealing.
 It would only make sense if Orochimaru were pulling strings from behind.
 Asuma! Kurenai!
 Go immediately to the Maximum Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
 Orochimaru?!
 Be careful! SomethingΓÇÖs strange here!
 YeahΓÇª ItΓÇÖs too quiet.
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Oh, how touching. A welome party for usΓÇª
 YeahΓÇªweΓÇÖre giving you a big welcome. Right, Elder Brother?
 YeahΓÇª
 Asuma, donΓÇÖt tell me that those guys areΓÇª
 Uh huhΓÇªThe legendary idiot brothersΓÇª
 Fujin and Raijin!
 AsumaΓÇª
 Hey, you guys are whooping it up too much for a welcome party!
 Hey, calm downΓÇª the welcome partyΓÇÖs just started.
 His character has changed completelyΓÇª
 All you jerksΓÇª
 You willΓÇªbe our offering!
 Do it!
 Orochimaru!
 Asuma SenseiΓÇª Kurenai Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Ton Ton?
 What in the world happened?
 Say, weren't you together with Shizune?
 Don't tell me something's happened to her?
 I don't know what happened, but take me there, Ton Ton!

 Water Style!
 ΓÇô Water Shark Bomb Jutsu! ΓÇô Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 WellΓÇªI asked you to take care of them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 What business does a Rogue Ninja like you
 have in this village now?
 Kakashi HatakeΓÇª
 Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan
 What?! Why?! Why?!
 Why do I have to go on a research trip with you, Pervy Sage?
 Oh no, this isnΓÇÖt just any research trip.
 ThereΓÇÖs a woman whose data I want to collect.
 So we have to look for her first.
 I really donΓÇÖt have time to accompany you on your perverted research trip!
 Because I have training!
 Hm? Training?
 I will take lessons from Kakashi Sensei and learn a variety of things, like Chidori!
 Kakashi Sensei has been playing favorites lately!
 Well, I think that technique is impossible for you to learn.
 More importantlyΓÇª That woman is really beautiful.
 You want to meet her, donΓÇÖt you?!
 Not at all.
 IΓÇÖm not some kid who can be cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!
 Anyway, no!
 Well, it canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 Oh, wellΓÇª I know Jutsu more amazing than Chidori, butΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª Maybe IΓÇÖll take Sasuke?
 Of course IΓÇÖll go!
 IΓÇÖll pack my bags right away.
 Pervy Sage, donΓÇÖt move!
 IΓÇÖll be darnedΓÇª HeΓÇÖs really a cute kid.
 Those eyes are exactly the same as they used to be in the past.
 That being said, he is a true inheritor of the SharinganΓÇª
 I have to assume the worst-case scenario, just in case.
 This is a surpriseΓÇª No wonder you copied my JutsuΓÇª
 So there really is a fellow besides Itachi who has that eye.
 Your name is Kakashi, the Copy Ninja, wasnΓÇÖt it?
 IΓÇÖm the one who was surprised.
 I saw strange men in the tea house and wondered who they wereΓÇª
 There they were Itachi Uchiha andΓÇª
 the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village, Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Well, wellΓÇª You know even my name. ltΓÇÖs an honor.
 I see. YouΓÇÖre one of the ΓÇ£Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.ΓÇ¥
 That huge sword is the ΓÇ£Shark Skin,ΓÇ¥ right?
 I heard that kid Zabuza had it out with you?
 YeahΓÇª
 You are someone whoΓÇÖs well worth lopping offΓÇª
 Stop itΓÇª Kisame.
 If you were to go at it with that man, it wonΓÇÖt end without cost.
 And if you spend too much time, another Shinobi would come running.
 HoweverΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt lose sight of the goalΓÇª You didnΓÇÖt come here to get injured!
 Let me hear that ΓÇ£goalΓÇ¥ thenΓÇª?
 Just came to find something weΓÇÖre looking for.
 Something youΓÇÖre looking for?
 The thing youΓÇÖre looking forΓÇª What is it?
 IΓÇÖm different from Kisame, I wonΓÇÖt take time.
 Ninja Art: Water Style. Water wall!
 ThatΓÇÖs some Jutsu speed. My eyes couldnΓÇÖt follow the Sign.
 That Shuriken in the right hand was a decoyΓÇª
 to use a Water Style Jutsu to launch an attack below my foot ΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs what to expect from you, Kakashi.
 Your power of analytical eyeΓÇªis great.
 A Shadow Clone?! His Jutsu speed is too fast!
 A water clone?!
 The Copy Ninja has done well this far with Jutsu of my village.
 Nice! Kakashi!
 Get down, Kurenai!
 This one is the Shadow CloneΓÇª
 Huh?
 Kakashi! Kurenai!
 He made the Shadow Clone body explode?!
 A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.
 SakuraΓÇÖs going to start to like meΓÇª
 Maybe!
 Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke will be surprised!
 KakashiΓÇª!
 DonΓÇÖt lower your guardΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs the guy who became a division chief of Anbu Black Ops at 13 years oldΓÇª
 To think heΓÇÖs this powerfulΓÇª
 No, you havenΓÇÖt seen this guyΓÇÖs strength yet.
 I didnΓÇÖt expect that you who are not a member of the Uchiha clan
 would have mastered the Sharingan to that extentΓÇª
 But your body isnΓÇÖt the ΓÇ£Uchiha clanΓÇ¥ body that goes with the eye.
 ThatΓÇÖs right. As a result, my stamina doesn't lastΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a reason why the Uchiha Clan was deemed the strongest and fearedΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll demonstrate the true strength of Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!
 I-It canΓÇÖt be!
 This is bad!
 Both of you! DonΓÇÖt look at his eyes!
 Both of you! DonΓÇÖt look at his eyes!
 Both of you, absolutely do not open your eyesΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs all over now if your eyes meet.
 Only people with Sharingan can have a go with that technique.
 Indeed with Sharingan,
 you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan to a certain extent.
 HoweverΓÇª
 this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,
 Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm, is unbreakable.
 The only person who can bring me down is someone
 using the same Kekkei Genkai, a Sharingan userΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 I wonder how much you can take without the Kekkei Genkai?
 The one just now wasΓÇªGenjutsu?
 In the world of TsukuyomiΓÇª
 Both space and timeΓÇª
 and massΓÇª I control them all.
 For the next 72 hoursΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll stab you continually with swords.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 In the world of TsukuyomiΓÇª
 Both space and timeΓÇª
 and massΓÇª I control them all.
 Calm downΓÇª This is Genjutsu.
 ItΓÇÖs best not to be optimistic and think itΓÇÖs an illusion.
 This pain is not an illusion.
 This pain is absolutely no different from reality.
 How long will your spirit sustain?
 ThereΓÇÖsΓÇª 71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left.
 WhaΓÇª?!
 S-Since thenΓÇª?!
 ThatΓÇÖs all the time that has passed?!
 What happened, Kakashi?!
 Are you saying we should keep our eyes closed still?!
 N-NotΓÇªyetΓÇª
 What happened?!
 Just as that guy finished speaking, you suddenly fell over!
 Three days in that world is less than a moment in the actual world, huhΓÇª
 ButΓÇªwhy doesnΓÇÖt he kill me?
 He could easily do so, if he wants toΓÇª
 WhoaΓÇªTo take that Jutsu without causing his spirit to collapse.
 But ItachiΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs also dangerous for you to overuse those eyes.
 The thing youΓÇÖre looking forΓÇª
 is it Sasuke?
 NoΓÇªthe legacy of the Fourth HokageΓÇª
 These guys. What the heck are they planningΓÇª?
 So, Naruto, is itΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs been a long timeΓÇª
 How many years has it been since you returned to the village?
 KakashiΓÇª
 I will keep Naruto under my care.
 It was an understandable decision of the Third Hokage
 who appointed you to the role of watching over NarutoΓÇª
 But even at your level, you may not be able to handle it properly.
 What in the world are you saying?
 IΓÇÖve been observing Orochimaru ever since he left the villageΓÇª
 It was obvious that he would return to this village sooner or later.
 All told, at first I was concerned only about him, butΓÇª
 What is it?
 The guy joined an organization.
 An organization?
 What are the details of the organization?
 I donΓÇÖt know much of the details,
 but itΓÇÖs a small organization known as Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.
 Until recently, they werenΓÇÖt making any dramatic moves
 except some cloak-and-dagger activities.
 The biggest concern is the members of that organization.
 Almost all of them are listed on the Bingo Book,
 all S-rank deviant criminals.
 That Itachi is among them.
 If the nine of them get together, their intent will not be volunteer activities.
 Since youΓÇÖve been told this much, you already know what it means.
 But recently, Orochimaru pulled out of the organization.
 And at that time,
 other members of the organization went in to action in different areas,
 in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.
 Is there proof that one of those things is the Nine-Tailed Fox?
 ItΓÇÖs possible.
 Because itΓÇÖs one of the spirits who possess the strongest ChakraΓÇª
 KakashiΓÇª
 Sooner or later, that Naruto will have to live watching his backΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs his destiny.
 For now, you should keep your eyes on Sasuke.
 ItΓÇÖs necessary for you to teach him how to use his Sharingan.
 IΓÇÖll take care of Naruto for a while.
 The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto is your target?
 I know that you two arenΓÇÖt the only ones on the moveΓÇª
 The name of your organization is Akatsuki, right?
 Akatsuki?
 Kisame! WeΓÇÖll take Kakashi. Erase the other two.
 Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
 Who are you?
 The LeafΓÇÖs noble, blue fierce animalΓÇª
 Mighty Guy!
 What a sightΓÇª ShouldnΓÇÖt you be called a strange beast?
 DonΓÇÖt underestimate that manΓÇª
 That man is Itachi!
 You did this to KakashiΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt look at ItachiΓÇÖs eyes, Guy! YouΓÇÖll be caught up in his Jutsu!
 I know that already!
 In order to fight Kakashi, I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.
 Open your eyes, both of you!
 B-ButΓÇª
 When you battle with the Sharingan,
 itΓÇÖs not a problem if you donΓÇÖt look at those eyes!
 You work around it by gaining insight into his movements
 by looking constantly at his feet.
 Now that you mention it, youΓÇÖre probably right, butΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre the only one who can do that.
 ThatΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a knack to reading
 all of your opponentsΓÇÖ movements only by his feet.
 But I canΓÇÖt teach it to you in this emergency.
 Just get used it right now!
 What should we do?
 Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.
 Asuma, you are my back-up!
 Okay!
 And until the reinforcements of Anbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,
 I will hang out with you guys.
 InterestingΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs some nerveΓÇª
 KisameΓÇª Pull the plug.
 We didnΓÇÖt come to have a war.
 ItΓÇÖs too bad, but no more of this nonsense.
 WeΓÇÖre leaving.
 Too badΓÇª I was finally feeling motivated.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped.
 All right!
 Here I go!
 Y-YouΓÇÖre putting too much spirit into it.
 YouΓÇÖre not training on a mountain retreat, you know that, right?
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 There's a super beautiful young lady over there!
 She just winked at us!
 Look, Naruto! She must be interested in us!
 She may be cuter than Sakura!
 ΓÇô All right, Naruto! ΓÇô Yeah!
 Go back, train, then go to bed.
 You always do that to me!

 DonΓÇÖt mess around with me!

 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if IΓÇÖm told that there is no bright future
 IΓÇÖll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heartΓÇÖs door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Naruto, what on earth were you thinking?
 What? I only brought an injured person to the hospital.
 But to bring an outsider into the villageΓÇª
 But IΓÇÖm sure he is not a bad guy at all.
 I understand your feelings, but he has amnesia.
 There is a possibility that heΓÇÖs an enemy spy.
 Please, Grandma.
 IΓÇÖll make an exception, just this one time.
 But you will be his keeper, and will be held accountable for all his actions.
 ThatΓÇÖs all.

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 The waves of pain are coming faster...
 Sasuke, you should quit the preliminaries!
 Huh?!
 L-Look, you haven't been yourself
 ever since you got worked over by that Orochimaru guy!
 Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
 To think itΓÇÖd be so soonΓÇª?!
 I couldnΓÇÖt ask for more.
 For the 1st battle,
 Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.
 No objections, right?
 - Right! -No!
 The pain wonΓÇÖt go away!
 It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
 DonΓÇÖt use the Sharingan.
 So you knew?
 If that Curse Mark on your neck gets out of control,
 it could endanger your life.
 I believe it.
 Well, the match will be called off at that time.
 IΓÇÖll be coming in to stop it, so good luck.
 Called off, you say?!
 It seems this Curse Mark thing is responding to my Chakra.
 In other words, in this match,
 I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,
 not to mention the Sharingan!
 HoweverΓÇª YoroiΓÇÖs ability is the worst for you, Sasuke.
 Now then, please begin.
 YouΓÇª my ChakraΓÇª
 You just noticed nowΓÇª?
 Bushy-Brow's Jealousy - Lions Barrage Unleashed!
 YouΓÇª my ChakraΓÇª
 You just noticed nowΓÇª?
 YesΓÇªYoroi has unorthodox ability to absorb Chakra.
 ItΓÇÖs a magnificent art that absorbs spiritual and physical energy
 simply by holding his palm against an opponentΓÇÖs body.
 And, if all of your Chakra is absorbed, Sasuke,
 youΓÇÖll be forced to rely upon the power of my Curse MarkΓÇª
 Now, release that luscious powerΓÇª!
 That is the only way you have to survive.
 YouΓÇªlittle!
 To think you still have strength leftΓÇª
 Though youΓÇÖre just a guinea pig.
 That was a close oneΓÇª
 Put your mind at easeΓÇª IΓÇÖll end this right away!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, whatΓÇÖs the matter?!
 You already finished?!
 His aim is one, close-quarter fight.
 What should I do!?
 At this rate, things will go downhillΓÇª
 Sasuke UchihaΓÇª ls this the best you can do?
 SasukeΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 You call yourself an Uchiha with that?
 DonΓÇÖt be looking so lame!
 Give your best!
 That guyΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs it!
 Oh!
 You canΓÇÖt afford to be inattentive!
 IΓÇÖll finish you with this!
 Is this as far as it goesΓÇª?
 HeΓÇªvanished?!
 ThatΓÇÖs myΓÇª!
 What?!
 Huh?
 But thenΓÇªfrom here on is my original.
 ItΓÇÖs overΓÇª
 The Dancing Leaf ShadowΓÇª?!
 Eat this!
 Dang itΓÇª! ltΓÇÖs responding every timeΓÇª
 PleaseΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖm begging youΓÇª
 Stop!
 You! Sasuke! DonΓÇÖt be looking so lame!
 To think theyΓÇÖd be worried about meΓÇª
 Is this itΓÇª?
 I wonΓÇÖt be swallowed upΓÇª by this thing...
 No way!
 The Curse Mark receded!?
 Here I go!
 YouΓÇÖre weak!
 YouΓÇÖre weak.
 IΓÇÖm not done, yet!
 Lions Barrage!
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to check.
 IΓÇÖm stopping the match from going any furtherΓÇª
 Therefore, the winner of the first battle, Sasuke UchihaΓÇª
 passes the preliminaries!
 Yes!
 Well. Good jobΓÇª
 Before that Lions Barrage,
 your movements were that of GuyΓÇÖs TaijutsuΓÇª
 So you copied it with the Sharingan
 when you wrangled that one time with that Lee kid?
 Sasuke! You, youΓÇª
 won in a lame way!
 Look at you, all battered up! You idiot!
 Man, that loserΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇªThank goodness.
 Okay, IΓÇÖll win, too!
 LeeΓÇª Because of you,  IΓÇÖve managed to save my neck.
 Things wouldΓÇÖve gotten hairy
 if I hadnΓÇÖt seen your technique in close-quarters combat.
 But it doesnΓÇÖt appear to be a technique that I can use heavily.
 I seeΓÇª So before, he copied a part of the technique I only used once?
 Sharingan!
 ThatΓÇÖs your abilityΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª youΓÇÖre quite a person.
 You get rapidly strongerΓÇª
 I kind ofΓÇªfeel a bit of fear.
 For a sequence of high-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,
 itΓÇÖs impossible to acquire this without training
 that whittles away flesh and blood.
 No matter how much you use the Sharingan,
 it canΓÇÖt just be mastered in a short space of timeΓÇª
 Moreover, his idea for that finishing moveΓÇª
 KakashiΓÇª this boy reminds me of when you were a kidΓÇª
 Last yearΓÇÖs number one rookie was Neji Hyuga.
 This yearΓÇÖs number one rookie is Sasuke Uchiha.
 I wonder which one is strongerΓÇª?
 Really, heΓÇÖs something else.
 To think heΓÇÖd develop the true power of the Sharingan in situation like thisΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs most to be fearedΓÇª is the Uchiha ability?
 That was surprisingΓÇª
 To think he brought the Curse Mark that was getting out of control
 into submission with his willΓÇª
 Tsk. Again?
 It just make it more interesting!
 Yeah! He is Sasuke after allΓÇª
 This is as far as weΓÇÖll goΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm hungryΓÇª
 W-Wow!
 Nothing special.
 MagnificentΓÇª
 Sasuke Uchiha...
 We medics will give you the best of treatment.
 You guys are out of your territory.
 Huh?!
 IΓÇÖll take him under my careΓÇª
 Now, IΓÇÖll take you into the backΓÇª
 and seal the Curse Mark.
 Can we wait until the preliminaries are over?!
 I want to watch the matches of those who will remain in the main battle.
 No!
 DonΓÇÖt get so heated.
 If we let things be any further,
 the situation might become irrevocable.
 I wonΓÇÖt accommodate you anymore.
 Now then, come onΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Hm?
 Sakura... Speaking of which, during the matchΓÇª
 did you see something that looked like a strange wound on SasukeΓÇÖs neck?
 What?
 Please promise meΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt say anything about this bruise to Naruto.
 What?
 ListenΓÇª this is also teamwork.
 It wonΓÇÖt do to have him unnecessarily worried.
 I-I donΓÇÖt know either.
 I seeΓÇª
 Umm, now thenΓÇª
 We will get right to it and begin the second match.
 Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame
 Which weakling is it?!
 Both of you, come forward.
 We will now begin the second match.
 ThatΓÇÖs the Sound NinjaΓÇª
 The guy who had both his arms broken by Sasuke!
 It seems like youΓÇÖre proud of your armsΓÇª
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 HeΓÇÖs going to fight with those arms?
 I wonder if Shino is going to be okayΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs fine. HeΓÇÖs strong!
 WhatΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖd square off with anybody except himΓÇª
 Now then, please begin.
 Now, ZakuΓÇª
 How you fight will be a sight to seeΓÇª
 If you fight here, youΓÇÖll be finishedΓÇª
 Withdraw!
 Somehow, this one still works, soΓÇª
 One arm is enough to take care of you!
 You canΓÇÖt beat me with just one arm.
 Stop pestering me!
 Take this!
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 Okay.
 Hang in there. ltΓÇÖll be over right away.
 Curse Sealing!
 Next time, even if that Curse Mark starts kicking in againΓÇª
 the power of this Curse Sealing should suppress it.
 However, this Sealing Jutsu makes the strength of your will its foundation.
 If something happens like you not believing in your own strength
 and that will were to weakenΓÇª
 the Curse Mark will once again start to rage.
 Out of character.
 It appears heΓÇÖs quite tiredΓÇª
 To think youΓÇÖve become able to handle Sealing JutsuΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve grown, eh, KakashiΓÇª?
 YouΓÇª
 Long time no see, Kakashi.
 OrochimaruΓÇª
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 This is surprising.
 I never thought youΓÇÖd appear.
 Why are you after Sasuke? WhatΓÇÖs your purpose?!
 Even though youΓÇÖre one of the legendary three Ninja,
 I must not retreat.
 IΓÇÖll stop you here, even if it costs my life!

117,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Heh! ItΓÇÖs overΓÇª
 Losing is not an Option
 What?!
 Just barelyΓÇª
 That was a close one.
 ButΓÇªI was able to throw it off just a little.
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 HeΓÇÖs now realized the secret of the Byakugan.
 WhatΓÇÖs the meaning of this? How?!
 How was he able to throw it
 a whole six inches from his vital point?!
 I seeΓÇª That Chakra!
 He was emitting Chakra the whole time
 and covered the area surrounding him!
 And in a wide range to that extent.
 No wonder he was able to detect the arrow and
 throw off the trajectory of it.
 But constantly emitting that much Chakra is a death throeΓÇª
 If he doesnΓÇÖt go that far, he canΓÇÖt dodge.
 In other words, thereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 ItΓÇÖs as I hypothesizedΓÇª
 The arrow earlier was totally invisible to him!
 He doesnΓÇÖt carry out useless attacksΓÇª
 And from the results, he accurately examines the information.
 AndΓÇªheΓÇÖs also discovered the weakness of my eyesΓÇª
 Impressive.
 Of all the enemies IΓÇÖve fought until now,
 this guyΓÇÖs the strongest!
 He has 360-degree sight.
 And he unfailingly detects attacks
 that penetrate the roughly 150-feeot circumference around him.
 But for some reason,
 there were Kunai Knives he couldnΓÇÖt evade completely.
 Why couldnΓÇÖt he evade them?
 Because he couldnΓÇÖt see them!
 In other words, even his Visual Jutsu has a slight blind spot!
 Being unable to see Kunai Knives entering that blind spot,
 heΓÇÖs unable to react.
 So he was dealing with attacks from the blind spot
 with that defense technique.
 And I analyzed all the attacks I carried out
 and grasped them perfectly.
 Right behind his first thoracic vertebraΓÇª
 there exists a blind spot expanding from a very small point.
 Indeed, if he moves and doesnΓÇÖt stabilize the blind spot,
 it becomes difficult to aim there with an arrow.
 But such a trickΓÇªdoesnΓÇÖt fool me!
 Gentle Fist is pointless if you donΓÇÖt come close to your enemy.
 And you canΓÇÖt afford to think about approaching me at this point.
 ItΓÇÖs about how to escape nowΓÇª
 Though whether you struggle or not, youΓÇÖre going to die anyway.
 HehΓÇª It seems you only have a little Chakra left.
 The fate of the small fry character in an easy game
 is to be destroyed right away!
 ItΓÇÖs useless!
 A thread?!
 I see, with this threadΓÇª
 This time, the trajectory was thrown off slightly by the trees, huh?
 If thatΓÇÖs the caseΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll add some rotation this time.
 So even if it hits a tree,
 itΓÇÖll just cut through and the trajectory wonΓÇÖt be thrown off.
 And as beforeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll control the arrow up until 150 feet away from him
 using a thread with Chakra flowing through.
 IΓÇÖll take aim at the moving targetΓÇª
 and plunge the arrow into the blind spot with a pinpoint attack!
 HeΓÇÖs still standing up?
 HeΓÇÖs strongΓÇª HeΓÇÖs much stronger than me.
 I hardly have any Chakra left now.
 I probably wonΓÇÖt be able to evade his next attack completely.
 Is this it?
 IΓÇÖll win no matter what!
 NarutoΓÇª I wonder what youΓÇÖd do.
 IΓÇÖve had enough.
 I canΓÇÖt dodge it anyway.
 HeΓÇÖs stopped movingΓÇª Has he given up?
 But just to make doubly sureΓÇª
 Maximum destructive power with 120% accuracy.
 IΓÇÖve got him!
 This is it.
 Gentle Fist!
 Wh-What? He stillΓÇª?!
 No! My attack just now shouldΓÇÖve made the kill.
 Substance with Chakra baseΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs meaningless against Gentle Fist.
 Gentle FistΓÇª
 I see, in his final moments,
 he funneled the last Chakra through the thread!
 Eight crowsΓÇª
 Again I couldnΓÇÖt see one of them.
 What happened to him?
 He damaged several of my internal organs.
 ButΓÇªI can still move.
 You failureΓÇª
 I told youΓÇª I donΓÇÖt know when to quit!
 Why do you try to go against your destiny that much?
 Because I was calledΓÇªa failure!
 But if youΓÇÖre going to say itΓÇÖs futile, you donΓÇÖt have to do anything!
 After I become the Hokage, IΓÇÖll change Hyuga!
 The Ninjutsu that youΓÇÖre good at, huh?
 I was carelessΓÇª
 Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
 DonΓÇÖt be whining about boring stuff like destiny and what not,
 and how it canΓÇÖt be changed!
 Unlike me,
 you're not a failure.
 NarutoΓÇª
 Now itΓÇÖs become the three of usΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt worry about such things.
 Both Choji and Neji will catch up right away.
 Choji had the trump card.
 And IΓÇÖve fought Neji in the Chunin exam, so I knowΓÇª
 Know what?
 That heΓÇÖsΓÇªa true genius. Believe it!
 I cannot loseΓÇª
 Whether heΓÇÖs an enemy much stronger than meΓÇª
 or even if this body should fail meΓÇª
 I cannot lose!
 I have a reason why I cannot lose!
 IΓÇÖve had a hard time of it this time.
 I played too longΓÇª
 Huh?
 I canΓÇÖt build up ChakraΓÇª
 How? You shouldΓÇÖve been instantly killed!
 How come youΓÇÖre alive?!
 I couldnΓÇÖt completely evade it anyway.
 So I was prepared to deliberately take the hit.
 And I knew of my own weakness much more than you doΓÇª
 There were eight crows, huh?
 This Byakugan has a blind spot.
 However, if I knew that your attack would only come from thereΓÇª
 I could release my Chakra just to that blind spot and detect the attack.
 ItΓÇÖs not so difficult to make
 a move of just a few inches to throw off the aim.
 IΓÇÖd suffer a serious injury, but instant death can be avoided.
 So you took the hit deliberatelyΓÇª?
 It doesnΓÇÖt change the fact that youΓÇÖre going to die here.
 How can you go that far?!
 ΓÇ£Of all the enemies,ΓÇ¥ youΓÇÖre the strongest IΓÇÖve ever foughtΓÇª
 But, thereΓÇÖs a reason why I cannot lose.
 Of all those IΓÇÖve ever fought, the strongest one said this to meΓÇª
 ΓÇô Unlike meΓÇªyou are not a failure! ΓÇô Unlike meΓÇªyou are not a failure!
 He said that.
 IΓÇÖve been called a genius all along.
 So I cannot lose.
 And for the sake of those guys who believe
 that this humdrum and small me is a genius!
 ΓÇ£The fate of the small fry character in a game is to be destroyed right away.ΓÇ¥
 You said that, didnΓÇÖt you?
 Look at this situation!
 Things like fate, isnΓÇÖt determined by someone!
 I wonderΓÇª
 You also look like youΓÇÖre going to die!
 Neji, live.
 More than anyone in the clan,
 youΓÇÖre the man loved most by the Hyuga abilityΓÇª
 I cannot die so easily.
 Even if you act tough, you canΓÇÖt stem the current nowΓÇª
 Master Sasuke ran to the Sound Village by his own wish.

 I told you IΓÇÖm not such a fool, didnΓÇÖt I?
 I already knowΓÇª which one is the real one.
 Oh.
 That is the body that has least attacks
 due to its fear of having Chakra Points attacked.
 The more you attack,
 the more that one body becomes clearly evident.
 YouΓÇÖre the real one.
 NarutoΓÇª
 This is as far as it goes.
 I said it was pointless.
 DonΓÇÖt let him beat you, Naruto.
 IΓÇÖve been telling you not to frivolously assume things.
 What?
 It canΓÇÖt be.
 All right! Go, Naruto!
 NarutoΓÇª!
 He foiled my idea and purposely and drew one of his clones back?
 IΓÇÖve been striking from the beginning, prepared for an honorable death!
 Believe it!
 I did it.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 W-What was that?
 Did you think youΓÇÖd won?
 Why?
 NarutoΓÇÖs punch shouldΓÇÖve hit.
 ThatΓÇª
 Rotation...
 ThatΓÇÖs NejiΓÇÖs defense.
 You punk. DonΓÇÖt make a fool of me.
 The largest range of vision of NejiΓÇÖs Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.
 And he detects all of his opponentΓÇÖs attacks with the Byakugan.
 His defense technique, the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,
 will begin from here.
 The moment heΓÇÖs attacked, he discharges a large amount of Chakra
 from the Chakra holes in the body, blocks the enemyΓÇÖs attack with that Chakra,
 moves his own body in a circular motion, dodges and repels.
 Essentially, itΓÇÖs difficult to control the Chakra discharged from Chakra holesΓÇª
 To the extent that even Jonin utilize the discharge from a part of the body,
 like the hands and feet, in techniques.
 But Neji who has mastered Gentle Fist discharges Chakra
 from his entire body and shuts out physical attacks
 just with that discharge power.
 In other words,
 thatΓÇÖs one more absolute defense
 that has more power than that GaaraΓÇÖs Sand Shield.
 T-ThatΓÇÖs fatherΓÇÖsΓÇª
 The Rotation is a secret Art passed down from generation to generation
 only to the Hyuga head family, in other words the Hyuga clan.
 He created that on his ownΓÇª?
 HeΓÇÖs quite the guyΓÇª To think heΓÇÖd come this far.
 ItΓÇÖs much too soon to be surprised. NejiΓÇÖs true power is still to come.
 Dang it.
 This is the end.
 YouΓÇÖre within the area of my 8 Trigrams.
 Gentle Fist Art.

 would be passed on so strongly to a child of the branch family
 who would never be able to be an heir.

 Hey, you.
 ItΓÇÖs okay. IΓÇÖm a doctor.
 OkayΓÇª Fine.
 If you insist, IΓÇÖll tell you about the HyugaΓÇÖs destiny of hatred.
 In the Hyuga head family, thereΓÇÖs a secret Ninjutsu
 thatΓÇÖs been passed on from generation to generation.
 That is the Curse Mark Arts.
 Curse Mark Arts?
 The Curse Mark represents a bird in a cageΓÇª
 and itΓÇÖs a mark of those who are bound to a destiny they canΓÇÖt escape.
 W-WhatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 ...t-that mark?
 One day when I was four years old,
 this accursed mark was inscribed on my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.
 A large ceremony was held in the Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.
 It was also the day when the head Ninja of the Land of Lightning,
 the land that the Leaf had fought with for many years,
 came for the conclusion of the allied treaty.
 However, there was one clanΓÇª
 who didnΓÇÖt attend the ceremony that was attended
 by everybody else, from Leaf Jonin to Genin.
 It was the Hyuga clanΓÇª
 And itΓÇÖs because that day was the day of hope
 when the head family heir was to turn three.
 Miss HinataΓÇÖs third birthday!
 My father, Hizashi Hyuga,
 and Miss HinataΓÇÖs father whoΓÇÖs over there, Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.
 However, Miss HinataΓÇÖs father, Lord Hiashi,
 is the eldest son of the head family born into this world first.
 And my father who was the second son is a member of the branch family.
 So Miss Hinata is already threeΓÇª
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 SheΓÇÖs a cute girl, isnΓÇÖt she, father?
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, father?
 Oh, itΓÇÖs nothing.
 ThenΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.
 Yes.
 When the head family heir grew and became three years old,
 I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me and I became the bird in the cage.
 And became the Hyuga branch family.
 WhyΓÇÖs it necessary to do something like that?
 Why separate into a head family and a branch family?
 What does that weird mark mean?
 This mark on my forehead isnΓÇÖt just a decoration.
 The pull of your legs is weak.
 Yes.
 Listen, Neji.
 You will live to protect Miss Hinata of the head family
 as well as the Hyuga power.
 Yes, father.
 Murderous Intent.
 My head.
 Father.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, father?
 Go home. IΓÇÖll forgive the fool today only.
 YouΓÇÖre not to forget your destiny.
 This Curse Mark is the absolute fear called death so to speakΓÇª
 that was given to the branch family by the head family.
 The Secret Sign that the head family members form easily
 destroys the cerebral nerves of those in the branch family.
 Of course, killing is easy.
 And this mark only goes away at time of death.
 Sealing away the power of the Byakugan.
 The Hyuga family is the clan that possesses the most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.
 ThereΓÇÖs no end to those who target the secret of that distinctive power.
 In other words, this Curse Mark keeps the branch family alive
 only to protect the head family and does not allow disobedience.
 And itΓÇÖs an effective system created to defend for eternity
 the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.
 And then, that incident occurred.
 My father was killed by the head family.
 One night, Miss Hinata was snatched up by someone.
 At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately rushed off and killed the abductor.
 Who do you think that person wasΓÇª
 who was in the shadows, and also wearing a mask?
 It was the head ninja of the Land of Lightning
 who had just completed the allied treaty.
 It was clear that he came targeting the secret of Byakugan from the start.
 However, the Land of Lightning exploited the killing of their own Ninja
 due to a botched planΓÇª
 and set an outrageous condition in violation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf.
 Naturally, things got worse and worse,
 and there was almost a war between the Leaf and the Lightning.
 However, the Leaf who wanted to avoid war
 made a deal with the Lightning.
 A deal?
 The Lightning demand was the body of the Hyuga head family
 who possesses Byakugan, the Kekkei GenkaiΓÇª
 In other words, the body of Lord Hiashi.
 And the Leaf accepted the condition.
 What? But, fatherΓÇª
 And war was safely avoided.
 Thanks to my father who was killed as a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,
 to protect the head family!
 Other than dying, thereΓÇÖs no other way to escape this accursed Curse Mark.
 Even though they were twins with nearly equal power,
 their destinies were already set by who was born first and born later.
 And then, this matchΓÇª
 Your destiny was decided at the point when I became your opponent.
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

 Are all my Chakra Points really closed?
 Darn. I cannot feel any Chakra remaining in my body at allΓÇª

 Summoning Jutsu!
 This time for sure, the frog willΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs a frog anyway?!
 From which stage do you call it a frog?!
 Live or Die: Risk it All to Win it All!
 Hey! Hold up a hope on me a bit, would you?!
 WhewΓÇª he collapsed againΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs no surpriseΓÇª
 For three weeks, heΓÇÖs continued his training on guts aloneΓÇª
 Lord Hokage.
 Anko, is itΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖm sorry, IΓÇÖm...
 Regretting returning alive from the Forest of Death?
 ThatΓÇÖs a needless thing because you and Orochimaru have no connection at all.
 There is no Shinobi who can compete against that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.
 Even if I was the one to face himΓÇª
 If the Fourth Hokage were still aliveΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt say that.
 He already saved this village and diedΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs a story from 13 years ago. HeΓÇÖs no longer here.
 We have to do something with our power.
 Yes.
 IΓÇÖm going to get some fesh airΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt blame yourself.
 CΓÇÖmon, open your eyes already.
 W-WhatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 To be clear, you have no sense.
 Oh! Pervy Sage!
 After youΓÇÖve been training for 3 weeks, you are still this level.
 If you continue like this itΓÇÖs pointless.
 ThatΓÇÖs not how it is! IΓÇÖm doing this with all my might!
 I understand that, if you really want to succeed at Summoning Jutsu,
 you have to do it like youΓÇÖre going to die or itΓÇÖs no good at all.
 ThatΓÇÖs what IΓÇÖm doing!
 I drill my Chakra every day like IΓÇÖm going to die.
 If you have time to complain about it, teach me a trick or something!
 A trick, huhΓÇª A trick.
 What?! YouΓÇÖre going to teach me?
 You need to risk your life on it.
 L-LifeΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs not a joke. Even so, will you do it?
 O-Of course! I always risk my life!
 I seeΓÇª
 HuhΓÇª?
 Well then, follow me.
 What are we doing at a place like this?
 YouΓÇÖre not gonna peek again, are you?
 Well, that would be nice, but today itΓÇÖs a bath.
 First, we purify our bodiesΓÇª
 Huh?
 ThereΓÇÖs something strange going onΓÇª
 This is such a nice bath.
 Like heavenΓÇª Truly heavenlyΓÇª
 Hey, Pervy Sage.
 IΓÇÖm Toad Sage.
 Whatever, but how are taking a bath and Summoning related?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey--!
 What is it?!
 Hey, Naruto.
 Huh?
 Is there something you want to eat?
 IΓÇÖm going to eat!
 ItΓÇÖs good! If the training is like this, IΓÇÖll do it every day!
 Eat up! Because this is the lastΓÇª
 Huh?
 No, nothing. Anyway, eat! Eat a lot!
 Like thereΓÇÖs no looking back!
 I donΓÇÖt know whatΓÇÖs going on, but I should eat, right? Okay!
 Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!
 Gotcha!
 One more!
 Coming right up!
 This time miso char siu!
 Yeah!
 I ate, I ate.
 Thank you, Pervy SageΓÇª
 What?!
 Thanks for your patronage!
 I wonΓÇÖt even get blood from itΓÇª
 Yo, are you full?
 DonΓÇÖt mess with me, Pervy Sage!
 WerenΓÇÖt you treating me with the meal!
 Fool! Who said that I was treating you?!
 ArenΓÇÖt you a grown-up?! Bastard!
 By the by, Naruto, isnΓÇÖt there a girl that you like?
 Huh?
 I asked if you have a lovely girl?
 WellΓÇªyou could say sheΓÇÖs there, you could say I like herΓÇª
 You could say itΓÇÖs Sakura.
 So there is?
 ItΓÇÖs Sakura!
 Okay! Then go and hug that girl tight!
 What?!
 Is that a part of the training?
 Well, close enough.
 Okay! Right awayΓÇª
 But if I do that, Sakura willΓÇª
 No! This is training too! I have to do it or I wonΓÇÖt be strongΓÇª
 But if I do that, Sakura willΓÇª
 For a while she wonΓÇÖt talk to meΓÇª
 No! If IΓÇÖm going to master Summoning Jutsu,
 this canΓÇÖt be helped!
 ButΓÇªSakura willΓÇª
 No! ButΓÇª
 Hurry up and go!
 What do you want?
 No, uhΓÇªwellΓÇª
 If itΓÇÖs money you want, I wonΓÇÖt lend it to you.
 I may not look it, but IΓÇÖm stingy with money.
 No, thatΓÇÖs not itΓÇª
 WellΓÇª
 Uh, if I tell her itΓÇÖs for my training, sheΓÇÖs sure to beat me.
 If thereΓÇÖs nothing you want, then I ΓÇÖll go home.
 W-Wait a minute!
 OhΓÇª
 This is it! This is my chance!
 Sakura! IΓÇÖm sorry!
 Hey!
 What are you doing?!
 Cha!
 OwΓÇª OuchΓÇª
 This is a part of being youngΓÇª
 Hey, if I do this IΓÇÖll really get a frog?
 Yes, thatΓÇÖs a definite.
 ReallyΓÇª?
 Is there anything youΓÇÖve left undone?
 Huh?
 None?
 What are you talking aboutΓÇª?
 To pull out enormous Chakra and use it.
 It is certain that it is difficult to have the control to do itΓÇª
 It is also certain that this body is a vessel too small
 to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox ChakraΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs likely that NarutoΓÇÖs body normally tends to reject
 the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox in order to avoid too much strain.
 If the excitement of danger and emotion are the key
 to drawing out the Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇÖs ChakraΓÇª
 he has to learn physically until he can automatically use that key.
 Nothing personalΓÇª Fourth Hokage!
 Huh? WhereΓÇªis thisΓÇª?
 Stand up!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 Your training ends here.
 Huh? I havenΓÇÖt done anything yetΓÇª!
 Naruto!
 Go die and come back.
 Die?
 From within the dreadfulness of death, squeeze out enormous Chakra!
 Experience it with your own body, and grasp the technique of it!
 If you donΓÇÖt want to die, do something about it yourselfΓÇª Got it?
 NowΓÇªweΓÇÖll see if the strength given to you is really yours.
 If I donΓÇÖt grab onto thisΓÇª IΓÇÖll die!
 Now!
 ItΓÇÖs impossibleΓÇª
 This rock surface is slippery from the seepage of the waterfall.
 Besides, falling in that speed with the control of Chakra that you have,
 you canΓÇÖt cling to the rock.
 Naruto, after thisΓÇª
 you can only depend on the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
 Open up the keyΓÇª This time from your side!
 If I go on like this! lf I go on like this! IΓÇÖll seriously die!
 Die!
 DieΓÇª
 Today, weΓÇÖll have a history lesson outside.
 As you know, this rock face has the faces of the Hokage line.
 In order from the left, theyΓÇÖre lined up fom the First,
 the SecondΓÇª the ThirdΓÇªand the Fourth.
 So different from the present old man.
 Especially the receding hairlineΓÇª
 Iruka Sensei! WhoΓÇÖs the Fifth?
 Hmm?
 Well, that hasnΓÇÖt been decided yetΓÇª
 Perhaps itΓÇÖs your teacher here!
 HmmΓÇª Weaving an occasional joke to make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?
 L-Lord Hokage!
 Oh, itΓÇÖs the Third.
 Hey! Old man! What did you come to do?
 I wanted to see the rock faces too.
 YouΓÇÖve come at a good time. Over this way, my lord.
 This is the real man of the third rock face!
 The Third Hokage!
 The third was called the strongest, a genius,
 called ΓÇ£professorΓÇ¥ among past Hokage!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 Hey! Iruka, donΓÇÖt say it in the past tense.
 S-Sorry.
 Are you really strong?
 Yeah, you donΓÇÖt look it!
 Yep! ThatΓÇÖs right!
 Enough!
 To take over the name of Hokage means youΓÇÖre the strongest in this village!
 Okay! IΓÇÖm going to become the Fifth Hokage!
 After all IΓÇÖm really strong, and handsome too!
 It wonΓÇÖt work with the scores you have now!
 YouΓÇÖve got a lot of confidence!
 You all are quite young, unlike me!
 There might be someone who will take the name of Hokage is in this group.
 You only have one life!
 DonΓÇÖt choose an impossible road.
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter if you live as you like and die as you like.
 HoweverΓÇª
 no matter what route you take,
 remember to protect the people important to you!
 Important people?
 That you acknowledgeΓÇª trust and love from your heart.
 Do you have people like that?
 Y-YeahΓÇª Dad and MomΓÇª
 and I hate him a little, but my big brother too.
 AndΓÇª 					my dog GontaΓÇª
 For me, itΓÇÖs friends!
 Me too!
 Lord Hokage, you have people like that too?
 Yes, of course I do!
 Really! Who, who?
 I have my grandchildΓÇª Konohamaru over there andΓÇª
 All of the people in this village!
 Like you did too, onceΓÇª
 Huh?!
 This feelingΓÇª ItΓÇÖs that ChakraΓÇª
 This isΓÇª

 I-ItΓÇÖs hugeΓÇª What is it?
 Hey kid, come closer!
 I want to eat and kill you, but this gate wonΓÇÖt openΓÇª
 Bloody spell that sealsΓÇª
 You'reΓÇª
 the Nine-Tailed Fox!
 I seeΓÇª the red Chakra was this guyΓÇÖs Chakra.
 For you to approach meΓÇª
 What business brought you here?
 Hey! You stupid fox!
 Since youΓÇÖre staying in my body, as your rent, lend me your Chakra!
 After all, if you die I die.
 ThatΓÇÖs some impressive courage for threatening me!
 ThatΓÇÖs fineΓÇª
 As a reward for making it this farΓÇª IΓÇÖll give it to you!
 This is the feeling!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Well done.
 Where am I?!

 Yay! This time for sure, IΓÇÖve finally brought out the real toad.
 Listen, you giant toad, I am your master from today!
 Huh? No, nothing.
 I will be your henchman, boss.
 IΓÇÖm so happyΓÇª

187,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now weΓÇÖve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 WeΓÇÖre sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 It looks like the preparations are complete.
 So this is the Land of Greens you were talking about, brother?
 Well, itΓÇÖs a small land,
 but it could be a good stepping-stone for getting ahead in the world.
 WeΓÇÖve already bought off half of the public officials.
 This land will be overturned on our signal.
 As of today, weΓÇÖre the feudal lords of this land.
 Feudal lords, huhΓÇª?
 That has a nice ring to it.
 Open for Business! The Leaf Moving Service
 This is a problemΓÇª
 I thought about testing out various combinations, but it backfired.
 With these remaining members, thereΓÇÖs nobody who can take the leadΓÇª
 But itΓÇÖs merchant protection this time,
 so no matter who goes, there probably isnΓÇÖt much to worry about.
 Mission difficulty isnΓÇÖt the issue.
 ItΓÇÖs a commission from the Land of Greens.
 I wanted to send them a respectable team.
 The lord of the castle there was good to me in the old days!
 True indeedΓÇª
 He generously assumed the debts for the bundle you blew on gambling.
 ItΓÇÖs small, but itΓÇÖs a nice and easygoing land.
 There was an adorable princess, and two boy Ninja looked after herΓÇª
 At that time, they both said theyΓÇÖd marry meΓÇª
 I wonder if they still feel that wayΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt think so.
 I bet theyΓÇÖve all gotten bigΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll be at the border soon.
 This is our last look at this scenery for a while.
 All right! A mission, a mission!
 Wait up, Naruto!
 Everyone else was off on missions,
 but I've been doing nothing but odd jobs in the village!
 I was sick of hearing stories about everyoneΓÇÖs adventures.
 Still, weΓÇÖre guarding merchants this time.
 It ΓÇÿs probably not something to brag about.
 Then I should exaggerate the story a bit
 and say that I took out about a thousand bandits, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs just lyingΓÇª
 Oh! There they are. ThatΓÇÖs them!
 Yahoo!
 WhoΓÇÖre you?
 You guys are merchants from the Land of Greens, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 WeΓÇÖve come from the Village Hidden in Leaves
 to protect you guys. Believe it.
 The Village Hidden in Leaves?
 SeeΓÇª? 					This, this.
 We were told to protect you from mountain banditsΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs for certain.
 IΓÇÖm Naruto Uzumaki.
 And this is Hinata.
 IΓÇÖm Choji Akimichi.
 Um, we received one more item from the Hokage
 to identify ourselves with.
 Hey, Momiji.
 Give it back.
 Oh, itΓÇÖs true.
 These people are from the Village of the Hidden Leaf.

 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs that?
 Old lady TsunadeΓÇª sheΓÇÖs done it this time!
 I see.
 IΓÇÖm Kikusuke.
 This is Yurinoshin.
 HeΓÇÖs Shun.
 IΓÇÖm Momiji! WeΓÇÖll be counting on you movers!
 You sure eat a lot.
 ThatΓÇÖs why you're so fΓÇª
 Fa?!
 ΓÇªfull figured.
 For you.
 I love people with great strength.
 Something like this is a cinch.
 See? Watch.
 Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-rollΓÇª
 Somebody help me!
 That Choji, getting all carried away.
 Move faster, mover.
 WeΓÇÖre rapidly falling behind.
 WeΓÇÖre not movers, IΓÇÖm telling you.
 Why donΓÇÖt you help out before complaining?!
 No, itΓÇÖs fine.
 Our cousin Shun is in poor health.
 You donΓÇÖt need to worry, Kikusuke, Yurinoshin.
 I had no intention of listening to anything
 this good-for-nothing has had to say from the start.
 WhoΓÇÖs a good-for-nothing?! Just you watch!
 Honestly, itΓÇÖs because you push yourself too farΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª ShunΓÇÖs being unreasonable.
 Water! 					Oh.
 MineΓÇÖs empty, too.
 Then thereΓÇÖs some fresh drawn water.
 Here!
 Wow, howΓÇÖd you find water in a place like this?
 My grandma taught me.
 Your grandma?
 It's thisΓÇª
 You can tell with this.
 What?! 					With those?
 ItΓÇÖs called dousing.
 If you concentrate on the item youΓÇÖre looking forΓÇª
 these rods will react to that item and will inform you when you're near it.
 ItΓÇÖs knowledge passed on from our predecessors.
 When I get back to the village,
 maybe I'll try to find money that people dropped with that.
 Tasty!
 It doesnΓÇÖt compare to the water in the Land of Greens, but it's good water.
 Come to think of it, what kind of place is the Land of Greens?
 The Land of Greens isΓÇª a small land deep in the mountains.
 Everyone in the land loves nature and is warm-hearted.
 It was indeed Shangri-LaΓÇª
 WasΓÇª?
 Oh, itΓÇÖs nothingΓÇª
 But, you know, if itΓÇÖs such a great place, why do you need protection?
 ItΓÇÖs targeted because the people take peace for granted!
 What do you mean by that?
 Stuff like loving nature and being warm-hearted sounds nice.
 But the bottom line is that the people in the Land of Greens are all softhearted.
 We live in a troubled time now.
 Something like believing in people is ridiculous.
 Hey, the Land of Greens is not something to speak ill of like that.
 The lord of the castle there was kind even to us merchants passing through.
 To think heΓÇÖd take up that kind of attitude with an old ladyΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs kind of disagreeable.
 HeΓÇÖs your cousin, right? Do something about him.
 R-Right.
 HeΓÇÖs probably a bit touchy from the bad things that have happened.
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 Oh, i-itΓÇÖs okayΓÇª
 Hey, thatΓÇÖs dangerous.
 ItΓÇÖs dangerous to wander around alone.
 Brother Choji, look at thatΓÇª
 Naruto!
 What is it?
 That.
 Wh-What is that?
 ThatΓÇÖs in the direction of the Land of Greens, right?!
 IΓÇÖm going to go check it outΓÇª You take the others and go on ahead.
 IΓÇÖll be right back.
 Listen.
 What we saw here is a secret.
 We donΓÇÖt want everyone to get worried.
 Yeah. 					Got it.
 Huh? WhereΓÇÖs Naruto?
 Th-The bathroomΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll give this to you if you tell me what you saw earlier.
 Black smokeΓÇª 					was rising.
 Black smokeΓÇª?! 					From where?
 The direction of the Land of Greens.
 Lord ShunΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs finallyΓÇª
 I should be at the Land of Greens border pretty soon.
 Wh-What was that ΓÇª? There was no presence at all.
 WhoΓÇÖre you guys!
 WhoΓÇÖre you guys?
 That headband. YouΓÇÖre with the Hidden Leaf Village, right?
 So what if I am? Why are you targeting me?
 I have no intention of fighting you guys.
 It seems the ones we are looking for are heading this direction, you see.
 Those who prowl around here will die.
 Did we do itΓÇª?
 The Substitution Jutsu?!
 The real one is over here!
 These guys are pretty good.
 Two left.
 One of them is the real one!
 What?!
 Too bad! Those two are also clones.
 IΓÇÖm going to turn back for nowΓÇª
 Choji! Hinata!
 HowΓÇÖd it go, Naruto?
 Actually, thereΓÇÖs troubleΓÇª
 Guys! LetΓÇÖs take a break here for the time being!
 Pursuers from the Land of Greens?
 They said thatΓÇª
 The ones they were looking for were headed in this direction.
 But why would Ninja be after this group?
 These people are just merchants, arenΓÇÖt they?
 And theyΓÇÖre not even people from the Land of Greens to begin withΓÇª
 Now that you mention it, thatΓÇÖs right.
 But what will we do?
 WeΓÇÖre going to engage them if they come, of course.
 That might be impossibleΓÇª
 We have elderly people and children with us.
 YouΓÇÖre rightΓÇª
 I know.
 It could be that theyΓÇÖre not chasing after us!
 What do you mean by that?
 Basically, weΓÇÖre moving in the same direction as their true target
 and we could just be in their battle groundΓÇªor something.
 I see.
 That means if we clear the path, theyΓÇÖll let us go right by.
 Alright.
 Listen up, guys!
 Some kind of troublesome guys are heading this way.
 Troublesome guys?
 Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxious if you say it like that.
 I-I seeΓÇª
 But you donΓÇÖt need to worry.
 TheyΓÇÖre probably not after usΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll kind of be the long way around,
 but weΓÇÖll make it through if we take a little side turn up ahead.
 Does this feudal lord really have this little?
 HeΓÇÖs a feudal lord whoΓÇÖs a prestigious ruler of virtue.
 So he would never line his pockets.
 But weΓÇÖll squeeze out a big pile from now on.
 More importantly, has the young girl in question been found?
 NopeΓÇª
 But the two who were tracking her got attacked.
 We know the direction she fled in.
 That young girl just would not be good.
 If they get away, they may return with forces from other lands.
 If the sun were a little stronger,
 I could burned down a whole mountain with my JutsuΓÇª
 Then IΓÇÖll goΓÇª
 Lord Renga, I gathered all collaborators in the hall as you orderedΓÇª
 Oh, good work.
 Without your guysΓÇÖ help, we couldnΓÇÖt have brought down the castle this easily ΓÇª
 Then brother, shall we go for the hall greeting?
 OkayΓÇª IΓÇÖll take care of things here.
 So, about the thing you promisedΓÇª
 Oh, thatΓÇÖs right.
 Take as much there as you like.
 Really?
 Honestly. ItΓÇÖs so easy to deceive softhearted peopleΓÇª
 It really is exactly so.
 Our lord believed in us until the very endΓÇª
 Come on.
 If you stuff that much in there, the ferry on deathΓÇÖs river will sink.
 I make it a habit not to believe in people.

 ItΓÇÖs no joke.
 C-Could it be that you had me gather the collaborators in the coup toΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre also softhearted!
 That should do it.
 Yurinojou, it seems theyΓÇÖre after us.
 Yes.
 I leave Lady Haruna to you.
 What are you going to do?
 If we wait here for their attack, there will be too many to defend.
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, IΓÇÖll slow them down.
 But according to the information,
 they are three Janin who use unknown Jutsu.
 I know.
 But my Jutsu will not be defeated by the likes of them.
 Very well.
 Go, Kikunojou.
 Yes, Lady Haruna.
 Naruto.
 I set a trap for the time being.
 Jeez, Hinata. YouΓÇÖre such a worrywart.
 You donΓÇÖt need to go that far.
 Huh? Yurinoshin, whereΓÇÖs Kikusuke?
 YouΓÇÖre right. 					Since whenΓÇª?
 Oh, he had some other business and went on aheadΓÇª
 Say what? Taking liberties like that is really a problemΓÇª
 Oh, I see.
 So thatΓÇÖs it, huh?
 What is it?
 Even Kikusuke makes sure to go to the bathroom.
 NarutoΓÇª!
 Lady Haruna, I shall protect you  with my life!
 There!
 WhoΓÇÖre youΓÇª?!
 IΓÇÖm Ruiga.
 To think youΓÇÖd just come right on out nonchalantly.
 Then she must in that group, right?
 If itΓÇÖs one against one, I wonΓÇÖt lose to a hired Ninja like you!
 Can you do it?

 Eat this! Flower Shuriken! Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage!
 Too easyΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt know about that!
 Flower Ninja Art: Release! Myriad of Flowers!
 Ninja Art: Mirror Flower Water Moon!
 Flowers made of Letter Bombs, huh? Futile, futile!
 And Genjutsu next, huh?
 This is the finishing blow.
 Flower Ninja Art: Bloom! Myriad of Flowers!
 Too bad.
 The Ninjutsu of a Flower Ninja canΓÇÖt beat me.
 Now itΓÇÖs my turn!
 Eat this.

 YesterdayΓÇÖs Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one anotherΓÇÖs back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 A running-ramen strategy, huh?
 In other words, we split up in order to avoid annihilation, right?
 With this, the protection burden will decrease.
 But wonΓÇÖt the soup spill if it runs?
 This is an example.
 ItΓÇÖd still be trouble even if itΓÇÖs just an example, believe it.
 Then, letΓÇÖs make it the running-ramen-with-a-lid strategy.
 If you say so, Naruto.
 I mean, do you really understand the strategy, Naruto?

 Shut up!
 He loved the Land of Birds with all his mightΓÇª
 Chishima, who staked his life trying to protect the country he lovedΓÇª
 I will notΓÇªforgive you, no matter what!
 You may say that you wonΓÇÖt forgive me,

 If we follow thisΓÇª
 Yes, we should be able to reach Naruto.
 Unfortunately, I cannot allow you to avenge the blood of the fallen.
 The least I can do for you, out of charity,
 is send you to the same place your father and brother are.
 I donΓÇÖt care.
 Why donΓÇÖt you just kill me in one stroke?
 You know when to give up, huh?
 TheyΓÇÖre all dead. IΓÇÖm the only one left in this world.
 Now that I am unable to take revenge,
 I have no more reason to live.
 YouΓÇÖre a courageous girl, arenΓÇÖt you?
 All right, IΓÇÖll grant your wish.
 Resign yourself!
 Wake up.
 Save TokiΓÇª Save my little sisterΓÇª
 I entrusted the future of the Land of Birds to my younger sister
 and gave her the watch.
 But Toki became obsessed with her desire for revenge.
 I, a dead soul, cannot change my younger sisterΓÇÖs heart
 which is stalled in time.
 IΓÇÖm begging you,
 please make my younger sisterΓÇÖs time begin to move again towards the future.
 What was that just now?
 Die!
 What?
 Hold it!
 What?
 Hold it!
 Naruto!
 I met your elder brother in a dream a little while ago.
 Elder Brother?
 It wasnΓÇÖt the wish of your elder brother Sagi
 that you avenge his death.
 He wanted to leave the care of this land in your hands.
 ButΓÇª
 For ChishimaΓÇÖs sake tooΓÇª
 you must make this Land of Bird a great countryΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why you must live, TokiΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 It doesnΓÇÖt make any difference to me.
 The two of you are going to die here in any case.
 Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?
 WhatΓÇª
 But a person with an impure heart, with a heart bent on revenge,
 cannot govern this land.
 The reason this was such a wonderful country was because
 Chishima and Sagi and TokiΓÇÖs hearts were all connected.
 Even if you use dirty tricks to gain status,
 you will never be able to control the hearts of the peopleΓÇª
 Speak for yourself, squirt!

 IΓÇÖm so relieved!
 Thank you, Naruto!
 I was just carrying out my mission.
 More importantlyΓÇª
 Make that guy pay dearly for his crimes, okay.
 Yes.
 IΓÇÖm sure that Sagi is happy about this too.
 You metΓÇªyou met Elder Brother SagiΓÇª
 Yeah, in a dream.
 But even if it was in a dream,
 it doesnΓÇÖt change the fact that he asked me to do something.
 What did Elder Brother say to you?
 Well, he said something about starting up your time again.
 My time?
 He said he wanted you to forget about things like revenge
 and instead live for the future.

 YeahΓÇª And Toki was finally able to break the curse of seeking revengeΓÇª
 Hey, itΓÇÖs gonna start!
 Down on your knees!
 OhhhΓÇªwowΓÇª
 I must apologize for having deceived everyone
 by using my brotherΓÇÖs name fraudulently,
 and claiming the title of feudal lord.
 In a case such as this,
 it may well be proper to hand over the title of feudal lord to someone else.
 However, if you will forgive me,
 I would like to ask you to allow me to work
 on behalf of Land of Birds as your lord.

 And for my dear friend Chishima who loves this country so dearlyΓÇª

 I would like to work positively to rebuild this country.

 It appears that you all agree too, correct?
 ΓÇô Yes, sir! 					ΓÇô Yes, sir!

 Please take the best of care along the road now.
 Fare thee well.
 Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?

 Please come back to visit again soon.
 Sure, next time IΓÇÖd love to visit without a mission.
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye. Be wellΓÇª
 See youΓÇª
 TokiΓÇªshe was really kind and gorgeous too, wasnΓÇÖt she?
 IΓÇÖm certain that the Land of Birds will become a wonderful land again,
 just like it was in the old days.
 Yeah.
 By the way, NarutoΓÇª did you really meet SagiΓÇÖs ghost?
 You gotta be kidding.
 ThereΓÇÖs no such things as ghostsΓÇª that was all in a dream.
 IΓÇÖm not so sure it was just a dream.
 Wh-What the heck are you talking about?!
 Do you remember that Cursed Warrior we cornered the very first time?
 Uh, yeah.
 Yeah, he was empty inside.
 Th-ThisΓÇª?
 The inside of it is empty.
 Yeah, but that was just sort of gimmick, right?
 Some kind of string or piece of wire or somethingΓÇª
 No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.
 Now that you mention it,
 you said there was no sign of life, right, Neji?
 YeahΓÇªI didnΓÇÖt feel a speck of life from that Cursed Warrior.
 In other words, there was a ghost there.
 So that was a real ghost, after all?!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 That's not trueΓÇª That's not true!
 Tell me thatΓÇÖs not true!
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.

 This stickiness is probably made
 by mixing Chakra with his special body fluid.

 What a lucky guy.
 Next, IΓÇÖll do two at a time. The odds are 2 to 1.

 Turns out he made it to the last.
 Well, it was fun as a game, but now the gameΓÇÖs over.
 Die!
 The first one is done.
 What?!
 I see, the real body made its shadow clones get caught,
 and hid himself and waited for a chance, huh.
 For a small fish like that to make such a plan in those circumstances...
 You're not too badΓÇªbut ΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre at the end of the line. Die!
 What?!
 Naruto, your stall was helpful.

 YouΓÇª HowΓÇª?!

 ItΓÇÖs meaningless in front of Gentle Fist

 Evidently IΓÇÖm the only one who can fight it.
 Go!
 IΓÇÖll take care of this.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong? Hey, Akamaru.
 Apparently, this guyΓÇÖs stronger than the fatso before.
 Quite a bit stronger.
 If weΓÇÖre not prepared for ΓÇ£one person, one kill,ΓÇ¥
 then itΓÇÖs not going to work out.
 ThatΓÇÖs what you said earlier.
 Yeah, thatΓÇÖs right.
 Plus, we wonΓÇÖt be able to catch up with Sasuke if we stall here.
 Choji hasnΓÇÖt come back either.
 The reason weΓÇÖre doing this
 is because of the mission to bring back Sasuke.
 But thatΓÇÖs not all.
 What we are after and trying to protect is the bond
 of the Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Do you remember IrukaΓÇÖs words at the Third HokageΓÇÖs funeral?
 Iruka Sensei, why do people risk their lives for others?
 When someone dies,
 they depart with their past, present and future.
 Many people die on missions or at war.
 And their death is surprisingly unceremoniousΓÇªthey simply die.
 Hayate was one of those people.
 Those who die have dreams and goals, tooΓÇª
 But everyone has things that are equally important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers, the people of their village,
 the people important to you.
 The connection to the people you trust and help mutually,
 the people important to you from the day you were born.
 And the thread that connects you and your people
 gets stronger through time.
 ItΓÇÖs not a theory.
 ThatΓÇÖs what a person does as the thread is established
 because theyΓÇÖre important to youΓÇª
 Look, Sasuke is heading towards Orochimaru.
 We canΓÇÖt let Orochimaru get a hold of someone from our village.
 Absolutely not.
 AndΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 Your eyes are better than mine.
 Right now, Sasuke isΓÇª
 in the darkness.
 Hurry up and go! IΓÇÖll catch up with you all!
 Gotcha!
 Okay! LetΓÇÖs go!
 You along with Choji, be sure to catch up!
 YeahΓÇª
 Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up!
 HehΓÇªthink IΓÇÖll let them get away?!
 Byakugan!
 Here it comes!
 This guyΓÇÖs pretty goodΓÇª
 Neji!
 ThatΓÇÖs Neji all right!
 Not yetΓÇª I wonΓÇÖt let you escape that easily!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you go any further from here!
 ItΓÇÖs useless.
 Well, thatΓÇÖs fine.
 It seems youΓÇÖre the strongest out of the lot.
 Aw man, now I wanna playΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs such a waste if a game isn't played little by little.
 For starters, IΓÇÖll play and kill you in three minutes.
 I got you.
 YouΓÇÖre pretty good at handling Chakra and youΓÇÖve got sharp eyes.
 You release Chakra from the Chakra points in your hands
 like a sharp needle.
 You see the thin part of the thread with Chakra running through it, and attack.
 I see, IΓÇÖve heard from Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 This is whatΓÇÖs called Gentle Fist, isnΓÇÖt it?
 But if you canΓÇÖt use those annoying hands,
 they canΓÇÖt cut my threads either.
 Man, games. The instant you know the rules of engagement,
 theyΓÇÖre no longer interesting.
 ItΓÇÖs only been a minute, but IΓÇÖm already tired of you.
 Die!
 Ninja Art: Gum Style Spider Thread
 What?!
 How did heΓÇª?!
 IΓÇÖll explain, specially to you.
 ItΓÇÖs not just my hands
 I can release Chakra from all of the Chakra points on my body.
 And itΓÇÖs game over.
 Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain

 The attack on his Chakra points is ineffective.
 On top of that,
 he switched to a long-distance attack to avoid Gentle Fist.
 This guy blocks my every move and he quickly reads my hands.
 This is bad. IΓÇÖm at a disadvantage if the fight drags on.

 asking her to let him go off in search of Sasuke.
 So she sneaked out of her office, butΓÇª
 He was lying in wait for her here.
 NarutoΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve asked you numerous times already!
 Please let me go in search of Sasuke!
 IΓÇÖve told you numerous times already. lmpossible!
 Why!
 You have some training to do!
 I canΓÇÖt because Pervy Sage isnΓÇÖt around!
 We have zero leads on either Orochimaru and Sasuke.
 So how are you planning to search for him?
 I can figure it out somehow!
 If there arenΓÇÖt any leads, IΓÇÖll go find some!
 So please let me go do it!
 YouΓÇÖre stubborn, aren't you?
 YouΓÇÖre stubborn too, Old Lady Tsunade!
 ΓÇô Please let me go! ΓÇô No, you may not!
 If I say IΓÇÖm going, IΓÇÖm going!
 Shut up! No means no!
 Byakugan!
 All right! Good work, Neji!
 Move in another half step right there!
 Yes sir!
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 LetΓÇÖs take a break, Neji.
 Yes.
 Have some tea too.
 Thank youΓÇª
 If Hinata was here, she should have observed a little.
 Hinata prepared thisΓÇª?
 It would supplement her training by observingΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 LetΓÇÖs take a break.
 Yes.
 Food! Food!
 That was pretty well done.
 I would say that youΓÇÖre getting closer to perfecting the technique.
 ItΓÇÖs thanks to you both.
 YouΓÇÖre so kind to join me in my special training every dayΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre a team.
 When a comrade in the team is in a fix,
 one offers a helping hand.
 ThatΓÇÖs only naturalΓÇª
 A comradeΓÇª
 If a comrade suddenly disappears,
 it must be awfully hard.
 YouΓÇÖre talking about Naruto, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Isn't there some way we could help him?
 IΓÇÖd like to help him out in some way tooΓÇªbutΓÇª
 Lady Hokage was telling NarutoΓÇª
 that there are no leads at all.
 There may be one resourceΓÇª
 Really?!
 IΓÇÖm talking about Bikochu.
 Bikochu?
 Are you talking about those rare insectsΓÇª?!
 I have heard that they had become extinct some time ago.
 Since there was a possibility that they could become extinct,
 the Aburame Clan discontinued using them,
 so a miniscule number of them should still be alive.
 Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu?
 WellΓÇªitΓÇÖs not surprising that you donΓÇÖt know about them.
 The last time that Bikochu were used
 was before the last Great WarΓÇª
 Bikochu are one kind of insect used by insect handlers.
 Larvae which have hatched from eggs become chrysalises in no time at all,
 then emerge and turn into imagos.
 They are then made to recognize scentsΓÇª
 and they are able to track even the faintest scentΓÇª
 to its source.
 Their olfactory sense is several thousand times greater than a Ninja Hound's.
 They are insects capable of exhibiting that skill in an exceptional way.
 However, Bikochu lay eggs only once every several yearsΓÇª
 This year is actually the year in which they lay eggs.
 And right now is exactly the time when they hatch.
 I see.
 There are still some of SasukeΓÇÖs belongings left in the villageΓÇª
 Right?
 If one makes the Bikochu, recognize that scentΓÇª
 We may be able to locate SasukeΓÇÖs whereabouts, right?
 What is the probability of finding a Bikochu?
 Frankly speaking, not very high. Perhaps 10%.
 10% huhΓÇª
 As you guys know,
 the situation in the village is currently very graveΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt have the leeway of allowing even Genin to sit around and play.
 However, fortunately or unfortunately, Kurenai has been hospitalized,
 so you guys, Squad Eight, no longer have a mission.
 Rather than just letting you sit around and play,
 IΓÇÖd rather place my bet on that 10% possibility.
 HuhΓÇª you meanΓÇª
 Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka. Hinata Hyuga.
 I order you to search for the Bikochu!
 ΓÇô All right! 					ΓÇô All right!
 I designate Shino as the leader this time.
 AndΓÇªthat spy up there!
 OwwΓÇª!
 NarutoΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre going to go even if I try to stop you, right?
 Yup!
 In that case, I have no choice but to let you goΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 This is your last chance.
 If you donΓÇÖt find the BikochuΓÇª
 you must give up on Sasuke!
 Wha--?
 You understand?!
 ItΓÇÖll be fineΓÇª IΓÇÖll find it without fail.
 All right. You wonΓÇÖt go back on your word, right?
 Yeah! Leave it to me!
 YouΓÇÖre easily pleased, arenΓÇÖt you?
 Owww!
 NarutoΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Hinata.
 Good morning.
 Neji will be here soon for his trainingΓÇª
 Please prepare tea as always.
 WellΓÇª
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 I need to goΓÇª on a mission starting nowΓÇª
 A mission, huhΓÇª
 In that case, it canΓÇÖt be helpedΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm heading outΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt be a burden to the others.
 Yes, sir!
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªIΓÇÖm sorry! IΓÇÖm in a hurryΓÇª
 The way she handled her physical response just nowΓÇª
 HinataΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre late, Hinata!
 IΓÇÖm sorry!
 All right then! LetΓÇÖs head out!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Huh?
 Why are you walking at such a leisurely pace?!
 It takes a Shinobi two days on foot
 to get to the habitat of the Bikochu ΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to make haste from the very start.
 But what if the eggs hatch before we get there?
 The eggs of Bikochu only hatch on the day after itΓÇÖs rainedΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no sign of it raining any time soonΓÇª
 ButΓÇªif by some remote chanceΓÇª
 Naruto.
 Wh-What is it?
 I am the leader of this team.
 While we are on this mission, you will obey the orders of your leader.
 Kiba, I canΓÇÖt believe youΓÇÖre able to work with that kind of guyΓÇª
 Well, IΓÇÖve gotten used to itΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sure youΓÇÖll bond with him too, Naruto.
 I wonder about thatΓÇª
 Naruto and the others left a while ago.
 I see.
 DidnΓÇÖt you want to go too?
 When it comes to searching for insects,
 Shino, whoΓÇÖs an insect handler, is number oneΓÇª
 And then Hinata who has ByakuganΓÇª
 and Kiba and Akamaru who have sensitive noses are there tooΓÇª
 So thereΓÇÖs really no role that I could play!
 What I must do right nowΓÇª
 is to become a Medical Ninja as soon as I possibly can!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Shino?!
 The sunΓÇÖs going down. WeΓÇÖre setting up camp.
 Got it.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Okay.
 Huh? WhatΓÇª?!
 WeΓÇÖre gonna set up camp already?!
 IΓÇÖm not tired at all yet! LetΓÇÖs go further!
 Naruto, the leader of this team is me.
 I-I understand!
 Okay thenΓÇªletΓÇÖs sleep.
 HuhΓÇªweΓÇÖre gonna sleep already?!
 Many animals and plants go to sleep at sunset
 and awake at sunrise.
 In order to search for insects,
 we must understand the rhythm of living creatures with our own bodiesΓÇª
 ButΓÇªthe sunΓÇÖs just setΓÇª
 Naruto, I am the leader of this teamΓÇª
 Okay, okay. I got it!
 ThereΓÇÖs no way I can sleep so earlyΓÇª
 Yeah, rightΓÇª
 All that complaining and guess who's the first one to fall asleep?
 I have to peeΓÇª
 Huh?
 Huh?
 WhatΓÇÖs that?
 ItΓÇÖs a waterfallΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª Is somebody there?
 S-SayΓÇª
 Damn itΓÇª!
 S-Sorry. Did I scare you?
 Huh?
 ThereΓÇÖs nobody thereΓÇª
 Huh, NarutoΓÇª Did you catch a cold?
 YeahΓÇªa littleΓÇª
 After sleeping so much youΓÇÖre still tired?
 Well, uhΓÇª
 When I woke up last night to pee, I saw something awesomeΓÇª
 Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?
 No, IΓÇÖm okayΓÇª
 AndΓÇªwhat was that awesome thing?
 It was a beautiful woman in the middle of the waterfall!
 Huh?
 When that person moved her arms, the water would suddenly move too!
 It was awesome!
 And what happened thenΓÇª
 When I tried to speak to her, she suddenly vanished.
 You must have been dreaming or something.
 It's starting to feel that wayΓÇª
 You idiot!
 Your face is red, Hinata.
 You might have really caught a cold.
 HuhΓÇªreally, IΓÇÖm fineΓÇª
 This fruit is edible. This will be our meal today.
 Got it.
 We can save on our food supplies too.
 ThereΓÇÖs one thing I need to warn you about.
 On rare occasions, this fruit grows to the size of a human being.
 However, those fruits are damaged inside.
 DonΓÇÖt tamper with them under any circumstance.
 ThereΓÇÖs nobody who would eat something that huge.
 N-NarutoΓÇª!
 HeΓÇÖs eating itΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª WeΓÇÖre going on aheadΓÇª
 IΓÇÖllΓÇªIΓÇÖll be right behind you!
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 Wait just a second!
 HeyΓÇªarenΓÇÖt we there yet?
 Yes.
 We're here!
 WhatΓÇª?
 Wow!
 IΓÇÖve never seen anything like this before.
 This certainly isnΓÇÖt a place where humans could inhabit.
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs why itΓÇÖs paradise for insects.
 D-DonΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª
 Could it be thatΓÇªover thereΓÇª?
 You mean thatΓÇÖs where the Bikochu are?
 No problem. ltΓÇÖs better than the Chunin Exam.
 DamnΓÇªThe foothold crumbles easilyΓÇª
 ΓÇô NarutoΓÇª 					ΓÇô What?
 As the leader, IΓÇÖm warning youΓÇª
 At a time like this, what is it?!
 DonΓÇÖt fall.
 I already know that without your telling me!
 Naruto!
 No wayΓÇª!
 That was closeΓÇª
 Those were insects, huhΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why I warned you.
 When this mission is over,
 IΓÇÖm definitely gonna kick that guyΓÇÖs butt!
 This isΓÇªthe Bikochu forest.
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 ThereΓÇÖs no mistake. Those are Leaf Shinobi.
 The fact that those guys came to a place like this
 means their objective isΓÇª
 YeahΓÇªitΓÇÖs the same as oursΓÇª the Bikochu.
 WeΓÇÖre not gonna let them take any Bikochu.
 The Bikochu, ΓÇª belong to us, the Kamizuru Clan!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you donΓÇÖt answer
 YouΓÇÖre crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   IΓÇÖm crying too
 ΓÇ£Let my lonely scream ring out through the nightΓÇ¥
 IΓÇÖll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And IΓÇÖll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 IΓÇÖll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, IΓÇÖll kick their butt   Yeah
 Huh! If youΓÇÖre talking about the insect in this photograph,
 IΓÇÖm very familiar with it.
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Really?!
 DamnΓÇªDonΓÇÖt tell me that was a Bikochu?
 Where did you see it?
 I heard some rustling in the kitchen in the middle of the night,
 and I unintentionally threw a slipper at itΓÇª
 Wait a secondΓÇª
 N-NarutoΓÇª
 What youΓÇÖre talking about is an ordinary cockroach.

 Huh?
 One more, you said, ehΓÇª?
 Just when I thought youΓÇÖd snuck out of your hospital room
 and were doing some trainingΓÇª
 You guys want some, too?
 Pop, here's the tab.
 Thanks for your business!
 Jeez, IΓÇÖm fine!
 Naruto, even if it looks like youΓÇÖve healed on the surface, youΓÇÖre still battered.
 ItΓÇÖs not like that! I have to train and get stronger!
 Yeah-yeah, after youΓÇÖve healed completely.
 Damn it! I have to keep my promise to Sakura without further delayΓÇª!
 SakuraΓÇª YouΓÇÖre so pathetic.
 NarutoΓÇªThis is aΓÇª once in a lifetime request...
 Please bringΓÇª please bring Sasuke back.
 I couldnΓÇÖt do it! I wasnΓÇÖt able to stop Sasuke!
 At this point, the only person who would be able to stop SasukeΓÇª
 who would be able to save himΓÇª
 Is youΓÇªNarutoΓÇª
 All I didΓÇªwas cryΓÇª All I did was totally rely on Naruto.
 I didnΓÇÖt do anything myself.
 Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke even if it meant his lifeΓÇª
 What can I do for Sasuke nowΓÇª?
 I just have to put my life on the line and do it!
 ItΓÇÖs futile. The ropes are made of a maidenΓÇÖs black hair.
 And the knot is a Shinobi reverse butterfly knot.
 It wonΓÇÖt be easily untied.
 Give me a break.
 I have to start training as soon as possible and get stronger.
 Then do as the Medical Corps says and rest quietly.
 Come in.
 OhΓÇª
 Sorry, SakuraΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd like to get moving immediately if possible, butΓÇª
 He has astonishing recuperative power, but overdoing it is a big no-no.
 IΓÇÖm okay!
 Be a little more patient!
 Just wait a little longer! IΓÇÖll keep my promise, no matter what!
 NoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okayΓÇª
 Up until now, I was totally reliant on youΓÇª
 and I did nothing, soΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter, SakuraΓÇª?
 Did something happen?!
 NoΓÇª I'm was relieved to see you doing well.
 This time, IΓÇÖll do my best.
 SakuraΓÇª?
 I heard you snuck out of the hospital.
 Do you want to train that badly?
 Pervy SageΓÇª? MyΓÇªapple!
 Well well, things look like theyΓÇÖre going smoothly.
 Don't you worry. IΓÇÖll train you hard right away.
 UmmΓÇªabout the training.
 I was wondering if you could wait a little while longer.
 Hmm?
 IΓÇÖm not saying I donΓÇÖt want to train.
 But I remembered some odds and ends I need to take care of.
 Oh?
 Odds and ends, huh?
 Come on. Please?
 Come in!
 Oh, IΓÇÖve been spotted, huh?
 IΓÇÖm guessing, you want to peep?
 No matter how long you wait, I wonΓÇÖt show anything.
 Wh-WhoΓÇÖd peep at an old lady?!
 N-No, I take that back!
 Actually, IΓÇÖve come to make an earnest request to you as the Hokage.
 Talk.
 This time, IΓÇÖll do my best.
 It couldnΓÇÖt be that SakuraΓÇÖs going toΓÇª
 This might beΓÇªmy last lookΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª
 How did youΓÇª?
 I know what youΓÇÖre thinking!
 That thereΓÇÖd be nothing I could do even if I were to goΓÇª!
 But I hate myself just standing here doing nothing!
 Always being a hindrance to and taking advantage of everyoneΓÇª
 Not being able to do one single thing respectablyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs useless to stop me!
 I wonΓÇÖt stop youΓÇª
 You should do it until youΓÇÖre satisfied.
 ButΓÇªIΓÇÖm going, too.
 ButΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs become just the two of usΓÇª
 But weΓÇÖre a three-man squad, right?
 Yeah.
 You guysΓÇª
 Oops! Pervy Sage?
 This personΓÇªis Jiraiya, one of the legendary Sannin?
 If you, without permission,
 go out past the border of the Village Hidden in the Leaves...
 you know at least that youΓÇÖll be sent to prison as Rogue Ninja, right?
 ItΓÇÖs no use stopping us!
 I wonΓÇÖt stop you.
 YouΓÇÖve been given a mission by Lady Hokage.
 YouΓÇÖre to investigate and report on the Land of Rice Paddies
 where the Village Hidden in Sound is and where Sasuke has been taken away.
 The mission is set to be carried out in a group of three.
 As of now, you will work under me. You got a problem?!
 It seems theyΓÇÖre the biggest of fools.
 They wonΓÇÖt stop even if you tried.
 At this rate, weΓÇÖll lose two important subordinates!
 YouΓÇÖll recognize it as a special mission
 with the goal of investigating the Village Hidden in Sound, right?
 I have no choice, huhΓÇª?
 But I have a condition.
 Bring the two back alive. Got it?
 Sure, even if it costs my life.
 ItΓÇÖs too dangerous of a mission even with that Jiraiya going with themΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the Land of Rice Paddies where the Village Hidden in the Sound is.
 ItΓÇÖs that OrochimaruΓÇÖs headquarters.
 Take sufficient caution and proceed.
 ItΓÇÖs kind of anticlimacticΓÇª
 Here I thought a bunch of OrochimaruΓÇÖs followers would greet us!
 Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?
 It seems to be a peaceful, quiet and nice land, butΓÇª
 No, we still havenΓÇÖt entered Village Hidden in the Sound.
 This is the Land of Rice Paddies.
 Land of Rice Paddies?
 ItΓÇÖs a small land thatΓÇÖs nothing special.
 The feudal lord was a foolish lord who hungered for powerful military strength
 in order to make the land disproportionately larger.
 And then Orochimaru probably won favor with some fast-talkingΓÇª
 Of course, Orochimaru himself wasnΓÇÖt thinking about making the land stronger.
 He just had an ambition to make himself stronger and to carry out revengeΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why thereΓÇÖs nothing in this area that points to his presence.
 Really? And so, Pervy SageΓÇª!
 DonΓÇÖt call me Pervy Sage!
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª HeΓÇÖs one of the legendary Sannin, soΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs just a lady-loving perverted Pervy Sage!
 What?!
 More importantly, whereΓÇÖs the Village Hidden in the Sound?
 Beats meΓÇª I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 What?!
 We donΓÇÖt know where it is, so weΓÇÖre going to investigate, right?
 YouΓÇÖve got a point, butΓÇª
 But how do we find it?
 There canΓÇÖt be a place where people are without food and ladies.
 People gather where thereΓÇÖs food and girls!
 ΓÇô Where people gather, there's news. ΓÇô There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.
 HeΓÇÖs planning to sow his wild oats under the guise of a special mission.
 First off, finding a travelerΓÇÖs town with lots of hot ladies is the top priority!
 Every land should have a travelerΓÇÖs town.
 Lodging
 This is a travelerΓÇÖs townΓÇªright?
 Looks like nobodyΓÇÖs living here anymore.
 No, I feel the presence of peopleΓÇª
 And the smell of face powder!
 ΓÇô Naruto, take it out. ΓÇô Take what out?
 DonΓÇÖt act as you donΓÇÖt know!
 In anything one does, a war chest is necessary, right?
 What! Are you after my wallet? Man!
 What?! This shouldnΓÇÖt be it! Try jumping!
 Huh?!
 No! Stop!
 One, two, threeΓÇª Is this all you got?
 ThatΓÇÖs all of it, really!
 ΓÇô HereΓÇª 					ΓÇô Huh?
 ItΓÇÖs not much, but please use it.
 No! Sakura, thereΓÇÖs no need for you to give that to him!
 But, itΓÇÖs money for gathering information, right?
 Right-right. This should be enough.
 You guys go on ahead to the outskirts of the post station and wait!
 Wh-Why?
 ItΓÇÖs too dangerous ahead from here. ltΓÇÖs a mission for adults.
 Hmm, the smell of face powderΓÇÖs from here.
 WelcomeΓÇª
 Along came a sucker just begging to be parted from his money.
 We should be able to pulverize him.
 Food and Drink! And young women!
 Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,
 heΓÇÖs just going to sow his oats without gathering any information, anyway.
 Sow his oatsΓÇª?
 Y-YeahΓÇª I donΓÇÖt really know about it, butΓÇª
 You know, make-out blah-blah-blahΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs fine! lf I can be of at least some helpΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm always a hindrance who canΓÇÖt do anything, soΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not like that!
 In the first place, if you hadnΓÇÖt taken the actionΓÇª
 IΓÇÖd still be tied to the bed!
 Brothel
 Even in different lands, there are young women everywhere.
 So? Why donΓÇÖt we move to the room in the back?
 I want to talk more relaxed.
 Nice, nice.
 Then first, settle up the tab for here, okay?
 What, am I already drunk on this cheap drinkΓÇª?
 ArenΓÇÖt there like three too many zeros?
 You like to joke, do you?
 If you value your life, leave all youΓÇÖve got on you here.
 I see how it is.
 Master JiraiyaΓÇÖs late.
 IΓÇÖm sick of waiting.
 Naruto!
 WhoΓÇÖs there?!
 WhoΓÇÖre you?! Are you one of OrochimaruΓÇÖs followers?!
 What? Was I wrong?!
 Damn it.
 That kid had erased his presence until heΓÇÖd gotten that close.
 I wonΓÇÖt let him get away!
 DonΓÇÖt move!
 Wh-Why?!
 Makibishi Spikes!
 Naruto!
 Wh-What?!
 ΓÇô Hold it! You jerk! ΓÇô We wonΓÇÖt let you get away!
 Naruto, whatΓÇÖs that?!
 Pervy Sage? What did you do?!
 IΓÇÖll tell you later! Anyway, letΓÇÖs get out of here!
 Why?!
 Companions of the person just now?
 If theyΓÇÖre OrochimaruΓÇÖs followers, with my Shadow Clone Jutsu, IΓÇÖllΓÇª
 No, no! DonΓÇÖt get the wrong idea!
 TheyΓÇÖre just bodyguards from a rip-off bar!
 R-Rip-off barΓÇª?!
 First and foremost, this mission has to be carried out in strict secrecy!
 ThereΓÇÖd be no point if you were to use Ninja Art and stand out!
 You! Carry the bags!
 The one whoΓÇÖs totally standing out is you, Pervy Sage!
 You have a point.
 This is wrong! Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 Jeez, this is an appallingly unsettled town.
 Well, you guys wait here.
 Huh? Why?!
 Infiltrating up ahead is too dangerous!
 ItΓÇÖs too much for you youngsters.
 Pervy SageΓÇª
 I myself should be the only sacrifice! See ya, Naruto.
 Blah-blah-blah, trying to look goodΓÇª
 Your scheme to go into a weird shop again is totally obvious!

 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Hmm, what?
 A wanted flyer.
 ""This man who calls himself Tokichi is a major criminal
 who has killed a family of threeΓÇª""
 ""He has a bird-shaped birthmark on his chest.""
 A bird-shaped birthmarkΓÇª? lt couldnΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 What is it, Hinata?
 I canΓÇÖt tell because his face is covered with scars.
 But he hasΓÇªa bird-shaped birthmark.
 He has a bounty on his head too?
 What the heck is going on with everything?
 Hunt or Be Hunted?!                      Showdown at the OK Temple
 Where are you going, old man?
 Just rest quietly.
 Let go!
 Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mineΓÇª
 What the heck can you do in that condition, you wanted man?!

 WhatΓÇÖs the idea of a bounty chasing after a bounty?
 ItΓÇÖs none of your concern!
 Your wound againΓÇª
 Stop!
 D-DonΓÇÖt move!
 I didnΓÇÖt do itΓÇª
 Then, how do you explain this wanted flyer?
 That Gosunkugi did itΓÇª
 He killed an innocent family of threeΓÇª
 just to steal money.
 What do you mean by that?
 I was a swordsmith in a tiny villageΓÇª
 in a small country sandwiched between two large countries.
 I was poor, but for me it was a happy life.
 But on that festival dayΓÇª
 I was about to go deliver a sword that a customer had ordered.
 I wanted to participate in the festival right away, so I was hurrying.
 At that very momentΓÇª
 For some reason, the door was half open.
 ItΓÇÖs TokichiΓÇª IΓÇÖm delivering the sword you orderedΓÇª
 I told everyone everything as it happened.
 ButΓÇªthe people in the village wouldnΓÇÖt believe me.
 ItΓÇÖs because I was the only one who hadnΓÇÖt shown up at the festival.
 And the particular shape of the sword that stabbed through the familyΓÇª
 A swordsmith should be able to make any kind of weaponΓÇª
 That was the reason.
 Stand up, Tokichi!
 Tokichi!
 DonΓÇÖt let him get away! After him!
 And ever sinceΓÇª
 I wandered aimlessly from town to town.
 BOUNTY  One million ryo
 It was something the villagers had issued.
 And there was one more wanted flyer besides mineΓÇª
 BOUNTY 					Threee million yen

 I resolved to capture Gosunkugi with my own hands.
 I would clear my name and return to my villageΓÇª
 AndΓÇªto get some information about him, if even just a littleΓÇª
 I became a bounty hunter despite having a price on my own head.
 So thatΓÇÖs why we were in the way, huh?
 The only way to prove my innocence is for me to capture him myself.
 I want to go home.
 Will youΓÇªconcede him to me?
 WeΓÇÖre Ninja.
 We carry out missions weΓÇÖve received, no matter what!
 Even if the worst were to happen, we canΓÇÖt let him get away.
 LetΓÇÖs goΓÇª
 Was that okay, Naruto?
 That Gosunkugi jerk!
 We have to capture him, no matter what.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 And if that old man, Sazanami, pushes it too far in his condition,
 not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi, he could end up getting killed instead.
 DonΓÇÖt hold back. IΓÇÖll give youΓÇª
 the likes of my head.
 YouΓÇÖre wounded, so I can kill you whenever I want.
 Before that, IΓÇÖll be taking Gosunkugi.
 Well, I guess IΓÇÖll just have those Shinobi kids do their best.
 The Land of Stone, Post Station TwoΓÇª
 It seems everything in this townΓÇª
 politics, economics, military, is conducted by monks.
 It really is. Nothing but templesΓÇª
 The temple, which could be called the head temple,
 is the OK Temple on that mountain.
 Hey, Hinata. WhatΓÇÖs that bell?
 That was created as the sightseeing crown jewel
 to recruit people to live in their templeΓÇª The Golden Bell!
 ItΓÇÖs just like it is saying, ΓÇ£Please steal me.ΓÇ¥
 I knowΓÇª Gosunkugi is after that bell!
 ΓÇô Yeah. 					ΓÇô Yeah.
 But how does that Gosunkugi guy intend to steal that bell?
 Naruto!
 HuhΓÇª?
 You guysΓÇªare GosunkugiΓÇÖsΓÇª!
 Are these guys going to corral us?!
 Just like the time with SazanamiΓÇª
 Byakugan.
 Look out! Run!
 Old Man Sazanami?!
 Leave this to me!
 All right!
 Eat this!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing hereΓÇª?
 I just came to settle the score.
 ButΓÇªyour wound is stillΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt get in your way.
 IΓÇÖll pursue the target on my own. This is a competition!
 I guess it canΓÇÖt be helped. I accept!
 But we canΓÇÖt even start as things stand now!
 There are still nails in the groundΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs waiting for the best moment.
 Gosunkugi!
 The bellΓÇªis at the top!
 WhatΓÇª?! Could it beΓÇª?!
 Oh, noΓÇª!
 The nails in the ground arenΓÇÖt moving.
 The Jutsu has worn off!
 What?!
 Damn it! When did he--?!
 So as the words say, weΓÇÖve been ΓÇ£nailed down,ΓÇ¥ huh?
 They're by the bell!
 Why that--!
 Wait! DonΓÇÖt forget the bounty hunter from last night is also after Gosunkugi!
 No problemΓÇª! WeΓÇÖll get there first, no matter what!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 How awfulΓÇª
 That Gosunkugi jerkΓÇª!
 Unforgivable!
 Hey! WhereΓÇÖs Gosunkugi?!
 Naruto! HeΓÇÖll get away if weΓÇÖre too slow!
 We donΓÇÖt have any time to think. LetΓÇÖs take care of this in one shot!

 If I kill you, the one who can prove my innocence will be gone!
 We loseΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 What?!
 Bounty Sazanami, otherwise known as TokichiΓÇª
 I, Gatsu, have apprehended you!
 And you, bounty Gosunkugi!
 Your spree of evil deedsΓÇª
 The number of charges against you is incalculableΓÇª
 A government official has ordered you hauled in for questioning!
 Old manΓÇª
 Damn it. ThereΓÇÖs nothing we can do if the opposition is a bureaucratΓÇª
 You murderer!
 Give back the family you killed!
 WeΓÇÖll kill you in the same way!
 Damn itΓÇª!
 Hey, hey, you guys!
 YouΓÇÖve got nerve to put up wanted flyers without doing a decent investigation!
 This man is the true culprit behind the murder that occurred in this village!
 This Gosunkugi has already been apprehended and has confessed.
 And the weapon has been seizedΓÇª
 Therefore this individual Tokichi shall be acquitted!
 You jerks! You made me work for free!
 WhatΓÇÖre you going to do about it?!
 WhyΓÇÖd you do that for me?
 I overheard some stupid tale of woe, you see.
 It makes no difference to a bounty hunterΓÇª
 But I overheard it, and so I had no choice.
 It was necessary to verify whether or not you really are a wanted manΓÇª
 YouΓÇª
 Not ΓÇ£you.ΓÇ¥ Gatsu!
 IΓÇÖm also a bounty hunterΓÇª IΓÇÖm in the same trade as you!
 GatsuΓÇª
 TokichiΓÇª WeΓÇÖre sorry.
 Forgive us, Tokichi.
 Good for youΓÇª Old Man Sazanami.
 LetΓÇÖs go.
 IΓÇÖve kind of gotten homesick and really miss the Leaf VillageΓÇª
 But you know, a failed mission means failureΓÇª
 The Fifth HokageΓÇÖs going to scold you good, Naruto.
 What?!
 You failed another mission?!
 IΓÇªdonΓÇÖt want to go homeΓÇª
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Creeping up noisily, a round, fat guy and a skinny one!
 Beneath the scorching rain, a disastrous tranquility ensues.

 Shouting that you are hereΓÇª
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.

 The Powerful Helper
 Old Man GennoΓÇª
 Yes! This is quite good!
 Isn't it?!
 WhyΓÇÖd he do something like this?
 Now this detonator wonΓÇÖt activate.
 Excellent, Tenten.
 Now we can sigh with relief.
 No, itΓÇÖs still too soon to be relieved.
 RightΓÇª When Genno realizes that
 the detonator here has been removedΓÇª
 he might activate the Paper Bombs with
 some other method and blow up the Leaf.
 Oh, right.
 You jerk. DonΓÇÖt scare me like that, Choji!
 Sorry.
 At the moment, it seems thereΓÇÖs no one here
 whoΓÇÖs picked up on our movements.
 All right, then put things back the way they were.
 Got it.
 Now thenΓÇª
 You guys do the Kunai Knife practice like before.
 DonΓÇÖt hit the center.
 We know.
 But we were sure luckyΓÇª Nobody hit the center.
 But I hit it right in the center yesterday.
 I bet you were off by a little.
 What? I donΓÇÖt know about that..
 It hit, I tell you.
 To think thereΓÇÖd be this many.
 Lady Tsunade, letΓÇÖs evacuate the villagers as quickly as possible.
 Hey, youΓÇÖre joking, right?
 What do you mean?
 If you do that, Genno mightΓÇª
 blow up the remaining Paper Bombs
 right under the cover of the evacuation confusion.
 I see.
 Naruto and the others are removing the Paper Bombs now.
 Could you wait for their report?
 Akamaru?
 Did you find one?
 There it is!
 All right!
 Attaboy, Akamaru.
 HowΓÇÖs it coming?
 Just a little more.
 Yes!
 I leave the rest to you.
 Leave it to me.
 Did you get it yet, Naruto?
 Just a little more.
 Just a little more, I tell you.
 H-Hang in there, Naruto.
 Damn it, you littleΓÇª
 Hey, whatΓÇÖre you guys doing?
 Oh, ummΓÇª
 Some money got into the opening.
 Oh, IΓÇÖll get it out for you later.
 No, no. ThatΓÇÖd be dangerousΓÇª
 I mean, thereΓÇÖs no time to waste with eating ramen.
 Th-ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Ichiraku is sure tasty, isnΓÇÖt it? Well, hang in there.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Thanks.
 Phew, we got through it well.
 Excellent, Naruto.
 WeΓÇÖd like more manpower.
 It takes too long just with us.
 But there arenΓÇÖt any other Shinobi left in the village.
 Well, there are some here, though.
 People of leisure who do nothing but tell about old stories and
 complain about what the young people do.
 Huh?
 Could they beΓÇª?
 Did you get that foul mouth from the Third Hokage?
 ItΓÇÖs the job of us advisors to give advice to the youngsters.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong with complaining?
 It seems you have a good nose for village crises due to your longevity.
 YouΓÇÖre plenty older than you look yourself.
 Wh-What did you say? You old bag!
 Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage.
 WeΓÇÖve grasped most of the situation. Where should we head to?
 Then thereΓÇÖs a place IΓÇÖve been saving for you.
 Oh ho. I canΓÇÖt wait.
 To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten.
 ThatΓÇÖs a powerful supporter.
 Wow.
 But scary.
 Hurry! Youth, full power!
 The enemyΓÇÖs in the Leaf!
 I appreciate it, but I canΓÇÖt stand those two.
 But the removal operation will proceed swiftly
 once Guy Senpai and the others who headed for the Hidden Waterfall get back.
 ItΓÇÖll be nice if things were to go conveniently like that, butΓÇª
 Shikamaru, have you got something?
 I mean, itΓÇÖs not ordinary stuff.
 When and how the hell did he set them?
 There are too many Paper Bombs. An abnormal amount of it.
 No doubt about it.
 Uh-huh.
 And thereΓÇÖs one more thing bugging me.
 WeΓÇÖre overlooking something hugeΓÇª I really get that feeling.
 Almost.
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing? YouΓÇÖre not supposed to hit the center.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 IΓÇÖm next. IΓÇÖll miss.
 In your case, youΓÇÖll probably miss even if you aim.
 HowΓÇÖs it going, Neji?
 The Paper Bomb removal operation is going smoothly.
 I donΓÇÖt see anyone resembling Genno either.
 I wonder where the enemy is.
 Making us walk all the way to the outskirts of town.
 She mustΓÇÖve gotten this slave driver tendency from the Third Hokage.
 A place that wouldnΓÇÖt be unusual for old people to tell old stories.
 IΓÇÖll rake her over the coals when we get back.
 But what is that Genno fellow thinking?
 ThereΓÇÖs no point to setting Paper Bombs in a place like this.
 Is that what you really think?
 What?
 There was a plan to build
 a shopping district around here before, right?
 That talk was over thirty years ago.
 Hmm?!
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 H-Hey, isnΓÇÖt thatΓÇª?
 Yes.
 Look at this.
 What is it?
 The Jutsu form written here is different.
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 Now that you mention it, thereΓÇÖs no doubt.
 It looks the same to me, though.
 Where are your eyes pointing?
 ItΓÇÖs the first time IΓÇÖve seen this.
 ItΓÇÖs nothing new to us.
 Speaking of Paper Bombs, thatΓÇÖs what they were in the old days.
 Then this is an old version?
 It seems most of the Paper Bombs
 that have been set in the village are of that type.
 Everyone, please look closely once more
 at the locations where the Paper Bombs were set.
 Although this is a residential area here,
 there are hardly any Paper Bombs set.
 On the other hand, a large number of Paper Bombs
 have been set in places where hardly anyone lives.
 What does that mean?
 In the old plans,
 that was supposed to become a bustling shopping district.
 What? Could that beΓÇª?
 If you think about it putting together various factors
 such as the antique Paper Bombs,
 the places where they were set and suchΓÇª
 This is a trap that was set thirty years ago.
 Thirty years agoΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs just ridiculous. Not one person noticed in thirty years.
 ItΓÇÖs a blind spot.
 Nobody would ever think
 that this many Paper Bombs would be set here in this village.
 Once buried in a wall,
 it couldnΓÇÖt be found unless Byakugan or something was used.
 Then you mean the Genno guy tried to use
 the Paper Bombs someone set thirty years ago?
 But how did he find them?
 Thirty years ago? Could it beΓÇª?!
 Shikamaru, where are you going?
 Hey! Wait up.
 WeΓÇÖre finished here, too
 LetΓÇÖs go to the next spot, Hinata.
 Right.
 Hinata!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 I was using the Byakugan the whole time,
 so IΓÇÖm just a little tiredΓÇª IΓÇÖm fine.
 Are you sure?
 Let me see.
 Oh.
 YouΓÇÖre kind of feverish. Your face is red, too.
 No, itΓÇÖs not like that.
 IΓÇÖll be okay if I just rest a littleΓÇª
 Really? Then IΓÇÖll deliver the Paper Bombs
 weΓÇÖve gathered thus far to Grandma Tsunade,
 so you wait here.
 Okay.
 IΓÇÖll be right back!
 Ichiraku Ramen
 The old man was standing here the first time I met him.
 I thought he was just a ramen-loving old man, butΓÇª
 Hm?
 Could it be that what he was looking at then wasΓÇª?
 Why in a place like this?
 Well wellΓÇª
 So you found it, huh?
 Old man?
 I guess I cannot let you go back now, can I?
 Thirty years ago, huh?
 ThatΓÇÖs around the time when my dad was still the master carpenter.
 It was probably a time
 when many outsiders were hired just like now.
 But I wonder if there are records from back then.
 Anything would be fine. A blueprint or a ledger.
 Hey, Shikamaru. WhatΓÇÖre you talking about? Explain.
 Why did the referral vanish?
 Referral? You mean the real referral
 that became the catalyst for Genno being suspected?
 It was bugging me the whole time.
 Perhaps the disappearance of the referral was GennoΓÇÖs doing.
 But why was it necessary to get rid of it?
 It all makes sense if we consider the referral
 that disappeared was a fake, too.
 What do you mean?
 But that referral was always here.
 So it was Genno himself
 who came here to work with that referral thirty years ago.
 Oh!
 That is to sayΓÇªprobably.
 At that time, he used a referral
 that couldnΓÇÖt be distinguished from the real thing.
 And then he went to the trouble of making one
 that would be recognized as a fake if compared with that one.
 Why?
 Even with old referrals,
 he would be discovered if reinvestigated again.
 So he got rid of it right after you blew the whistle on him.
 In order to conceal the fact that he worked here thirty years ago.
 ItΓÇÖs because at that time in the village,
 he set as many Paper Bombs as were available.
 Why?
 WhyΓÇÖd you do such a thing?!
 Long ago, there was a village
 called Heat Devil Village in the Land of Mountains.
 This is the village where I was born.
 Heat Devil Village?
 You donΓÇÖt know it?
 NoΓÇª
 The only thing recorded in the Bingo Book you brought
 is that GennoΓÇÖs homeland is the Land of Mountains.
 To be precise, Heat Devil Village in the Land of Mountains.
 The village itself vanished,
 so it probably ended up not being recorded.
 Thirty years ago,
 the Village Hidden in Leaves and Heat Devil Village were at war.
 Neither side didnΓÇÖt give an inch and the battle was in deadlock.
 We launched a successful sneak attack on Heat Devil Village,
 taking advantage of the absence of their main forces.
 The tide of the war turned to the LeafΓÇÖs advantage in one shot.
 The only thing written in the history books
 is that an armistice was concluded three months after that.
 These three months are whatΓÇÖs peculiar.
 Heat Devil Village shouldΓÇÖve been thinking about a counterattack
 before accepting a cease fire.
 Here it is. ltΓÇÖs my dadΓÇÖs diary from thirty years ago.
 Really?
 Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully.
 Here.
 Thanks.
 ""A middle-aged man from the Hidden Sand came
 ""with a master carpentry referral.""
 ""His skills arenΓÇÖt great, but I decided to hire him as I want manpower.""
 The date is one week after the Heat Devil Village attack.
 Then like you thoughtΓÇª
 Checkmate. This is Genno.
 It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf
 and to set Paper Bombs throughout the village.
 The operation was for the main forces of Heat Devil Village
 to invade the Village Hidden in the Leaves at the same time
 as the Paper Bomb explosions and inflict a devastating blow.
 I went out to various sites and set Paper Bombs.
 The Leaf village did not have substantial Anbu Black Ops as they do now.
 So I was able to move about with ease.
 Right around the time when two and a half months had passed,
 I finished setting almost all of the Paper BombsΓÇª
 and all that was left was to wait for my comrades to attack.
 But my comrades never came.
 Why?
 The leader of Heat Devil Village who had insisted on ΓÇ£do-or-dieΓÇ¥ resistance;
 lost his life in an accident.
 And the man who assumed the position of leader in his place
 agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf.
 What?
 ""Genno doesnΓÇÖt show up at the scene. I wonder what the deal is.""
 He disappeared having left behind the Paper Bombs.
 As for me, my intention was to immediately return to the Hidden Leaf.
 I thought the ceasefire would just be a temporary thing anyway.
 But Heat Devil Village would never give me another mission.
 Two weeks after the ceasefire,
 the Village Hidden in the Vale launched a sneak attack on Heat Devil Village
 and it was destroyed.
 No way!
 They were targeted at a moment
 when they were weariest from the battle with the Leaf.
 Their defenses were probably also down due to the ceasefire.
 ""Two months has passed sinceΓÇª
 Where did Genno disappear off toΓÇª?""
 Then why come back to the Leaf Village now after all this time?
 You set Paper Bombs because it was your mission, right?
 If Heat Devil Village is no more,
 then there should be no reason to go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf!
 Could it beΓÇªsomeone asked you to smash the Leaf?
 Rest easy.
 I havenΓÇÖt been commissioned or commanded by anyone.
 Then why?
 How can I put this? It felt like a waste.
 A waste? WhatΓÇÖs up with that?
 IΓÇÖm getting old and I could be taken to heaven any time now.
 If I were to die as is,
 IΓÇÖd be buried in darkness without anyone learning of my traps.
 If so, then I thought IΓÇÖd put them to good use before I die.
 Are you serious?
 You tried to kill people in the village just for that reason?
 I canΓÇÖt believe that!
 Then treating me to ramen was toΓÇª
 It was to find out
 about the present state of affairs in the Leaf.
 Damn you! You jerk!
 YouΓÇÖll understand when you get older!
 I donΓÇÖt understand! As for meΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt ever understand it!
 IΓÇÖll show you my final big job as a Trapper!
 No way will I let you do that!
 My friends are now in the middle of removing all the Paper Bombs!
 I wonΓÇÖt let the bombs blow up!
 Sounds like quite a struggle.
 But who said I was going to blow up the Paper Bombs?
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about? You just said that before you dieΓÇª
 I said I would put them to good use. YouΓÇÖre na├»ve, boy.
 What?
 I can put them to sufficiently good use even without blowing them up.
 Katsu!
 A Shinobi reads two or three moves ahead
 and prepares several moves in advance.
 Remember that!
 Shikamaru!
 What is it?
 The Academy students are saying theyΓÇÖre tired.
 What should we do?
 The Academy students?
 The Kunai Knife practice, right?
 What? They were still doing that?
 You idiot! You were the one who had them do it.
 Oh, oh yeah. Then have them go ahead wrap things up.
 Rather, itΓÇÖd be trouble if they were to get lucky and hit the center.
 Oh!
 What is it?
 I get it. So thatΓÇÖs it!
 ItΓÇÖs unnatural for a guy so prepared
 to casually entrust the final explosive device to pure luck.
 What do you mean?
 A Shinobi of GennoΓÇÖs level should blow it up with the most effective timing.
 In other words,
 it doesnΓÇÖt matter whether the Paper Bombs explode or not.
 ItΓÇÖs just a diversion.
 HeΓÇÖs really after something else!

 Choji, things might get pretty ugly.
 YouΓÇÖve figured something out, huh?
 We need to contact the Fifth Hokage.
 To not let the returning forces enter the village.
 Got it! ButΓÇª Why?
 If the Paper Bombs were all a diversion,
 then the moment he makes his move
 is most likely when the main forces return!

 Try building up that red Chakra right now.
 Hmm. Even you say soΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll give it a try, butΓÇª
 How about it?
 Hmm, itΓÇÖs not right.
 ItΓÇÖs the same Chakra as always.
 Jeez, you have no talent.
 DonΓÇÖt be talking all high and mighty!
 In the first place,
 I really donΓÇÖt understand those two types of Chakra myself!
 Just keep trying.
 HumphΓÇª So he doesnΓÇÖt understand itΓÇª himself, eh.
 It seems Naruto himself still hasnΓÇÖt realized that
 the red Chakra is the Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇÖs Chakra.
 Well, guessing from his storyΓÇª
 it seems the excitement of danger and heightened emotion
 are the key to summon the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.
 No good, not good.
 Only the usual ChakraΓÇÖs coming out.
 Say, Pervy SageΓÇª
 What the heck does the red Chakra and the technique youΓÇÖre going to teach me
 have to do with each other?
 Listen, boy.
 For the technique IΓÇÖm about to teach you,
 the Chakra youΓÇÖve had until now is not nearly enough.
 Therefore, youΓÇÖll have to able to pull out and use the ΓÇ£otherΓÇ¥ Chakra
 that has been dormant within you at any time you need.
 But how do you know that I have such a Chakra?
 Oh, just what I wanted to hear.
 ActuallyΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs because IΓÇÖm a sage.
 JeezΓÇªthatΓÇÖs no answer.
 Anyway, the special Chakra that only you have
 will become your greatest weapon.
 Greatest weapon?
 Not using that is like wasting treasure.
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to forcedly do the same training as everyone else.
 Everyone has what theyΓÇÖre good at and poor at.
 You have your own style.
 Your training until now, maintaining and releasing a set amount of Chakra,
 was in other words,
 training to control the suppression of Chakra so that you wouldnΓÇÖt get exhausted.
 But you who have a lot of stamina
 should be about power rather than a cheap trick.
 You, who has two types of Chakra and doesnΓÇÖt exhaust easily,
 should release the largest amount of Chakra you can
 and train to increase the absolute amount of Chakra that you can use.
 Then there are tons of Jutsu and techniques you can use.
 What, for example?
 For exampleΓÇªsummoning Jutsu that IΓÇÖm going to teach you now.
 Summoning?
 Right.
 ItΓÇÖs a type of spatio-temporal technique
 where you sign a contract in blood with all kinds of living creatures
 and summon whenever you like with Ninjutsu.
 Oh! That sounds awesome. Teach me quick!
 Before thatΓÇª
 first, itΓÇÖs necessary to use up all of your usual Chakra.
 Okay!
 Leave it to me.
 WellΓÇª So you can use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I have a good idea how to get rid of my Chakra quickly.
 Well, youΓÇÖve multiplied quite a bit.
 Listen up. WeΓÇÖre going to have a battle royal now.
 The last one left will be the strongest meΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖre going to determine the me among me!
 ΓÇô Yeah! 					ΓÇô Yeah!
 I see. Good thinking considering heΓÇÖs stupid.
 Okay, letΓÇÖs go!
 My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.
 The finale is near at last.
 Well done.
 Sure enough, IΓÇÖm the strongest me.
 It looks like youΓÇÖve finally used up almost all of your Chakra.
 Now, at last IΓÇÖll teach you the technique.
 Oh, IΓÇÖve been waiting!
 First, IΓÇÖll show you.
 Watch carefully.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Ooh, so cool.
 Open that scroll.
 ItΓÇÖs a contract with the summoning toads
 that IΓÇÖve taken over from generations.
 Sign your name in your own blood
 and stamp the fingerprints of one hand in blood under that.
 Then build up Chakra in the place you want to summon
 and set down the hand you contracted.
 The Sign is Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
 NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.
 OkayΓÇªThis is fine, right?
 ItΓÇÖs easier for you to release red Chakra right now.
 So give it a try.
 I already am.
 Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.
 Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.

 Not bad!
 Your reach encompasses from medium to long distance and you use a puppet.
 I didn't think you would do well in close combat.
 With that Puppet Master Jutsu where you have to concentrate
 on the control of the puppetΓÇª

 YouΓÇÖre very aware of the weakness of a puppet master!
 However, from here on,
 IΓÇÖll show you the essence of this Ninjutsu fighting style!
 The real terror of CrowΓÇª my puppet of warfare!
 This is Poison Smoke Bomb!

 DonΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª!
 ItΓÇÖs futileΓÇª He canΓÇÖt move anymoreΓÇª
 I had the beetles burrow into every jointΓÇª
 He stuffed beetles into its joints so that the puppet canΓÇÖt move?
 That was his aim from the beginning!
 The beetles are passing through the threads of my ChakraΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs it! As I recall, their food is Chakra.
 At this rate, my location will be found out!
 He cut the Chakra threads himselfΓÇª?
 You got careless!
 Instantly reattaching the Chakra threads that have once been cut
 is simple for a first-rate puppet master.
 AndΓÇª
 Crow is a puppetΓÇª

 Just like that, the insectsΓÇª!
 The Chakra threads have been bitten through!
 What?! WhyΓÇª?!
 Where did these insects spring out from?!
 By beating away the bait insects along the Chakra threads,
 you dropped your guard.
 You didnΓÇÖt noticeΓÇª the wriggling insects behind you.
 The insects were moving the whole timeΓÇª
 heading for your headband.
 W-What did you say?!
 The one blow earlierΓÇª
 I pretended to miss and stuck one of those beetles on you.
 But how did you know where I was with one such beetleΓÇª?
 IΓÇªhate explaining the same thing twice.
 Shino? 					Why are you here?!
 I put a female beetle on you before you left the arena!
 The females have almost no smellΓÇª
 Only a male can sniff out the subtle smell of the female.
 Then, this one beetle on my foreheadΓÇª
 RightΓÇª ItΓÇÖs a female.
 The poison has circulated through my whole body, huhΓÇª
 It looks like I wonΓÇÖt be able to go to back you upΓÇª

 Aw cΓÇÖmon! I told you a little while ago, she saved me!
 What happened?
 Sorry, my hand slipped.
 I see.
 IΓÇÖll clean this up right away.
 Anko.
 Yes?
 The studies here, the Hokage knows about them.
 I understand.
 So, youΓÇÖre saying that this girl named Isaribi saved you?
 Yeah, I owe my life to her.
 Even if thatΓÇÖs so, thereΓÇÖs no doubt that this girl named Isaribi
 was one of the people who attacked us.
 Our mission is to protect the governmentΓÇÖs money
 and catch the Demon of the Ocean.
 ThatΓÇÖs right, and no matter how you look at it,
 thereΓÇÖs no doubt that sheΓÇÖs the Demon of the Ocean!
 Yeah, but I think thereΓÇÖs some reason for all that.
 IΓÇÖm going to follow her and--!
 YouΓÇÖre talking nonsense.
 Besides, even if we were to follow her, we've got no idea where she is.
 No, I have one.
 Really, Shino?
 ItΓÇÖs something I heard.
 It seems thereΓÇÖs one island in this country
 that played a central role in a series of spiriting away incidents.
 Where is it?!
 A deserted island where the Demon of the Ocean lives,
 Demon Island.
 Demon Island?
 Sensei, are you doing okay?
 Yes, more importantly,
 thereΓÇÖs something I want to tell you about the Demon of the Ocean.
 The true identity of this thing called the Demon of the Ocean
 is a human whose flesh has been altered.
 What?!
 What did you say?
 DonΓÇÖt muck things up like that again.
 Yes sir.
 She's out, the monster!
 What theΓÇª?
 ΓÇô Get out of here. ΓÇô You're bad luck.
 Take this!
 She's the one who was spirited away.
 And why would she be the only one who came back?
 What are you talking about?
 A spiriting away that occurred ten years ago in the Land of Sea,
 but that was not the working of a demon.
 Orochimaru kidnapped humans to use as live subjects
 for his research at the time.
 OrochimaruΓÇª
 Is Orochimaru mixed up in this current matter?
 Wait a minute. Orochimaru and tests!
 Why are you suddenly saying such things?
 I have to explain it to you from when Orochimaru left the village.
 Over ten years ago,
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs desire to satisfy his own inquiring mind and further his power
 was such that he gradually exceeded the scope of a Shinobi
 and in the end, got involved in developing what are called Forbidden Jutsu.
 How unfortunate.
 Naturally, this soon became known to the village.
 After Orochimaru!
 Stop that guy!
 But Orochimaru, who traveled in and out of country on missionsΓÇª
 had several other private facilities outside of the Leaf VillageΓÇª
 So one of those is on Demon Island?
 So, the people who disappeared?
 They were used for human experiments.
 What?
 Damn Orochimaru! What does he think people are?
 So, what are we going to do?
 ItΓÇÖs obvious, isnΓÇÖt it? We get into their hideout!
 And we have to get lsaribi back!
 ItΓÇÖs settled.
 WeΓÇÖll continue and hit the Demon of the OceanΓÇÖs hideout.
 Sensei, how long have you known about Demon Island?
 ItΓÇÖs because Orochimaru was the Jonin in charge of me.
 Huh?
 Tell me when we get close to the island.
 The pain is gradually getting stronger.
 SomebodyΓÇÖs coming.
 What shall we do?
 Do as you please.
 Yes.
 The arroganceΓÇª One day IΓÇÖll pay him back!
 This way.
 Hurry!
 How is it, Shino?
 No problem.
 Okay!
 So, a collection ship is on the move, huh?
 Just the right time.
 Good work, I was right to send you back to Mother Island.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong? YouΓÇÖre pale.
 When will I return to normal?
 Like you said, IΓÇÖve gathered information about the ships
 from the market and the village, even the attacks.
 SoΓÇª
 What are you bringing up, Isaribi?
 You canΓÇÖt possibly have forgotten your role as a prototype.
 As a converted body, your cooperation in generating dataΓÇª
 That was one of the conditions of the promise.
 DonΓÇÖt worry, weΓÇÖll soon be done getting data from you.
 IΓÇÖll keep the promiseΓÇª as long as I donΓÇÖt change my mind.
 You understand, right?
 Yes.
 Well, if you understand, go keep our guests company.

 Shino?
 You go ahead. Seems like IΓÇÖm the opponent for him.

 His Jutsu is not suited for your style of close combat.

 Orochimaru?
 DonΓÇÖt play dumb. HeΓÇÖs here, isnΓÇÖt he?
 A Curse Mark responds even though the operator isnΓÇÖt aroundΓÇª
 Stuff like that happens huh?
 True, Orochimaru was hereΓÇª
 But that was over half a month ago.
 No way.
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter if you donΓÇÖt believe me.
 So the pain I felt so farΓÇª
 has been the influence of OrochimaruΓÇÖs presence here half a month ago?
 Wait a minute.
 Sensei!
 You two!
 Oh my, you brought Genin.
 Anko, youΓÇÖre all grown upΓÇª
 Who is that?
 AmachiΓÇª a Medical Ninja who partnered with Orochimaru,
 and was running various experiments here.
 OrochimaruΓÇÖs not here. This whole incident was all his doing.
 Him?!
 Hey you! How dare you run those ridiculous tests!
 Ridiculous? This is no joke, IΓÇÖve devoted my life to this research.
 What was that?!
 Look! This one has the physical ability to adapt to water.
 She combines the ability to breathe underwater
 and the muscle strength to move freely and quickly.
 ItΓÇÖs been a dream of mine for many years,
 to form a Ninja corps for underwater combat.
 This is the first step.
 A Ninja corps for underwater combat?
 ThatΓÇÖs right, a military corps able to move freely underwater
 that the common person definitely could not imitate.
 When that happens, we can divide land and land
 and completely control marine shipping routes!
 Wonderful, is it not?
 With this strength, IΓÇÖll stand on top of the world.
 And IΓÇÖll make Orochimaru regret abandoning this research.
 People are not your tools!
 Oh my, you're so young,
 you donΓÇÖt understand the greatness of this researchΓÇª
 Well, youΓÇÖre average guinea pigs who donΓÇÖt know any better,
 so I donΓÇÖt think I want you to understand.
 Bastard!
 ThatΓÇÖs good, Isaribi.
 Out of the way, Isaribi!
 No!
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong? You canΓÇÖt fight by just running around in circles.
 Damn it!
 Why are you protecting that guy?
 That guy did this to you, Isaribi!
 Yeah, butΓÇª!
 But it canΓÇÖt be helped.
 This is the only person who can return my body back to normal.
 He promised.
 Look.
 IsaribiΓÇª
 People are judged based solely on their appearance.
 People donΓÇÖt dare come near me just from being covered in bandagesΓÇªΓÇª
 A monster with these scales would be out of the question.
 I want to return to my former body, I want to be a human!
 For that reason, I decided IΓÇÖd do anything!
 YouΓÇÖre a human being even now, Isaribi!
 Huh?!
 And yet you join with those guys to attack and sink ships.
 IsnΓÇÖt that far more like something a monster would do?!
 Stop it, shut up!
 I-IΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt want to hear it! Shut up, shut up!
 Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?
 NoΓÇª I-IΓÇÖm the same as you!
 YouΓÇÖre lying!
 What are you talking about? YouΓÇÖre a normal human.
 I want to be like you too!
 DonΓÇÖt cry IsaribiΓÇª IΓÇÖll properly return you to normal.
 Watch out!
 A bulls-eye letter bomb.
 Thanks to Isaribi doing a good job of attracting your attention.
 S-SenseiΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll leave the rest to you.
 Okay.
 LetΓÇÖs go, Isaribi.
 Wait!
 DonΓÇÖt go, Isaribi!
 Damn it!
 WeΓÇÖd better take care of this right away.
 Give it upΓÇª ItΓÇÖs over.
 WeΓÇÖll make you a guinea pig for Amachi, too.
 Insect clone?!
 WeΓÇÖre the same Chakra-eating colleagues, after all.
 It wonΓÇÖt be easy to finish a fight.
 He disappeared?
 What is he thinking?
 There you go!
 Naruto!
 IΓÇÖm going to strangle you to death like this.
 What--?!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu, a success.
 All right, you did it, Ino!
 Damn it! Let me go, let me go!
 ThatΓÇÖs dirty of you!
 What are you talking about?
 There are no such things as being too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.
 And you call yourself a Ninja?
 Shut up!
 What?
 This place is collapsing.
 TheyΓÇÖre planning to take care of us along with the building.
 Oh, youΓÇÖve gotta be kidding me!
 Hurry, the entrance is already useless.
 I thought this place would be traced soon.
 ItΓÇÖs an old building,
 but a damn good tomb for the likes of them.
 One person didnΓÇÖt make it in time?
 Oh well, doesnΓÇÖt have much of an influence on attacking a collection ship.
 Damn! WhereΓÇÖs the exit?!
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand

 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Well, whereΓÇÖs the exit, Shino?!
 How should I know?
 Then, what do we do, Ino?!
 We just have to stop complaining and run!
 But I donΓÇÖt see an exit at all!

 IΓÇÖve done it! The water is turning!
 It seems itΓÇÖs going to be easier than I thought to break it.
 Then IΓÇÖll go take a little rest until itΓÇÖs doneΓÇªwith this.
 Hey! What is that?!
 I need it to kill the time. And also to get some sleep.
 Huh! The way itΓÇÖs going, it wonΓÇÖt even be an afternoon nap!
 Is that soΓÇª? Call me when it is broken.
 Just wait!
 If it keeps up like this, IΓÇÖll learn it within today!
 Keep on Training! Pop Goes the Water Balloon
 Oh man! Why doesnΓÇÖt it break!
 Huh? Are you done with it?
 AhΓÇªwell, itΓÇÖs almost done or how should I call it.
 Oh boyΓÇª
 It seems like I went beyond an afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.
 Hey, heyΓÇªhow do I break it?
 DidnΓÇÖt I tell you I canΓÇÖt give a detailed explanation until itΓÇÖs broken?
 All right, I understandΓÇª
 Naturally, youΓÇÖre supposed to realize it through trial and error
 when mastering a Jutsu, butΓÇª
 Yeah, yeah.
 I guess IΓÇÖll teach you just a tiny bit on the JutsuΓÇª
 You, try rotating the water!
 Oh, okay.
 Right or leftΓÇªwhich direction did you imagine when you rotate it?
 HmmΓÇªwell, to the leftΓÇª
 Hey, come over here.
 OkayΓÇª
 Huh, I thought soΓÇª
 W-What?
 You are in fact a right-rotation type.
 Right?
 In order to build up Chakra,
 it is necessary to blend the energyΓÇª
 Chakra 							Spiritual energy       Physical energy 		So everybody unconsciously builds up 		Chakra inside the body by rotating it. 55	01:54:25:29	01:54:29:20               Right                             Left 		Whether the rotation at that point 		is to the right or to the left
 differs in the individual.
 Therefore, if you imagine the rotation of the water balloon
 opposite to that of your rotation-type in this training,
 your Chakra flow divides and resists
 and the momentum of the rotation does not get on track.
 You should be able to figure that kind of stuff on your own.
 But how did you figure out that IΓÇÖm a right-type so fast?
 The cowlick on your head!
 It's pretty much determined that youΓÇÖre a right type if a whorl rolls to the right
 and youΓÇÖre a left-type if it rolls to the left.
 ItΓÇÖs simple.
 Huh, so I have a right roll!
 Yes, so if you want to rotate it, you have to imagine a right rotation.
 I never really paid attention that until nowΓÇª
 But this Jutsu is just the one for you.
 Hand sign is completely unnecessary. All you need is Chakra.
 There is no need to learn a finicky hand sign!
 ItΓÇÖs okay to be stupid!
 IΓÇÖm not stupid!
 IΓÇÖm the man whoΓÇÖs eventually going to become a Hokage!
 ItΓÇÖs easy once you understand!
 This Jutsu, IΓÇÖll completely master it if I got three days!
 Three days, huh?
 This Jutsu is a Ninjutsu that the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.
 HuhΓÇª?
 It took him three whole years to perfect this JutsuΓÇª
 This Jutsu is second from the top
 on the six degrees of difficulty in masteringΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.
 In order to learn this move, there are three steps in the training.
 This ΓÇ£Water Balloon BreakingΓÇ¥ is the first step.
 It took the genius Ninja, the Fourth HokageΓÇª
 Three yearsΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no point in explaining anymore to someone
 who canΓÇÖt even clear the first step.
 Do the rest by yourself!
 Take care! IΓÇÖm going to return to the town.
 I have to gather some informationΓÇª
 What will you do?
 A-rank in degree of difficulty in masteringΓÇª
 The Ninjutsu left behind by the Fourth HokageΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm not gonna go back yet!
 HuhΓÇª
 So longΓÇª DonΓÇÖt go overboard with it.
 Now, what will happen?
 ItΓÇÖs something to be concerned aboutΓÇª
 Mister!
 Why donΓÇÖt you stop by?
 This month is our special service month.
 Whoa! ItΓÇÖs a special service month?
 The more you visit, the more you benefit.
 Here you go, a stamp card!
 IΓÇÖll give you lots and lots of service!
 IΓÇÖll come, IΓÇÖll come!
 Hey! Come on down, Shu!
 Hey, hey, where is the toilet?
 I donΓÇÖt have time to spend three years.
 All right now!
 Training, once again today! IΓÇÖm gonna work hard like a blaze!
 Break! Break! Break!
 Why wonΓÇÖt it break?
 Little Jiraiya, youΓÇÖre so naughty!
 Men are all naughty!
 Dang it!
 Three days have passed since I got the tip from that Pervy SageΓÇª
 The rubber is stretched this much, but why wonΓÇÖt it break?
 What am I doing different from that Pervy Sage?
 This is great! This is so great!
 What the--?
 Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.
 IΓÇÖm gonna eat now!
 Huh?
 What's the matter?
 Oh dang it!
 Darn it! Why is it like this?!
 No need to learn a finicky hand sign! ltΓÇÖs okay to be stupid!
 He said that thereΓÇÖs no need to form a hand signal, butΓÇª
 Hey! ThatΓÇÖs not your toyΓÇª
 This is it!
 Hurry up and wake up! Hey, you Pervy Sage!
 UhΓÇª G-Good timing.
 Why donΓÇÖt you bring me some waterΓÇª
 Water?
 The first step is cleared!
 ClearedΓÇª?
 Well, letΓÇÖs have you show it to me.
 All right! Watch it carefully!
 Left hand?
 Go!
 All right! See that?! See that?!
 YouΓÇÖre sleeping!
 Sorry, sorry.
 IΓÇÖm tired from the days and nights of gathering information.
 But that seems suspicious to begin with!
 You still stink of alcohol too!
 NeverthelessΓÇª
 You rotate the water inside the water balloon that you hold in your left hand
 by repeatedly applying it with your right handΓÇª
 It seems little strange of an idea, butΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre an interesting kid.
 You understood the trick pretty well. ltΓÇÖs all thanks to me, though.
 ItΓÇÖs thanks to this guy!
 Huh?
 I realized after I saw this cat playing with the water balloon.
 He kept on flicking it with his paw many times
 and the water inside shocked in all different kinds of directionΓÇª
 Then it came to me like ΓÇ£bingo!ΓÇ¥
 How did it come like ΓÇ£bingoΓÇ¥?
 The time when the Pervy Sage first showed me breaking itΓÇª
 I remembered how the water balloon surface was not smooth.
 Until then, I was always only rotating the water
 in the one same directionΓÇª
 I realized that the Pervy SageΓÇÖs water balloon was not smooth
 because the water inside was rotating in different directions.
 And after doing it in my own way, it broke!
 It seems itΓÇÖs still not possible for you
 to rotate it violently with one hand, butΓÇª
 I suppose you thought it out in your own way.
 ThatΓÇÖs just what he expected of me!
 AnyhowΓÇª The first step is complete for now.
 All right!
 Do you want to see it one more time? One more time!
 Oww!
 You used too much Chakra and it gradually reached the point
 where thereΓÇÖs burden on the Chakra NetworkΓÇª
 But the next one wonΓÇÖt be like this!
 Okay. Now, we will proceed to the second step.
 Yeah!
 It seems like we can finally go into some serious training!
 ΓÇô Here you go! 					ΓÇô Huh?
 Rubber ball? Something like this again?!
 Now, youΓÇÖll break this one!
 ItΓÇÖs one hundred times harder than the water balloon!
 ItΓÇÖs hardΓÇª
 The first step is rotation, the second step is force.
 Since there is no water inside,
 itΓÇÖs more difficult to imagine the rotation of Chakra,
 so it becomes more difficult to rotate the Chakra as well.
 ThatΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll leave that to your own judgment.
 I need to learn a trick again to do this, donΓÇÖt I?
 Well then, IΓÇÖll go gather some information.
 Hey! Wait, wait!
 LetΓÇÖs train together for the first time in a while!
 I donΓÇÖt mind if you take a nap.
 DonΓÇÖt depend on me!
 You must have some kind of misunderstanding!
 I did say that IΓÇÖll teach you the Jutsu,
 but I donΓÇÖt have the obligation to teach you every step of the way.
 If you canΓÇÖt do it by yourself, then thatΓÇÖs it.
 DonΓÇÖt be childish foreverΓÇª Become more respectable like a Shinobi!
 Well, well then.
 If you can at least teach meΓÇª the trick againΓÇª
 Money!
 MoneyΓÇªmoneyΓÇªmoneyΓÇª
 W-What do you mean ΓÇ£be respectable like a ShinobiΓÇ¥?!
 Even though you say that, youΓÇÖre an dirty and greedy adult!
 YouΓÇÖre not a respectable Shinobi at all!
 ItΓÇÖs way more difficult than the time with the water balloonΓÇª
 A-AndΓÇª
 my hands and arms hurt.
 Dang it! How many days am I going to be doing the same thing!
 Second from the top in  the difficulty of masteringΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt depend on me!
 You must have some kind of misunderstanding!
 Dang it!
 Hey, Naruto.
 What did you come here for?
 Go buy some food from the town below.
 What?! Why me?
 Hey youΓÇª
 Even if for a while, youΓÇÖre still learning the Jutsu from me.
 Here you go, thanks for waiting.
 Thank you.
 How dare he put on a masterΓÇÖs face only at a time like this
 when he doesnΓÇÖt teach me anythingΓÇª
 Dad, buy me some ice cream.
 I want this one that cracks.
 Here.
 Why? I can eat all of it by myself.
 Nope, when you get home, your mother will have supper ready.
 Okay!
 HeyΓÇªyou knowΓÇª
 Huh?
 Can you be around my training for just a whileΓÇªtoday?
 I donΓÇÖt have time for that.
 I have to immediately go to town.
 Unless you think for yourself and get a grip of the trick for yourself,
 itΓÇÖll never work.
 I thought I told you three weeks ago!
 DonΓÇÖt be spoiled like a kid. You are a Ninja.
 I know that without your telling me!
 Just thought I'd ask.
 Hurry up and go, you Pervy Sage!
 Oh no, little Jiraiya, you tell so many lies!
 What do you mean?! Everything is true!
 Dang it! It doesnΓÇÖt break no matter how much I tryΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm just dripping away my Chakra this way.
 AlsoΓÇª
 The more I increase the amount of flow, the worse the pain gets.
 ButΓÇª How do I say it?
 If I donΓÇÖt go all out as if to explode the Chakra,
 itΓÇÖs not going to break!
 ThatΓÇÖs it!
 If I understand the amount of Chakra that flows from the pain I feelΓÇª
 Then I can bear the pain to the limit and all at onceΓÇª
 No, not yetΓÇª
 Not yet!
 Not yetΓÇªstore it!
 Now!
 Oww!
 HmmΓÇª There seems to have been a little progress.
 Humph!
 IΓÇÖve still only opened a hole and it hasnΓÇÖt popped with a bang!
 Hey, donΓÇÖt pretend to be so tough. Here!
 YouΓÇÖve done well, all on your own power.
 ItΓÇÖs so good!
 YesΓÇª
 Oh yeah. Maybe weΓÇÖll test a bit.
 What, what?
 Give me your right hand.
 WhatΓÇÖs this?
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 He tells me  ""focus, focus, focus!""
 But I've never been good at it, ever.
 Speaking of concentration,
 Iruka Sensei used to scold me often at the Ninja Academy
 for my lack of concentration.
 OhΓÇªI would've listened to him better if I knew this would happen.

 So it was also that guy who used Genjutsu!
 YeahΓÇªthereΓÇÖs no mistake.
 I didnΓÇÖt expect thatΓÇª
 Sand Village would betray Leaf Village.
 The treaty is simply a camouflage to make the enemy let down their guard.
 The petty little battle game ends now.
 From this point on, the course of history will change!
 Are you saying that youΓÇÖre starting a war?
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 One should avoid resolution through armed force
 and should rather seek a solution through negotiations.

 Stop fussing.

 YouΓÇÖll have many more chances to see it.
 But this year, that kid from the Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?
 And I wonΓÇÖt have a chance to see thatΓÇª
 I wonΓÇÖt be able to die peacefully.
 WhatΓÇÖs that?!

 ThereΓÇÖs no meaning in continuing this fight!
 DonΓÇÖt forget our mission!
 Out of my wayΓÇª!
 What are you guys doing?!
 The operation is already underway!
 What in the world is going on?
 Gaara!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?!
 His wound is deeper than I thought!
 And moreover his Chakra is pretty drained!
 In that case, what about using that thingΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs impossible to do right away!
 Idiot! ItΓÇÖs all because you didnΓÇÖt wait for the signal
 and tried to become the Perfect PossessionΓÇª
 What should we do?!
 Are you saying we have to do this without Gaara?
 IsnΓÇÖt Gaara here yet?!
 Gaara is SandΓÇÖs trump card.
 We have to get Gaara to do his work, no matter what!
 You guys leave for the moment and tend to GaaraΓÇÖs wounds!
 As soon as GaaraΓÇÖs Chakra has been restoredΓÇª
 the operation will recommence!
 Got it!
 What about you, Sensei?!
 IΓÇÖm gonna suppress those guys!
 Do you think things will go according to your plan?
 IΓÇÖll make them soΓÇª
 Go!
 Okay!
 Is Orochimaru the host of this party?
 DunnoΓÇª In any case, letΓÇÖs heat this thing up.
 SasukeΓÇª
 Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.
 YouΓÇÖve already achieved Chunin level.
 If youΓÇÖre a Leaf Shinobi, be of service to the Leaf!
 In other words, IΓÇÖm supposed to take down that jerk Gaara, right?
 A continuation of earlier on, right?
 DonΓÇÖt pursue too far.
 From here on, itΓÇÖs no longer an exam. ltΓÇÖs the real thing!
 What I have to do thoughΓÇª is the same!
 I wonΓÇÖt let him through!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 Boy oh boyΓÇª
 We intended to take Sasuke while Gaara was causing the trouble.
 But not everything goes as planned.
 I seeΓÇª Is that so?
 So Leaf Village andΓÇª Sasuke were the target, huh?
 Is the Leaf such a big catch?
 More importantly, if Gaara wakes up,
 IΓÇÖll be able to show you something much more interesting.
 Well, anywayΓÇª
 Your thick-headedness has caused the Leaf to be outmaneuvered.
 ItΓÇÖs my win.
 Nothing is decided until the very end.
 I believe thatΓÇÖs what I taught youΓÇª
 Orochimaru.
 I thought this day would eventually arrive.
 HoweverΓÇª
 You wonΓÇÖt get my head that easily!
 I told you, didnΓÇÖt I?
 It is preferable to decide the Fifth Hokage quicklyΓÇª
 Third HokageΓÇª
 because you willΓÇªdie here.
 I wonder how the Chunin Exams are going?
 I wonder if NarutoΓÇÖs match is over yet?
 The first match was with Neji, right?
 I want him to win that match somehow or other.
 ThatΓÇÖs no good!
 A teacher mustnΓÇÖt root for one particular student!
 All the graduating students are dear to him!
 I must root for all of them equally!
 But I stillΓÇªwant Naruto to winΓÇª
 Are you worried about Naruto?
 Well, of courseΓÇª!
 As I thoughtΓÇª
 Y-You guysΓÇª
 I told you to do ten laps around the school grounds, didnΓÇÖt I?!
 We finished that long ago.
 While you were daydreaming, Sensei.
 When our teacher is in that state, he canΓÇÖt teach a class!
 So letΓÇÖs call it quits for today!
 N-No, no! IΓÇÖm continuing with class.
 I wonder what that smoke isΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs coming from the direction of the exam arenaΓÇª
 IsnΓÇÖt there some disturbance to the east?
 I wonder if something happened?
 That OrochimaruΓÇª
 What should we do?
 Should we send reinforcements?
 NoΓÇª ItΓÇÖs dangerous to make a move when we don't really know
 what the situation is.
 If the mastermind is OrochimaruΓÇª
 even more so.
 Is OrochimaruΓÇª that dangerous a guy?
 OriginallyΓÇªhe was a student of the Third Hokage.
 So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?
 Long ago, when the Fourth Hokage was decidedΓÇª
 Orochimaru apparently asserted that he was capable of taking on that role.
 But his request was denied.
 And shortly afterwards, that guy slipped out of this village.
 Orochimaru most likely holds a grudge against
 the Third Hokage because of that.
 RevengeΓÇªis it?
 Probably.
 Long ago, when I was a kidΓÇª
 thereΓÇÖs one thing I remember thinking when I saw that guyΓÇª
 That he didnΓÇÖt seem humanΓÇª
 That he seems to be something that just took on a human formΓÇª
 FrighteningΓÇª
 SimplyΓÇªfrightening.
 Reporting!
 A large boa has appeared near the eastern gate of the Leaf Village!
 And behind it, some one hundred Sand Ninja are infiltrating the country!
 They are currently engaged in armed conflict with our Shinobi
 who were patrolling nearby!
 The SandΓÇª?!
 Leave Squad One and Two behind and make for the eastern gate.
 Immediately!
 ΓÇô Yes sir! 					ΓÇô Yes sir!
 We wonΓÇÖt let you past this point!
 ThereΓÇÖs quite a large number.
 We were careless!
 And even Lord Hokage has beenΓÇª
 Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier!
 Yeah.
 WhatΓÇª?
 Orochimaru!
 Orochimaru?!
 Why is that guyΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt tell me that theyΓÇÖre after Sasuke again?!
 Sasuke!
 Huh?
 HeΓÇÖs not thereΓÇª?
 Sakura, stay there for a while.
 IΓÇÖm gonna go reduce the number of enemies.
 Darn! IΓÇÖm worried about Lord Hokage, butΓÇª
 Leave above to Anbu.
 BesidesΓÇª
 Lord Hokage isnΓÇÖt the kind of guy who can be taken down that easily.
 ButΓÇª
 After all, he is the Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Are you so happy, youΓÇÖre crying?
 OrΓÇª
 do you have an iota of sadness in your heart to kill me, your teacher?
 NoΓÇª
 Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepyΓÇª
 but IΓÇÖm finally awake.
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thought.
 I know you arenΓÇÖt someone who would hold a grudge.
 You have neither a goal nor motive.
 HmmΓÇª I guessΓÇª
 I do kind of have a goal.
 If I were to explain itΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs interesting to watch things that move.
 I get no pleasure if something doesnΓÇÖt move.
 Like a windmill that doesnΓÇÖt turnΓÇª
 Well, it may have some kind of appeal once in a while.
 But usually, itΓÇÖs not worth looking at it.
 Right nowΓÇªwith a wind called ΓÇ£Destroy the Leaf Village,ΓÇ¥
 I want to turn that windmill.
 YouΓÇÖre the same as alwaysΓÇª
 Sakura!
 It was worth teaching you Genjutsu survival training
 during the Genin Exam.
 You truly have a talent for it.
 Huh?
 Release the Genjutsu and wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Naruto will be delighted.
 HeΓÇÖll be getting a mission after such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be carefulΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the first A-ranked mission since the Land of the Waves.

 What is the Chunin Exam anyways?
 You really don't know anything, do you?
 Bro, if you pass the exam, you can become a Chunin from a Genin!
 I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!
 Heh!
 Hey! You thereΓÇª
 What's your name?
 Huh?  M-Me?
 No! The gourd next to you!
 I'm Gaara of the desertΓÇª
 I have an interest in you as wellΓÇª
 What's your name?
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Say! Say! What about me? What about me?
 Not interested.
 Heh! Things have gotten interesting.
 Konohamaru, do I look weak?
 Compared to Sasuke, yes...
 Sasuke, I won't lose to you!
 What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?!
 What do you think?
 I don't think they're anything special.
 But the black-haired one from Leaf Village and the gourd from the Sand VillageΓÇª
 those two need to be checked.
 Now then, in conjunction with beginning the Chunin Exam,
 let us first have those in charge of the rookie Genin come forward.
 Kakashi and Kurenai and AsumaΓÇª
 So?  Are there any Genin from your squads
 you wish to recommend for these exams?
 It goes without saying,
 but if it's a Genin who has carried out eight or more formal missions,
 you can recommend them for the exams if you wish.
 Well, as a general rule,
 having carried out more than twice that amount of missions is appropriate.
 There's no need to hear thisΓÇª
 It's too soon for them.
 Then, you first Kakashi.
 The Kakashi-led Group Seven...
 Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki. Sakura Haruno.
 I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these three for the Chunin Exam.
 Huh?
 The Kurenai-led Group Eight...
 Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka, Shino Aburame.
 These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi, recommend the same.
 The Asuma-led Group Ten...
 Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi.
 These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi, recommend the same.
 All three recommendedΓÇª
 To think rookies will be in the Chunin ExamΓÇª
 Hasn't it been five years since that's happened?
 HmmΓÇª
 Wait a minute!
 What is it, Iruka?
 Lord Hokage, please let me say one thing.
 This may be presumptuous,
 but as for the nine names that were given,
 I was in charge of them at the Academy.
 Admittedly, they were all students with ability,
 but it's too soonΓÇª!
 They should be tested after having gained more experience!
 I became a Chunin when I was six years younger than Naruto is now.
 Naruto is different from you!
 Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!
 They always do nothing but complain about important missionsΓÇª
 Teaching them a lesson once would be fun.
 Trying to crush them would be interesting, too.
 W-What did you say?!
 Well, joking asideΓÇª
 Iruka Sensei...
 I understand what you want to say.
 It's aggravating, I know. HoweverΓÇª
 Kakashi...
 Don't do it.
 Stay out of this! They're not your students anymore!
 Now they're my subordinates!
 ManΓÇªtroublesome people.
 B-But the Chunin Exam is also known asΓÇª
 IrukaΓÇª
 I understand your point.
 Master Hokage...
 Therefore, I have decided to conduct
 a special preliminary exam for these rookie Genins.
 P-Preliminary examΓÇª?!
 Say! Say! Say!
 Why is it that he's the one who always calls us out,
 and then makes us wait?!
 That's right! That's right!
 What's he going to do about the feelings of a maiden
 who accidentally overslept and resigned herself to no blow-drying?!
 I overslept, so I haven't washed my face and didn't brush my teeth.
 Y-YouΓÇªThat's dirty.
 Why're these guys so hyper first thing in the morning?!
 Hey, good morning, folks!
 Today, I got a bit lost on the path of lifeΓÇª
 Right! That's a lie!!
 Uh, wellΓÇª
 This is sudden, but I recommended you guys for the Chunin Exam, soΓÇª
 Here, these are your applications.
 Chunin ExamΓÇª
 That being said, the recommendations are not compulsory.
 You guys are free to decide whether you take the Exam or not.
 All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!
 Hey, cut it out. Get away alreadyΓÇª
 Only those who want to take the Exam, sign that application and
 come to Room 301 of the Academy at 3:00 p.m. five days from nowΓÇª
 That's it!
 Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!
 Chunin Exams, ehΓÇª
 I bet lots of strong guys would be thereΓÇª
 For example, that guy!
 And this guy!
 Okaaay! I won't lose to anybody no matter what!
 If I take the first place, the path to the Hokage is right there!
 Sure enough, it's decided that Naruto will be the HokageΓÇª
 I'll just retire my elderly self at once.
 Yaaaay!
 I might be able to fight him.
 I...don't want toΓÇª
 Here I can'tΓÇª
 keep up with Sasuke, and not even with NarutoΓÇª
 The Chunin Exam, no wayΓÇª
 Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!
 Sure. I don't have any missions today, so I'll play with you guys!
 Yaaay!
 Oh!
 Leader! Konohamaru!
 What're you going to do with Moegi?!
 Hey, you! Let Moegi go!
 Darn! Let's follow them, Konohamaru!
 Y-Yeah!
 W-Wait!
 Chunin Exams, ehΓÇª
 Yo.
 S-Sasuke, what's up?
 How about we go for a little walk?
 No way! For real?!
 Well well... So you can keep up at this speed, eh?
 Wait for me! Moegi!
 Bro, where'd you go?
 I think we are lost.
 Nooo! Let me go!
 Even the strongly fortified Village Hidden in the LeafΓÇª
 is mine if I slip in the middle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.
 Hmm?
 That was fastΓÇª
 Hey! You fat old man!
 What're you going to do with Moegi?
 What am I going to do, you ask?
 You want to know?
 Wha--?!
 Don't move!
 If you do, the brat's dead meat!
 Y-You. Why're you doing this?!
 I want the first Hokage's Scroll of Sealing!
 If you bring it to me, I'll return the brat!
 Scroll of SealingΓÇª
 UmmΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 What's up, all of a sudden?
 SakuraΓÇª
 Give up on the Chunin ExamΓÇª lt's too early for you.
 Is itΓÇª?
 I thought soΓÇª
 The Chunin Exam is a gathering of top dogsΓÇª
 You might die if you're not carefulΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 So you're worried about me, right?
 YeahΓÇªkind ofΓÇª
 What a display of affection, eh?
 Get lost! If you don't want to die.
 Don't talk as if you know everything!
 Don't make me angry!
 Sasuke!
 Don't take me lightly!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke?
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!!
 What're you doing?
 Hurry up and bring me the Scroll of Sealing!
 What'll happenΓÇªif I say, heck no?
 You don't care what happens to this brat?
 Heh, I'm fine with whatever happens to that bunch of straw, I say.
 Wha--?! When did he do that?!
 I've taken Moegi back from you, thank you!
 As expected great leader! Moegi respects you.
 Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huhΓÇª?
 You don't know when to give up!
 Naruto!
 Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru, I was scared.
 Oh, there-thereΓÇª
 Leader, did you catch him?
 Yup, as you can see!
 Huh?  What?!
 Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!
 Dang it! When did he switch?!
 I seeΓÇª
 If you don't want to turn out like this,
 you'll give up on the Chunin Exam, too.
 Sasuke, don't dieΓÇª!
 Big mistake if you think I'd say that.
 I was aware of this Genjutsu right from the start!
 What?!
 The real Sasuke wouldn't do something like
 invite me to go for a walk!
 Don't make me say such frustrating things!
 That kind of elementary Genjutsu won't work on me!
 Did you say elementaryΓÇª?
 That's right!
 Incidentally, I've seen through that you're also an illusion
 and aren't really here!
 I don't know aboutΓÇª
 that!
 See?
 Just what I'd expect of Kakashi's subordinate.
 However, this will become reality in the Chunin Exam!
 I wonder if you can endure thatΓÇª?
 I'm not scared! I'll take them on anytime!
 The Chunin Exam isn't... The Chunin Exam isn'tΓÇª!
 I'm still not sure if I can do itΓÇª
 That was a stupid thing to doΓÇª
 How was it?
 We went to the trouble of having a special preliminary exam,
 but all nine of the rookies passed.
 As you say, it appears their skills have definitely improved.
 Well, the actual Chunin Exam won't just end at this, but...
 Hey, have you heard?
 Rookies are going to be in the Chunin Exam
 for the first time in five years.
 No way.
 It's probably just a Jonin battle of wills or something anyway.
 NoΓÇª
 The story is that three among them are that Kakashi's unit.
 That's interestingΓÇª
 Well, be that as it mayΓÇª
 That's a sad storyΓÇª
 Sakura, you're late!
 YeahΓÇªsorryΓÇª
 Morning, Sasuke.
 YeahΓÇª
 Something's strange about Sakura.
 So, are you sure you're going to attempt taking
 the Chunin Exam with that skill?
 May it'd be best if you runts quit.
 You're green-assed brats, after all.
 Please let us through.
 That'sΓÇªmeanΓÇª
 What did you say?!
 Listen! We're being nice to you!
 The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.
 Many times have we seen people quit Shinobi
 as well as people who were disabled for life
 just because they took this Exam.
 Also, a Chunin is at the level of a unit leader.
 Mission failures, death of subordinates,
 it's all part of the responsibilities of a leader!
 A brat such as this a Chunin?
 What's so bad about weeding out those who won't pass anyway?!
 A just argument.
 However, you will let me through.
 And could you also immediately undo this barrier created with Genjutsu?
 I have business on the third floor.
 What's this guy talking aboutΓÇª?
 I don't knowΓÇª
 ΓÇô Well, wellΓÇª ΓÇô So you noticed, eh?
 How about it, Sakura?
 You should've been the first one to realize it.
 HuhΓÇª?
 Your analytical strength and Genjutsu know-how
 has improved the most in our squad, so...
 SasukeΓÇª
 Thank youΓÇª
 Of course. I realized it ages ago!
 You see, this is the second floor!
 Yup!
 Well, not badΓÇª But all you've done is to catch on.
 Right?!
 H-He's fast!
 This personΓÇª
 He's a different person from when he was getting punched before!
 He stopped my kickΓÇª
 What's with that Chakra in his arm?
 Hey, this isn't what you promised.
 You were the one who said
 you didn't want to carelessly attract attention and be watched.
 ButΓÇª
 Oh boyΓÇª 					This againΓÇª
 This guyΓÇª
 The marks where he was hit are disappearing.
 Was he faking?
 My name's Rock Lee. Your name's Sakura, rightΓÇª?
 Huh?
 Please go out with me! I'll protect you until I die!
 AbsolutelyΓÇªnot.
 Huh?
 You're... too intense.
 Hey, you there.
 Identify yourself.
 Dang it! Again?
 It's always about Sasuke!
 When asking someone his name, give your own name first.
 You're... a rookie, right? How old are you?
 I'm not obliged to answer.
 WhatΓÇª?
 Cute.
 Too intense, huhΓÇª
 Uninterested, huhΓÇª
 Now then! Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
 So those are Kakashi and Guy's treasured brats.
 Well, for the time being, their applications will pass.
 YeahΓÇª
 It appears this year's test-takers will be amusingΓÇª
 For us proctors too, eh.
 Good griefΓÇª
 This Chunin ExamΓÇª is full of monsters.
 Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashes and bushy eyebrows.
 Oh! It's you!
 You're the overly intense guy who just got rejected by Sakura.
 What's with your bizarre green jumpsuit?
 What? You want to challenge me, bushy-browed bumpkin?
 I'll teach you that it's a million years too soon to be doing that.
 Next episode:  ""Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!""
 As for me, I'm going to kick butt once again!

175,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 HasnΓÇÖt this increased since last month?
 Yes, it has.
 ItΓÇÖs now widely known in distant lands
 that you were appointed to Hokage, Lady Tsunade.
 Bills have started to come in addressed to the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 Hokage is not something to take on.
 My name is TsunadeΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm the Fifth Hokage of the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 My concern now is a debt that absolutely will not go downΓÇª
 AndΓÇª
 Grandma Tsunade!
 ΓÇô Hey wait! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 ΓÇô Lemme go! 					ΓÇô Calm down!
 If there arenΓÇÖt any missions, let me go search for Sasuke!
 YouΓÇÖve been told to train, havenΓÇÖt you, Naruto?!
 Grandma Tsunade!
 ThatΓÇª
 The Treasure Hunt is On!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you through!
 Goal!
 Too bad.
 But itΓÇÖs totally obvious since itΓÇÖs the same person doing it.
 There havenΓÇÖt been any missions lately, either.
 I wonder if the Pervy Sage will come back soonΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt train by myselfΓÇª
 What, there was someone here before me?
 Huh? KibaΓÇª AkamaruΓÇª
 Here I thought I could take my time to train.
 Are you by yourself? Where are Hinata and Shino?
 Shino is backing up another team with Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 Hinata said sheΓÇÖd train at home.
 Is it like weΓÇÖve lost our jobs?
 DonΓÇÖt say thatΓÇª IΓÇÖll feel empty-heartedΓÇª
 Naruto! Kiba!
 HinataΓÇª
 WerenΓÇÖt you training at home?
 There was a call from the Hokage. She wants us to come immediately.
 ThenΓÇª
 All right! Our first mission in a while!
 Treasure hunting?
 ThatΓÇÖs right. This person here, an old acquaintance of mine,
 is our client this time aroundΓÇª
 My name is Agari Kaisen.
 Please look at this.
 This is a map indicating the location of the treasure.
 It seems a treasure worth several hundred million ryo lies buried there.
 S-Several hundred million?!
 If I were to eat IchirakuΓÇÖs special portion ramen everydayΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt think you could eat all that even if you spent your whole life eatingΓÇª
 Awesome!
 But itΓÇÖs on the map, right?
 Is this a job to go to the trouble of asking Shinobi to do?
 Yes. The treasure is in a location difficult for ordinary people to get to.
 Even I tried getting thereΓÇª but there was no way.
 So itΓÇÖs the ShinobiΓÇÖs turn, huh?
 The deadline is in three days.
 If you succeed, there will be a special reward from Agari.
 Set out with caution!
 ΓÇô Yes! 					ΓÇô Yes!
 Heh! A mission like this is a cinch!
 Indeed, it isnΓÇÖt a difficult mission.
 HoweverΓÇª if you failΓÇª!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 ΓÇô Yay, yay! 					ΓÇô Hey, wait!
 If you failΓÇª
 you will go back to the Academy!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 YouΓÇÖll re-enroll in the Academy
 and re-do your Ninja training from square one.
 Wh-Why usΓÇª?
 I looked up your mission success rate over these past few monthsΓÇª
 Naruto! YouΓÇÖre decisively poor!
 What?!
 In particular, the success rate when you team up
 with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyuga is hopelessly low!
 Now that she mentions it,
 itΓÇÖs the members we failed an earlier mission withΓÇª
 We also failed before when four of us, including Shino,
 went looking for Bikochu BeetlesΓÇª
 Something rings familiar, right?
 But, just Naruto aside,
 why should we also have to go back to the AcademyΓÇª?
 Collective responsibility is fundamental in Ninja teams.
 Everyone takes responsibility for a failure.
 Got it?!
 ItΓÇªitΓÇÖll be okay. No way should we fail at hunting for treasureΓÇª
 If you donΓÇÖt drag us down.
 What?! DonΓÇÖt you be dragging us down!
 If we failΓÇª weΓÇÖll have to study with these kids, rightΓÇª?
 Hey, whatΓÇÖs up?
 Naruto, Kiba, Hinata, all three of you together?
 Iruka SenseiΓÇª
 You guys must have come to miss the Academy, huh?
 You could come back if you like.
 IΓÇÖll never go back!
 WhatΓÇÖs with themΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖll make this mission a success no matter what
 and put Grandma Tsunade to shame!
 And IΓÇÖll have no part of going backΓÇª
 to the Academy on account of associating with you.
 The failures until now are a collective responsibility.
 ItΓÇÖs not just my responsibility!
 I donΓÇÖt know about that.
 The success rate of our team without you in it is high.
 Then IΓÇÖll prove on this mission
 who it is who really drags us down, believe it!
 ThatΓÇÖs just what I want.
 I wonder if this will be okay?
 ItΓÇÖs a dead-end!
 So this is as far as thereΓÇÖs a path, huhΓÇª?
 ThereΓÇÖs a river up ahead. How should we cross itΓÇª?
 Then, here here. We should cut straight through, right?!
 Are you an idiot? Mountain terrain isnΓÇÖt that simple.
 I would goΓÇªthis way.
 Are you an idiot? ThatΓÇÖs totally the long way around.
 Then you want to compete to see which is faster?
 No way will I lose!
 All right! The finish line is that boulder!
 Start! LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru!
 This will be a cinch!
 What? What?
 Wait, Naruto!
 NarutoΓÇª
 What?
 It seems weΓÇÖre climbing up quite a bitΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okay!
 Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖsΓÇªokay.
 We should be totally faster than Kiba, soΓÇª!
 Yes! I win!
 Something smells goodΓÇª
 Huh?
 So you finally made it, huh?
 Kiba!
 You were so late I went ahead and got some food readyΓÇª
 Now thenΓÇª which way?
 We shouldΓÇª we should just cut right though this!
 Naruto!
 Good griefΓÇª
 W-WaterΓÇª
 Here, water.
 This wayΓÇÖs definitely faster!
 I sure slept well.
 Akamaru and I often train in mountains like thisΓÇª
 We know a lot more about the mountains than you guys.
 Shut up!
 Shut up, I say!
 DonΓÇÖt be acting all big just because you won two or three times!
 Not two or three times. Five times!
 S-Stop it! Naruto! Kiba!
 Naruto and the others should be there pretty soon, huhΓÇª?
 This mission looks easy at a glance.
 But it wonΓÇÖt go that easilyΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖll probably realize that.
 A limestone cave, huhΓÇª?
 ButΓÇª
 Geez, hurry up already!
 You said the buried treasure is in a limestone cave, right?
 Just a minute!
 The limestone cave is supposed to be further ahead.
 We shouldnΓÇÖt have been able to find it this easilyΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs not like there are that many limestone caves!
 So hereΓÇÖs fineΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Hinata.
 R-RightΓÇª
 H-Hey, wait, you two!
 I canΓÇÖt see anythingΓÇª
 Oh, itΓÇÖs a dead-endΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt be!
 Naruto! Hinata!
 Look out! Run, you two!
 Wha--?
 ThisΓÇªcouldnΓÇÖt be overΓÇª
 That person said itΓÇÖd be okay at just this extentΓÇª
 What happenedΓÇª?
 By any chance, was an enemy after us?
 NoΓÇªAkamaruΓÇÖs saying he didnΓÇÖt smell anyone.
 It was probably just an accidentΓÇª
 I told you this wasnΓÇÖt the right place!
 But, as a person, if youΓÇÖre looking for a limestone cave
 and thereΓÇÖs one right in front of you,
 one would usually think thatΓÇÖs the place, right?!
 DonΓÇÖt be getting smart with me. Here I saved your butt!
 I didnΓÇÖt ask you to save me.
 What?!
 HeyΓÇª you twoΓÇª
 A shard from the ceiling hit you, huhΓÇª?
 You okay?
 It seems IΓÇÖm the one dragging us downΓÇª
 Not at all! lf I had been more cautiousΓÇª
 At the end of the day, itΓÇÖs your fault, Naruto.
 Kiba!
 Nevertheless, IΓÇÖll have no part of going back to the Academy
 on account of associating with you, NarutoΓÇª
 Akamaru and I will find the treasure.
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying, Kiba?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no point if we donΓÇÖt all do it together!
 IΓÇÖmΓÇªokay, soΓÇª
 From here on, there will be locations all along the way so rough
 they are beyond comparison to those up until this pointΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖll be nothing but places that really only a Shinobi can get through!
 ItΓÇÖd be absolutely impossible for someone with an injured leg.
 OhΓÇª
 BesidesΓÇª we canΓÇÖt just leave someone whoΓÇÖs injured, right?
 We need someone to stay with her.
 Then it doesnΓÇÖt have to be meΓÇª
 Can you find the treasure by yourself?
 You canΓÇÖt read a map worth a damn and you donΓÇÖt know the mountainsΓÇª
 To be straightΓÇª
 weΓÇÖve wasted a ton of time on your account, so!
 Rest easy.
 After I find the treasure,
 you wonΓÇÖt have to go back to the AcademyΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Akamaru!
 H-Hey! Wait, Kiba!
 Damn itΓÇª!
 Now.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 Are you awake, Naruto?
 HinataΓÇª
 Naruto!
 There areΓÇªtwo Hinatas!
 NarutoΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu?
 Could it beΓÇª you were twins?!
 ΓÇô No! 					ΓÇô No!
 ThenΓÇª
 One of you transformed into Hinata with a Transformation Jutsu, huhΓÇª?
 I canΓÇÖtΓÇªtell you apart at allΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm the real one!
 IΓÇÖm the real one!
 Your voices are also exactly the same!
 I know.
 At a time like this,
 I should ask a question that only the real one knows.
 I'll come right out and ask! WhatΓÇÖs HinataΓÇÖs fatherΓÇÖs name?
 ΓÇô Hiashi Hyuga. ΓÇô Hiashi Hyuga.
 Oh, yeah. As for me, I didnΓÇÖt know HinataΓÇÖs fatherΓÇÖs name.
 What?!
 ΓÇô NarutoΓÇª 					ΓÇô NarutoΓÇª
 At a time like this, if Kiba and Akamaru were hereΓÇª
 Here they could tell by smell which one is the real oneΓÇª
 Nope. ItΓÇÖd be impossible even for a Ninja HoundΓÇª
 What?
 This isnΓÇÖt just an ordinary Transformation Jutsu, soΓÇª
 MisterΓÇªAs I recall, youΓÇÖre the client this time aroundΓÇª
 What are you doing here?
 It wasnΓÇÖt buried treasure that I wantedΓÇª
 It was your faces.
 FacesΓÇª?
 I already gotΓÇªyour faceΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm Naruto Uzumaki!
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªmeΓÇª
 I guess IΓÇÖll be setting out to get the last faceΓÇª
 Leave it to me!
 This is the placeΓÇª
 This inside of the cave is as the map saysΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no doubt.
 ItΓÇÖs under this rock, huh? IΓÇÖll go in one shot!
 Huh?
 This, huhΓÇª? I found it surprisingly easy.
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Kiba? ThatΓÇÖs you there, isnΓÇÖt it, Kiba?
 KibaΓÇª?
 NarutoΓÇªHinataΓÇª
 I told you guys to go on back first, didnΓÇÖt I?!
 Come on! Come on! Here we went to the trouble of coming!
 This mission is for the three of us, soΓÇª
 HinataΓÇª is your injury okay?
 YeahΓÇªI became able to move after resting a bit, soΓÇª
 Wow! You already found the treasure?!
 Then letΓÇÖs take it back to the village quick!
 RightΓÇª
 WaitΓÇª How did they get here so fast without a map?
 And moreover, Naruto has zero sense of directionΓÇª
 And Hinata has an injured legΓÇª
 AkamaruΓÇªdoesnΓÇÖt seem to be feeling any particular suspicion.
 Am I being paranoidΓÇª?
 It seems theyΓÇÖre back.
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Heh! DidnΓÇÖt we tell you?
 Even a Ninja Hound's nose canΓÇÖt tell the differenceΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs begin.
 Face Copying Jutsu!
 WhatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 We also copied faces like this.
 As you can see,
 when performing the Face Copying Jutsu,
 the person being copied must be close by.
 And moreover, it takes a degree of time.
 But once a face has been copied once, itΓÇÖs an impeccable Transformation Jutsu
 that is beyond even a familyΓÇÖs recognition.
 No wayΓÇª
 Kiba! Wake up! Kiba!
 Wh-What the hell are youΓÇª?!
 IΓÇÖm Kiba Inuzuka.
 You guysΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the big idea?!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 Those are the real ones, huhΓÇª?
 Who the hell are you guys?
 The name of our clan is the Kedouin Clan.
 WeΓÇÖre a clan that possesses the secret Face Copying Jutsu.
 Why our faces?
 WeΓÇÖre going to return to the Village Hidden in Leaves in your place,
 and mess up the village good!
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Like I said,
 nothing good ever comes from a mission together with you, Naruto.
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be complaining.
 TheyΓÇÖre intending to head for the village.
 Then, how do we get out of here?
 ΓÇô Listen. ΓÇô With Rasengan, IΓÇÖllΓÇª
 No good. TheyΓÇÖll notice.
 ΓÇô I canΓÇª ΓÇô Then use your Fang-Over-Fang.
 ΓÇô ItΓÇÖd be the same, you idiot. ΓÇô That's why I saidΓÇª
 ΓÇô Then, what do we do? ΓÇô Use that, IΓÇÖm telling youΓÇª
 Naruto!
 ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt stop me, Hinata. ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt stop me, Hinata.

168,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 ItΓÇÖs been a while since IΓÇÖve eaten Ichiraku ramen!
 Lately IΓÇÖve been away from home on missions.
 The bowl of ramen after a missionΓÇª
 it spreads to every muscle of the body and becomes energy for tomorrow.
 If you eat ramen it drives fatigue away.
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Temporarily closedΓÇª?
 No, it canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 I endured all the tough missions, looking forward to Ichiraku ramenΓÇª
 I can smell ramen!
 What?
 You're right!
 Without a doubtΓÇª Ramen is being made in there!
 Ramen!
 Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up! Burn Copper Pot Burn!
 This smellΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs the smell of a soup
 thatΓÇÖs never been on the Ichiraku menu before.
 ThenΓÇª It's temporarily closed to develop a new menu?
 WhoΓÇÖs there?!
 A large helping of miso char siu ramen! With an egg please.
 I seeΓÇª
 You were looking forward to my ramen that much.
 Sorry about that.
 ItΓÇÖs okay to develop a new menu,
 but I wish youΓÇÖd do it after the shop is closed.
 Since you came all this way. Give this a taste.
 Could this beΓÇª
 IchirakuΓÇÖs new menu?!
 LetΓÇÖs eat!
 Wait a minute!
 There are rules when youΓÇÖre eating a new ramen for the first timeΓÇª
 Rule ΓÖ¬1!
 Before you do anything,
 you must first have a sip to taste the soup.
 ΓÇô Delicious! 					ΓÇô Delicious!
 Next, you have to coat the noodles in soup and eat.
 Huh? It seems like something is missingΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs get to the point.
 The noodles are outdone by the soup!
 This well-seasoned, rich soup greatly surpasses
 any of IchirakuΓÇÖs previous soups!
 But! The noodles are the same as always!
 The balance is very bad.
 I cannot give it a passing score!
 ThatΓÇÖs what I thoughtΓÇª
 OhΓÇª DonΓÇÖt get so depressedΓÇª
 Ayame, water! Water please!
 Huh? WhereΓÇÖs Ayame?
 With ramen like thisΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll never be able to get Ayame back from the Ryonin.
 Teuchi!
 HeΓÇÖs just overtired.
 I had him drink an energy drink, so after a little rest he'll recover.
 ButΓÇª I think he should take a break from the shop for a while.
 HeΓÇÖs been using his arms too muchΓÇª
 Look how swollen this is.
 Come to think of it, before he fell,
 he said something about Ryonin or whatever
 did something to Ayame, I thinkΓÇª
 Ayame is his daughter, right?
 WhatΓÇÖs Ryonin?
 I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 RyoninΓÇª HeΓÇÖs referring to the Ninja Chef.
 Ninja Chef?
 Do you know about them, Choji?
 IΓÇÖve heard rumors about themΓÇª
 One of the problems ShinobiΓÇÖs confront on missions is the problem of meals!
 Normally Food Pills were brought with them,
 but the main role of those are to supply nutrients.
 They have no taste.
 If they could eat delicious food while on missions,
 would the success rate of missions rise?
 Based on that theory, was bornΓÇª
 The Ninja ChefΓÇª Ryonin!
 But what those Ninja Chef have to do with Ayame?
 They snatched her awayΓÇª
 What?!
 What are you talking about?!
 Give us the details!
 It was two weeks agoΓÇª
 Ichiraku Ramen
 Welcome!
 The large serving, hereΓÇÖs your order!
 A good job as always, Teuchi!
 Hakkaku!
 His name is Hakkaku,
 long ago we trained at the same ramen shopΓÇª
 He told me he is a Ninja Chef, a Ryonin, these days.
 ActuallyΓÇª I have a favor to ask you.
 What is it? If itΓÇÖs something I can do, I'll cooperate.
 The phantom recipe that I heard you developedΓÇª
 Please turn it over to me!
 Ph-Phantom recipe? What are you talking about?
 To a chef, a recipe is more precious than life!
 I understand why you want to hide it!
 ButΓÇª please! Give it to me!
 I really had no clue.
 But Hakkaku didnΓÇÖt believe meΓÇª
 Ayame. LetΓÇÖs get to work opening the shopΓÇª
 What theΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs this tray?
 Ayame!
 I have your daughter.
 If you want her back, hand over the ΓÇ£phantom recipe!ΓÇ¥
 Damn that Hakkaku!
 Why didnΓÇÖt you contact the Hokage right away!
 The Hokage couldΓÇª
 If I did that, I donΓÇÖt know what would happen to Ayame.
 And he also wrote this in the letterΓÇª
 That if I can serve them something impressive,
 heΓÇÖll give up on the phantom recipe and return my daughter safe.
 But, you've got a way to win?
 I donΓÇÖt know.
 But a chefΓÇÖs challenged me to a cooking match.
 I have no choice but to do it.
 So thatΓÇÖs why youΓÇÖre developing new ramen.
 I was able to make the soup exactly how I wanted to.
 ButΓÇªI just can't get the firm noodles that go with the soupΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt get Ayame back like this!
 The cooking match is tomorrowΓÇª What am I going to do?
 I canΓÇÖt imagine an Ichiraku without Ayame.
 Okay! Teuchi! WeΓÇÖll help you.
 WeΓÇÖll make the best ramenΓÇª
 And get Ayame backΓÇª
 From the Ryonin!
 You guysΓÇª
 I'll teach you the basics of making noodles.
 Quickly mix the ingredients evenly.
 If there are discrepancies,
 there will be variations in the taste of the noodles.
 NextΓÇª Knead it.
 If you donΓÇÖt put this properly the noodles wonΓÇÖt be firm.
 Are you okay?
 It's nothing. DonΓÇÖt worry about me.
 AndΓÇªstretch the noodles!
 ItΓÇÖs important for them to be of a uniform thickness!
 So there will be no differences after boilingΓÇª
 Try it.
 ItΓÇÖs easy to say itΓÇª
 but to actually make the noodles is not so easy.
 It takes five years to become an accomplished chef in his own right.
 To do it by the match tomorrow is completelyΓÇª
 When it comes down to it,
 IΓÇÖll have to give up this decrepit body of mine to them.
 TeuchiΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre not thinking about when you lose, are you?
 Th-ThatΓÇÖsΓÇª
 Because if we are doing this,
 weΓÇÖre doing it with the intention of winning, believe it!
 I absolutely don't forgive people who hold a girl captive!
 Cooking comes from the heart.
 Technique and experience arenΓÇÖt everything!
 No problemΓÇª
 WeΓÇÖll show them the real strength of the Shinobi of Leaf Village!
 Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku!
 The phantom recipe?
 You canΓÇÖt tell by looking at me?
 I see. How foolishΓÇª
 Let me tell you,
 ramen like the stuff I ate at your shop the other day can't win.
 Is Ayame okay?
 Father!
 Ayame!
 The emotional reunion comes after the match.
 I have a favor to ask. Let me have some helpers.
 I donΓÇÖt think those kids are up to the task, butΓÇª
 WellΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs okay.
 Well, letΓÇÖs start the cooking match!
 LetΓÇÖs see if you can satisfy all of us Ninja Chef!
 There are so many of themΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt have time to stand aroundΓÇª LetΓÇÖs begin!
 The preparation for the soup is done!
 IΓÇÖll prepare the ingredients for the rest!
 IΓÇÖm leaving the noodles to you!
 ΓÇô Okay! 					ΓÇô Okay!
 Listen. Our noodles determine whether Ayame will return or not!
 We cannot fail!
 Seems like heΓÇÖs done a good job with the soupΓÇª
 The delicious aroma is wafting over here.
 Indeed, itΓÇÖs whetting my appetite.
 The noodles are the problem!
 Can those kids really make noodles that will go with that soup?
 First, mix the ingredients!
 TheyΓÇÖre amateurs, I thought so!
 You canΓÇÖt make decent noodles with that hand movement!
 We practiced making noodles all night!
 But, we didnΓÇÖt make the noodles we wanted to by morningΓÇª
 Even so, we have to make perfect noodles!
 Hey hey. At least make us something edible!
 QuicklyΓÇª
 UniformlyΓÇª
 Without discrepancies!
 Next, knead it!
 Hey, Sakura!
 Look, itΓÇÖs Kakashi Sensei.
 DonΓÇÖt play!
 OhΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª
 Oww! Sakura, you just canΓÇÖt control your own crazy strength!
 ItΓÇÖs your fault for playing around at a time like this!
 This isΓÇª
 This isΓÇª the last of the ingredients.
 No problem. This time, let us show you weΓÇÖll succeed!
 Okay, IΓÇÖm mixing.
 Wait Choji! Leave this to me!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Hey, SakuraΓÇª
 Huh?
 We are Shinobi, right?
 So thenΓÇª LetΓÇÖs show them the Ninja way to make noodles!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengen! ΓÇ£IchirakuΓÇ¥ version!
 Wh-What?! Mixing ingredients with Chakra?!
 No, that way heΓÇÖll surely be able to mix the ingredients uniformly!
 And in micro units!
 Sakura!
 What?
 Pervy Sage.
 Naruto!
 Cha!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this crazy strengthΓÇª?!
 If she does that, the noodles will become super firm!
 Okay, Sakura!
 Choji!
 I, tooΓÇªam a Shinobi of Leaf Village!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands!
 What?!
 What outstanding noodles!
 If those noodles are added to TeuchiΓÇÖs soup, this match wouldΓÇª
 W-We cannot lose!
 ItΓÇÖs for the future of the Ninja Chef!
 Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi!
 Okay! Leave it to me!
 Wait a minute!
 When the ramen is doneΓÇª
 Who will you serve it to first?
 Huh? WhoΓÇª?
 Th-ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª ThatΓÇÖs how it is!
 ThatΓÇÖs how what is?
 Among the chefsΓÇª
 thereΓÇÖs a cardinal rule not to be forgotten.
 The first guest to arrive is the first guest served!
 No matter how delicious the food you make isΓÇª
 if you break this cardinal rule, youΓÇÖre disqualified as a chef!
 True, if a guy who came later were eating before me,
 then it would seriously pisses me off.
 There are 100 Ninja Chefs hereΓÇª
 They all showed up at about the same time!
 So you have to serve ramen to 100 people at the same time!
 YouΓÇÖre four peopleΓÇª
 Can you really serve at the same time?
 I said weΓÇÖre Ninja, didnΓÇÖt I?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What?!
 Now! Lift them!
 ΓÇô Thanks for waiting. Here you go! ΓÇô Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
 ΓÇô OhΓÇª 					ΓÇô OhΓÇª
 Th-The taste is the issue! lf you donΓÇÖt satisfy us, you lose!
 Delicious!
 ΓÇô Delicious! 					ΓÇô Delicious!
 IΓÇÖve never had ramen this delicious.
 So thenΓÇª
 We win!
 ΓÇô We did it! 					ΓÇô We did it!
 The truth isΓÇª
 We Ninja Chefs are at the end of our ropeΓÇª
 End of your rope?
 What do you mean by that?
 We endeavored to make delicious meals to eat during missionsΓÇª
 We thought to make delicious food, to fill your stomachΓÇª
 that can be eaten anywhereΓÇª
 But we pursued taste too far.
 It was too delicious, people were compelled to overeat.
 And as a resultΓÇª
 Ninja gained weight, and it interfered with their missions.
 And some people are now saying,
 ΓÇ£we donΓÇÖt need the Ninja Chefs anymore.ΓÇ¥
 ΓÇô OhΓÇª 					ΓÇô OhΓÇª
 For us Ninja Chefs to continue,
 we had to get our hands on the ΓÇ£phantomΓÇ¥ recipe out there
 in the cooking world!
 Recipe?
 If we use this recipe,
 we can improve the performance of Shinobi without causing a burden.
 ThereΓÇÖs such recipeΓÇª?
 I hear, itΓÇÖs called ΓÇ£the scum recipe.ΓÇ¥
 ΓÇô The scum recipe?! ΓÇô The scum recipe?!
 We've gathered information from everywhereΓÇª
 As a result,
 we learned that the scum recipe was at ""Ichiraku"" which Teuchi run.
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô What?!
 I-I donΓÇÖt know!
 ThereΓÇÖs no reason something like that should be at my shop!
 ThereΓÇÖs someone who heard it!
 I've got ""the scum recipe"" at my shop, soΓÇª
 OhΓÇª TeuchiΓÇª?
 Oh. I might have that.
 Are you serious?!
 I thought so!
 To be preciseΓÇª ltΓÇÖs the ΓÇ£scum removal recipe.ΓÇ¥
 ΓÇô Scum removal? ΓÇô Scum removal?
 The trick to making delicious soupΓÇª
 is how well you remove the scum.
 So I, too, studied a lot.
 Eventually, I worked out a recipe that can remove the scum effectively.
 Usually it's called ΓÇ£the scum recipeΓÇ¥ for shortΓÇª
 I never thought that this misunderstanding would arise.
 ThatΓÇÖs a pretty big omission.
 Geez. ThatΓÇÖs a stupid punch lineΓÇª
 We won the cooking match,
 so keep your promise and return Ayame!
 ThatΓÇÖs right! Where is she?!
 Father!
 AyaΓÇªme?
 AyameΓÇªis that you?
 CanΓÇÖt you tell by looking?
 B-But Ayame is likeΓÇª
 The food they make is so delicious, I overeatΓÇª
 Did I gain that much weight?
 Ayame!
 IchirakuΓÇÖs new menu?
 The thing we made at the cooking challenge?
 No, a diet ramen thatΓÇÖs popular among girls.
 Diet Ramen?
 ItΓÇÖs super popular!
 Oh, come on in, Naruto.
 YouΓÇÖve regained your former shapeΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs thanks to my fatherΓÇÖs diet ramen!
 Huh? Where's your father?
 WellΓÇª While he was joining me in eating the diet ramenΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª Naruto.
 ThatΓÇÖs a little too thin, believe it.
 The wind blows, AhΓÇª
 The pain, The memories wonΓÇÖt disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, AhΓÇª
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Does anyone have anything to ask about this mission?
 IΓÇÖve got a question!
 Why should I have to go on a mission with this group?
 Okay, letΓÇÖs move on. Everyone ready?
 Hey, IΓÇÖve got a question, believe it!
 As for the mission details,
 weΓÇÖre to eliminate the Demon of the Ocean in the Land of Oceans.

 heΓÇÖs not someone we can easily defeatΓÇª
 If we take our time, Sasuke will pass the borders.
 If that happens, we wonΓÇÖt be able to handle this on our own.
 So we split upΓÇª one team to stop him
 and one to go after Sasuke, right?
 Yeah. The sub leader is going to be you, Neji.
 I found them!
 Neji! Take Kiba and Choji, and go after Sasuke!
 Got it!

 Naruto and I will handle!
 Are you going to put the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu on me again?

 ShikamaruΓÇª That pill that Choji took earlier..
 It seemed like some sort of trump card,
 but does he have a chance to win?
 He said that he has a secret weapon.
 He brought the Akimichi clanΓÇÖs ultimate secret pills on this missionΓÇª
 These are the Triad Colored Pills of green, yellow, and red.
 If you take it, you can gain explosive powers.
 The energy that each pill contains is enormous!
 I see! I see! So thatΓÇÖs why he was so confident!
 ButΓÇªthereΓÇÖs always a side effect to any pills that work too well.
 DamnΓÇª I didnΓÇÖt think it would hurt so much with just the Spinach Pill.
 I hope that Choji can settle it with just the green pill.
 DonΓÇÖt take the red one, no matter what, Choji.
 IΓÇÖm going to finish you at once!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Spiky Human Boulder.
 He raised the rotational and destructive power

 I-I did itΓÇª?
 Yeah. ThatΓÇÖs what I was thinking too.
 AkamaruΓÇª 					What is he saying?
 You know that Akamaru can tell the strength of the enemy
 just by the smell, right?
 HeΓÇÖs worried if Choji is going to be able to handle that monster with just the pills.
 TrueΓÇª
 If we were to assess the situation objectively,
 that giantΓÇÖs ability is unknownΓÇª
 The possibility of Choji being able to defeat him might be close to zero.
 ButΓÇª
 That is how battle isΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt get carried away, loser!
 Shatter Palm!
 Did you know?
 When thereΓÇÖs a group of people of five or so,
 thereΓÇÖs always one loser.
 That person is always made fun ofΓÇª
 and when it comes down to it,
 theyΓÇÖll just toss that person aside like a pawn.
 IΓÇÖm talking about you!
 Choji. All you want to do is eat. You should train some at least!
 You get teased because youΓÇÖre like that. YouΓÇÖre just a f--
 You said somebody exceptional, right?
 ShouldnΓÇÖt we ask Shino or somebody?!
 This guy is useless tooΓÇª
 That is trueΓÇª
 No matter how hard I try on my ownΓÇª
 IΓÇª
 Seems like I hit it right on the nose.
 Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,
 seeing that they pick a loser like you to be on the pursuit team.
 Why donΓÇÖt we finish this up already?!
 Knee Lift!
 Shoulder Charge!
 Huh! You really are a loser to the end!
 Your high spirit didnΓÇÖt last long at all, only at the beginningΓÇª!
 You really are the ideal loser!
 A loser like you shouldnΓÇÖt have come to a place like this!
 You should blame your stupid leader for choosing you!
 ShikamaruΓÇª
 NejiΓÇÖs right. ItΓÇÖs how a battle is.
 From the start, this mission wasnΓÇÖt for recreation.
 ItΓÇÖs life or death.
 Hey ShikamaruΓÇª
 I already anticipated the worst scenario
 in which we would be fighting separately on our own.
 And at this point,
 if weΓÇÖre not prepared for ΓÇ£one person, one kill,ΓÇ¥
 we might not be able to catch up to Sasuke.
 Choji is a good guy, but he doesnΓÇÖt have the confidence.
 He thinks that heΓÇÖs the weakest of all of us.
 He actually is weak. Anybody can see that.
 ThatΓÇÖs why he was the first to stay behind to try to be useful.
 Just as I thoughtΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 Choji and I have worked as a team for many years,
 so coordinating with him is easiest for me.
 But ShikamaruΓÇª
 But, if we fight against each other, you might be stronger.
 I might have given up fighting against you too.
 And youΓÇÖre youΓÇª
 ButΓÇª
 ShikamaruΓÇªhas alwaysΓÇª
 Shikamaru has always believed in meΓÇª
 ChojiΓÇªare you ready?!
 He believed that I was really strong!
 ThatΓÇÖs why he left it up to me alone!
 Just as I thoughtΓÇª
 So everybody thinks thatΓÇª ButΓÇªI knowΓÇª
 More than myself or Neji or any of us hereΓÇª
 He is stronger!
 AndΓÇªI believe it.
 Oh? Pretty impressive Chakra.

 about trying to destroy the Kurama Clan!
 Yakumo, youΓÇÖve got the wrong idea.
 You lie!
 No way could my mother and father die in just a fire!
 My parents were killedΓÇª!
 What?!
 ShinoΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 All right!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you guys!
 ΓÇôRight! 					ΓÇôRight!
 Now, IΓÇÖm ready when you areΓÇª
 One, twoΓÇª
 Charge!
 Go!
 N-NarutoΓÇª
 Naruto?!
 Kurenai Sensei! What happened to yourΓÇª?
 Yakumo, did you do thisΓÇª?
 That person tried to eliminate meΓÇª
 So sheΓÇÖs just facing the consequences.
 YouΓÇÖre wrong!
 Yakumo, youΓÇÖve misunderstood something.
 I heard everything about you and Kurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai.
 Stop, Naruto!
 Listen up. Kurenai Sensei sealed your powers
 because she cares about you!
 WhatΓÇÖre you talking about?!
 YouΓÇÖre not the only one whoΓÇÖs suffering!
 Kurenai Sensei hid the truth all this time and has suffered alone!
 Stop!
 TheΓÇªtruthΓÇª?
 The Supposed Sealed Ability
 Guy Sensei!
 Hey, where is everyone?!
 Shino and Hinata are standing watch in the hallway,
 but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto
 are now inside the world created by YakumoΓÇÖs Genjutsu!
 Huh? What do you mean?!
 IΓÇÖll explainΓÇª
 Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy.
 NoΓÇª I must now explain the truthΓÇª
 Nobody has taken such affectionate care of Yakumo as Kurenai.
 KurenaiΓÇÖs resolve was to get Yakumo to give up on being a ShinobiΓÇª
 Yakumo was completely in low spirits.
 Lord Murakumo was also concernedΓÇª
 Then one day, that incident occurredΓÇª
 The residence of the head family burned to the ground
 and Yakumo stood motionless in front of itΓÇª
 I saw it at that timeΓÇª
 The form of a monster with a face like a female demon
 hovering in the flamesΓÇª!
 After learning of its identityΓÇª I became frozen with terror.
 What isΓÇªthe truth?!
 SenseiΓÇª What the heck is happening to YakumoΓÇª?
 This is badΓÇª!
 Yakumo! You donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª
 You donΓÇÖt know anything!
 SomethingΓÇÖsΓÇª YesΓÇª
 There is somethingΓÇª in the recesses of my mindΓÇª
 ButΓÇª What is itΓÇª? I canΓÇÖt rememberΓÇª
 Oh noΓÇª!
 Naruto, stop that!
 Huh?!
 Naruto!
 What is this thing?! Damn it. Let me go!
 All I want to do is live up to everyoneΓÇÖs expectations, and yours.
 And yetΓÇª Why does everyone get in my way?
 I just want to become a Genjutsu userΓÇª
 People have their respective appropriate paths.
 You probably have your own path.
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to force yourself to become a ShinobiΓÇª
 NoΓÇª I donΓÇÖt want that!
 Everyone may comfort me with wordsΓÇª
 But I know. I know theyΓÇÖre disappointed in me.
 I canΓÇÖt stand having to live my whole life feeling that burden.
 Yakumo, whatΓÇÖs thatΓÇª?
 R-Run, Uroko!
 Yakumo!
 I rememberΓÇª
 YakumoΓÇª?!
 YesΓÇªmeΓÇª
 The person inside me killed my mother and fatherΓÇª!
 I killed them with Genjutsu!
 No, Yakumo! That wasnΓÇÖt youΓÇª
 You and that monster are different!
 No, weΓÇÖre not differentΓÇª
 You see, that thingΓÇª was living inside my heart.
 ThanksΓÇª Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 GoodbyeΓÇª
 Stop!
 Yakumo!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖsΓÇªthatΓÇª?!
 In order for us to get a clear picture of the incident,
 we first requested a complete examination of YakumoΓÇª
 As a result, we learned the monster that appeared at the time of the fire
 was an Id Monster so to speak, created by YakumoΓÇÖs sub-consciousness.
 An IdΓÇªMonsterΓÇª
 Then I made a direct appeal to the Third HokageΓÇª
 Ultimately, Yakumo could not endure the weight
 of living up to our expectations from the time she was little
 and that triggered her sub-consciousness to attempt to expunge everything.
 YakumoΓÇÖs sub-consciousness will probably attempt to
 expunge the Kurama Clan and eventually the entire Leaf Village.
 I cannot consent to thatΓÇª
 Despite such a risk,
 taking the life of Yakumo who has no awareness of evil cannot be allowed!
 ItΓÇÖll be too late
 once her sub-consciousness completely awakens!
 Then we just have to get her to learn how to control it herselfΓÇª
 or seal her powers if thatΓÇÖs not possible.
 ButΓÇª
 Although slightly different from YakumoΓÇÖs caseΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs a precedent of a baby being used to seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.
 ThatΓÇÖs absurdΓÇª!
 There isnΓÇÖt a Jutsu practitioner
 who can seal the strong powers Yakumo possessesΓÇª
 There might be just one person who can accomplish thatΓÇª
 However, it will become a painful mission.
 Hopefully, this person can teach her how to control her powersΓÇª
 But if it comes to sealing her powers,
 the Jutsu practitioner will end up erasing all the potential in the childΓÇª
 The Jutsu practitioner will have to live with the burden
 of YakumoΓÇÖs resentment in place of the Kurama ClanΓÇª
 The Third Hokage said that and then cried.
 The one who accepted that painful mission wasΓÇª
 Yuhi Kurenai.
 I seeΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs what Kurenai Sensei was talking about.
 IΓÇªdidnΓÇÖt know anything about SenseiΓÇª
 I knew that Kurenai had sealed YakumoΓÇÖs powersΓÇª
 But itΓÇÖs the first time IΓÇÖve heard
 about the incident her sub-consciousness caused.
 YesΓÇª The Third Hokage passed away
 and at this point, itΓÇÖs a secret known only to the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai.
 She made herself into the bad guy and kept the secret, huhΓÇª?
 Kurenai SenseiΓÇª!
 You go, too!
 ΓÇôButΓÇª 					ΓÇôSakuraΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll take over things hereΓÇª!
 Guy SenseiΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre concerned about Naruto and the others, right?
 Go to themΓÇª!
 Right!
 I leave YakumoΓÇªto youΓÇª
 What is itΓÇª?
 I donΓÇÖt knowΓÇª ButΓÇª
 This feelingΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs somehow entirely different from beforeΓÇª
 My insects are acting strange.
 WhatΓÇÖs going on inside?! ls Kurenai Sensei okay?
 ItΓÇÖs powerfulΓÇª
 A massive Chakra beyond compare is being producedΓÇª!
 NarutoΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª? Why do you have to take your own lifeΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇª?!
 What must be destroyed are the ones
 who forced you to shoulder a heavy burden
 and on top of that, tried to eliminate meΓÇª!
 WhoΓÇÖre youΓÇª?
 I crept into an opening in the depths of your mind and was nurtured.
 My name is IdΓÇª!
 SheΓÇÖs finally awokenΓÇª
 Kurenai Sensei, what is that thing?
 It happened soon after I was made YakumoΓÇÖs personal instructor.
 It was when I had doubts about the high level of YakumoΓÇÖs Genjutsu
 and looked into her deep psyche.
 I discovered that thing!
 I could only stand motionless in front of that terrible figure.
 It wasnΓÇÖt Yakumo whom the Third Hokage said to eliminateΓÇª
 It was her Id monsterΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs what it wasΓÇª?
 This ominous ghastlinessΓÇª is more powerful than before.
 But I must stop it from getting into the real world,
 even if we have to kill each otherΓÇª!
 Kill each other?! 					I seeΓÇª
 She was that determinedΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs why she quit Squad Eight.
 IΓÇÖll take your feelings into this body and settle the scoreΓÇª
 You jerk!
 YouΓÇÖre in the way. Move it!
 Naruto!
 I donΓÇÖt know what the heck you areΓÇª
 But Kiba, Shino, Hinata, theyΓÇÖre all waiting for SenseiΓÇÖs return!
 NarutoΓÇª!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 My Jutsu wonΓÇÖt activate in this worldΓÇª!
 You are a thorn in my sideΓÇª IΓÇÖll erase you first.
 Look out!
 Yakumo, youΓÇÖre the only one who can defeat it now!
 WhatΓÇª?
 Listen, YakumoΓÇª All people have a fanged beast in their mindsΓÇª
 It always lives in the depths of a personΓÇÖs mind
 and will suddenly appear.
 The power of the beast that appears is enormous and
 regardless of oneΓÇÖs own will, it can inadvertently hurt those around it.
 ButΓÇªif that monster can be tamed
 and then controlled with oneΓÇÖs own powerΓÇª
 It becomes a magnificent power
 and acts to make your dreams come true.
 Now, fight!
 Abate by your own hand the monster you created!
 B-ButΓÇª
 Yakumo, only you can do this!
 Die, boyΓÇª
 Darkness in my mind, abate!
 Die!
 WhyΓÇª? 					IΓÇªservedΓÇªyou wellΓÇª
 Kurenai Sensei, youΓÇÖre back to normal!
 KurenaiΓÇªSenseiΓÇª
 You did well, YakumoΓÇª You defeated your own darkness.
 SenseiΓÇª
 You did it, YakumoΓÇª
 YakumoΓÇª
 She knew exactly who was really trying to save herΓÇª
 ΓÇôKurenai Sensei! 					ΓÇôSenseiΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs okay now!
 Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖll go back to being everyoneΓÇÖs teacher, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 My final mission from the Third Hokage is overΓÇª
 ΓÇôSensei! 					ΓÇôSensei!
 ThatΓÇÖs great that things could get back to normalΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇª!
 NarutoΓÇª?
 I will too.

 Why do we have to get all worn out for someone like him?
 Exactly! We were told to protect the Beauty of Nature,

 Plus, he uses people as scapegoats and shields.
 He thinks itΓÇÖs only natural for Shinobi to die in missions.

 Our two hearts
 No wayΓÇª
 To think Old Man Hokage would try to eliminate Yakumo.
 No way could that ever happen!
 But if by some remote chance,
 Kurenai Sensei accepted such a missionΓÇª
 it would explain her strange behavior.
 No, no way! No way that could ever happen.
 Are you okay, Kurenai SenseiΓÇª?
 Yes. I feel quite a bit better now thanks to your first-aidΓÇª
 Who in the world is Kurenai Sensei protecting?
 It was the Third Hokage who told her to take custody of YakumoΓÇª
 What in the world is her real missionΓÇª?
 What's going on?!
 Th-That'sΓÇª
 Th-The Village Hidden in the Leaves isΓÇª
 No wayΓÇª!
 Genjutsu or Reality?
 ItΓÇÖs like the aftermath of a large war that broke out.
 Hinata!
 RightΓÇª
 Byakugan!
 ThereΓÇÖs not a person in the villageΓÇª
 What is thisΓÇª?
 WhatΓÇÖs going on here?!
 Kiba, HinataΓÇª ls there anything unusual in the area?
 No enemy signs anywhereΓÇª
 Akamaru doesnΓÇÖt sense the scent of any outsiders, either.
 What happened in the village while we were awayΓÇª?
 First, letΓÇÖs take Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei to the hospital.
 WeΓÇÖll check out the village after thatΓÇª
 R-RightΓÇª!
 Leaf Hospital
 WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?
 Anyway, letΓÇÖs get these two to a hospital roomΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm okay. More importantly, take care of Yakumo.
 RightΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre out of danger nowΓÇª
 Oh, noΓÇªSheΓÇÖs unconscious!
 Her vital signs are weakeningΓÇª
 I wonder if thereΓÇÖs any medicine leftΓÇª
 Naruto, help me lookΓÇª
 Oh, well, butΓÇª
 Just hurry!
 R-RightΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no scent of blood.
 Everyone must have evacuated somewhere.
 LetΓÇÖs us check out the village.
 RightΓÇª
 Make sure you three always act togetherΓÇª
 Come back here in thirty minutes, no matter what.
 RightΓÇª
 What is it?
 Sure enough, you have to be the one to give us orders, Kurenai Sensei!
 WhatΓÇÖs been the matter with you?!
 The pharmacy is that way.
 Nothing. I was just concerned about Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 So letΓÇÖs hurry and get the medicine!
 I mean, Kurenai SenseiΓÇÖs going toΓÇª eliminateΓÇªYakumoΓÇª
 Eliminate?
 Th-Th-That couldnΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 I was just kind of out of it.
 Huh?
 HuhΓÇª? What was that?!
 What is it, Sakura?!
 ThereΓÇÖs someone here other than us.
 What?!
 ThatΓÇÖs close!
 IΓÇÖll leave the two in the hospital room to you, Sakura!
 IΓÇÖm going after him!
 Got it!
 Hold it! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Huh?! My Jutsu wonΓÇÖt activate?!
 Wait! This isnΓÇÖt the time to be fighting.
 You guys are the ones who attacked the mountain cottage, right?!
 I am Unkai of the Kurama ClanΓÇª
 Kurama?! The same clan as Yakumo?!
 Why would her clan attack her?!
 Listen to me! lf you donΓÇÖt, everyone will die!
 What's this smell of blood?!
 Byakugan!
 Close your Byakugan, Hinata!
 Kiba, restrain AkamaruΓÇÖs sense of smell!
 ΓÇôWhat?! 					ΓÇôWhat is it?!
 ItΓÇÖs because weΓÇÖre caught in someoneΓÇÖs Jutsu.
 Say what?!
 Yes. WeΓÇÖre now inside YakumoΓÇÖs Genjutsu.
 It may seem as if the Leaf Village was in a war.
 But this is merely a part of her Genjutsu.
 This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsu and weΓÇÖve all been trapped in it?
 ThatΓÇÖs totally impossible!
 But if her latent powers have awakened, it wouldnΓÇÖt be hard at all.
 This whole village?!
 This ground weΓÇÖre standing on, this sky, everything is Genjutsu?!
 There are occasions when superior senses become a hindrance.
 ItΓÇÖs because no matter how superior the sense of sight or smell might be,
 ultimately itΓÇÖs the human brain that processes and perceives the information!
 There are times when well-developed brains make errors
 in the process of interpreting complex electric signals.
 However, insects act only with sharp senses.
 Unlike the information processed with a human brain,
 insects narrow this information down to the very minimum.
 Look. My insects are still under control.
 They will not be deceived.
 There are occasions when
 YakumoΓÇÖs Genjutsu summons thunderclouds
 and produces fire.
 And that is planted directly into the human brain
 as if it had occurred in reality.
 And that causes the brain to hurt oneΓÇÖs own body.
 Then, GrandmaΓÇÖs houseΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs also YakumoΓÇÖs power?!
 ItΓÇÖs not just thatΓÇª
 She can even kill people easily if she were so inclined.
 But these tremorsΓÇª
 Are you saying this is also Genjutsu?
 YouΓÇÖll see any moment nowΓÇª
 A-A snake!
 ItΓÇÖs too huge!
 Is that also Genjutsu?!
 ItΓÇÖs a terrifying image that our cerebrums have created.
 Physical influence is absolutelyΓÇª
 unthinkable!
 No way!
 Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?!
 Huh?!
 ReallyΓÇª? Yakumo can kill people with Genjutsu..?
 So is that why the Third Hokage tried to eliminate her?
 Yakumo, Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 Over hereΓÇª Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 I still canΓÇÖt believe it.
 To think Yakumo would do something like that!
 Once every several generations,
 a child is born into our Kurama Clan with physical idiosyncrasies.
 That child is YakumoΓÇª
 Moreover, whatΓÇÖs terrifying is her using her powers unconsciously
 without being able to control it.
 ItΓÇÖs getting kind of hot.
 DonΓÇÖt!
 WhatΓÇÖs happening outside the doorΓÇª?
 DonΓÇÖt open it!
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs thisΓÇª?
 WhyΓÇÖs there lava hereΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs an illusion our brains have created due to YakumoΓÇÖs Genjutsu.
 But even itΓÇÖs an illusion, if we were to dive into the lava,
 our brains would determine it to be lava and our bodies would burn up.
 That is YakumoΓÇÖs power.
 So is that why Old Man Hokage and Kurenai Sensei
 tried to eliminate Yakumo?
 ThatΓÇÖs not it.
 What they really attempted to kill
 was the monster existing inside Yakumo.
 A monster?
 Before too long, YakumoΓÇÖs massive powers
 created a terrifying monster.
 If left alone, the monster that continues to grow would
 someday attempt to become one with her
 by absorbing YakumoΓÇÖs consciousness.
 The Third Hokage and Kurenai determined as such
 and all there was to do in order to save Yakumo was to seal her powers.
 A monster in her bodyΓÇª
 So thatΓÇÖs what it wasΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt just sit back like this!
 Oh!
 Oh. My entire fortune!
 I told you. If you dive into the lava, youΓÇÖre body will really burn up.
 Then does that mean we canΓÇÖt get out of here?!
 No, there is one way.
 WhatΓÇÖs that way?!
 If you seal your five senses, the Genjutsu cannot affect the body.
 You must escape from this world and attack Yakumo!
 What?! Attack Yakumo?!
 Ow-ow-ow!
 What? This isΓÇªSatomi Hill?!
 Old Man Unkai!
 It seems you safely made it out of YakumoΓÇÖs GenjutsuΓÇª
 What the heck happenedΓÇª?!
 At the point you brought Yakumo out of the mountain cottage,
 you were already caught in her Genjutsu.
 What?!
 Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!
 Kiba!
 Shino!
 Wh-Where are weΓÇª?
 Sakura, examine Old Man UnkaiΓÇÖs wounds.
 UnkaiΓÇª?
 What happened?! These are awful burns!
 We were able to get out of YakumoΓÇÖs Genjutsu
 thanks to this old man!
 Rather, IΓÇÖd say we were driven outΓÇª
 Her only target was Yuhi Kurenai, after allΓÇª
 WhereΓÇÖs Kurenai Sensei now?
 Well, probablyΓÇª
 YakumoΓÇª
 Kurenai SenseiΓÇª What do you think of my paintingsΓÇª?
 ArenΓÇÖt they wonderful?!
 What did you do to everyone?
 DonΓÇÖt worryΓÇª I just drove out the intrudersΓÇª
 Eventually, I must have my revenge on the Leaf VillageΓÇª
 But first, I have some business with you, Sensei.
 Why include the Leaf Village as wellΓÇª?
 I should be enough of a target for your revengeΓÇª!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you say you donΓÇÖt know!
 How is it? 					Awesome, huh?
 I have complete control now of letting you live or killing you, Sensei.
 Tell me the truthΓÇª
 It was the Third Hokage who ordered my father and mother killed and
 the Kurama Clan and me eliminated from the Leaf Village, right?
 No.
 The Third Hokage did not order such a missionΓÇª
 Why do you lie?!
 Please.
 Tell me the truth!
 YouΓÇÖll vanish if you donΓÇÖt, Kurenai SenseiΓÇª
 Such a sad childΓÇª
 If killing me will eliminate your suffering, then you should do it.
 If your hate will vanish along with your suffering!
 Why do you cry? I wonΓÇÖt be deceived by tears like that!
 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005!
 Yeah, it feels good in every kind of weather to sweat.
 So the Kurama Clan are still here! Might Guy will take you on!
 W-Wait, Guy!
 Huh?! G-Guy?
 I see. So you guys were also caught in the Kurama GenjutsuΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry.
 Well, youΓÇÖre alive and thatΓÇÖs all that matters.
 Thank goodness, thank goodness.
 Oh, you guys are back!
 Where are the village reinforcements?!
 ThereΓÇÖs no time to explain!
 What?!
 Oh, hey! Wait, you guys!
 WhatΓÇÖs up with them?!
 WhoΓÇÖs that manΓÇª? And what about everyone?
 Please, just help me out, Guy Sensei.
 But, wellΓÇª
 Just hurry!
 R-RightΓÇª

 No, Yakumo!
 Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei are in the innermost room.

 2,000 punches!
 If I canΓÇÖt, itΓÇÖs 2,000 jump ropes!
 You recklessly practiced only Taijutsu and eventuallyΓÇª
 All right, youΓÇÖve all become Genin as of today,
 so IΓÇÖd like to know what it is youΓÇÖre all aiming for!
 Yes, yes, yes, yes!
 Tenten.
 IΓÇÖd like to become a powerful Ninja like the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!
 Hmm...
 And, how about you, Neji?
 I donΓÇÖt want to answerΓÇª
 IΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖd like to prove that I could become a respectable Ninja
 even though I canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Those are good serious eyesΓÇª
 Humph!
 You!
 WhatΓÇÖs so funny?!
 IΓÇÖm serious!
 I will become a respectable Ninja even only with Taijutsu!
 He should give up alreadyΓÇª
 At this rateΓÇª
 He will simply die with Gaara just toying with himΓÇª
 Bushy BrowsΓÇª!
 LeeΓÇª
 Not yetΓÇª Not yet!
 Lee, you just wonΓÇÖt learn your lesson, will you?
 ThereΓÇÖs no way you can winΓÇª
 Unlike you, Neji is a genius.
 A geniusΓÇª?
 What is a genius?!
 Even though I may not have talent, IΓÇÖll exceed genius with my efforts.
 That is my entire being!
 That is my Way of the Ninja!
 YouΓÇÖll get nowhere, LeeΓÇª
 No matter how much effort you make,
 thereΓÇÖs no way you can take me down.
 ThatΓÇÖs simply a fact.
 That's not true!
 ThatΓÇÖs notΓÇª
 But youΓÇªrefused to give up, not ever!
 Such meaningless actionsΓÇª
 The Bowl-Cut was unlucky to have Gaara as his opponent!
 NoΓÇª
 LeeΓÇÖs not one to give up with this much.
 ΓÇô What? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 The reason is that LeeΓÇª
 The reason is that LeeΓÇª
 YouΓÇªcontinued to make effort.
 If I canΓÇÖt jump rope 1,200 times, IΓÇÖll log kick 2,000 times!
 1,116... 1,117...!
 1,118... 1,11--!
 Huh?!
 Lee!
 Are you taking a break already?
 Guy SenseiΓÇª
 What is it that you want?
 If itΓÇÖs about my blunder with the recent assignment,
 I believe IΓÇÖve apologized.
 LeeΓÇª ItΓÇÖs true youΓÇÖre different from Neji.
 You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills, and youΓÇÖre not a Taijutsu genius eitherΓÇª
 But Lee...
 you have powers that exceed NejiΓÇª
 youΓÇÖre a genius with hidden potential.
 If youΓÇÖre trying to make me feel better, please stop!
 Idiot!
 IΓÇÖm not trying to make you feel better or anything!
 The reason is that you areΓÇª
 a genius of effort!
 I wonder ifΓÇª
 If thatΓÇÖs trueΓÇª?
 I'veΓÇªIΓÇÖve believed that to be trueΓÇª
 That if I trained harder than NejiΓÇª 2 or 3 times as muchΓÇª
 that IΓÇÖd surely become stronger.
 But...
 IΓÇÖve recently begun to think thatΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt beat a real genius.
 Is effort really rewardedΓÇª?
 IΓÇÖve wanted to know this and
 so IΓÇÖve taken on Neji, but itΓÇÖs always been the sameΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖm no match for him at all!
 Even when IΓÇÖm on a missionΓÇª
 My legs still tremble even nowΓÇª
 I think that IΓÇÖll never become stronger though I strive and striveΓÇª
 I am so afraid that I canΓÇÖt bear it!
 What am I to doΓÇª?
 ThereΓÇÖs no point in making the effort if you donΓÇÖt believe in yourself!
 Lee, youΓÇÖre very similar to me.
 Do you mean our eyebrows?
 No, not just our eyebrowsΓÇª
 I was actually a failure once tooΓÇª
 You were, Sensei?
 But now, I can even win against the genius elite Kakashi,
 because of my effortsΓÇª
 ΓÇ£IΓÇÖd like to prove that I can become a respectable Ninja
 even though I canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu and GenjutsuΓÇ¥ you said.
 ThatΓÇÖs your Ninja way, right?
 ThatΓÇÖs a fine goalΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a fine goal worth sticking to!
 ThatΓÇÖs why you should believe in your path and forge straight ahead!
 Become a man powerful enough so that I can just watch you smiling!
 Understand, Lee?!
 Yes!
 Thank youΓÇªGuy SenseiΓÇª!
 Stop, Lee!
 If you fight any more, youΓÇÖll die!
 Bushy BrowsΓÇª
 What?!
 Movement has...
 ...returned to Lee!
 Sensei is smiling and watching meΓÇª
 And just because of that, I can come back stronger!
 StrongerΓÇª stronger still!
 LeeΓÇÖs smilingΓÇªeven though heΓÇÖs been driven into corner.
 No.
 ItΓÇÖs his turn to do the driving.
 Huh?
 The LeafΓÇÖs Lotus blossoms twice.
 Blossoms twiceΓÇª?
 Lee said that too!
 The LeafΓÇÖs Lotus blossoms twice.
 When we meet the next time, I vow that I will be an even stronger man.
 No, Guy!
 You havenΓÇÖt?!
 ItΓÇÖs exactly as you imagine.
 So that GeninΓÇª
 that boy can open the Eight Inner Gates in his body and use the Hidden LotusΓÇª
 The Hidden Lotus?
 ThatΓÇÖs right ΓÇª
 This is incredibleΓÇª
 GuyΓÇª
 How many of the Eight Inner Gates can that boy open nowΓÇª?
 Five gates.
 What exactly is it?
 These Eight Inner Gates and that Hidden Lotus?
 The Eight Inner Gates are ΓÇ£Limiter ReleasesΓÇ¥
 used in preparations for reaching the Hidden Lotus.
 A ΓÇ£Limiter ReleasesΓÇ¥?
 ThatΓÇÖs right ΓÇª
 In the Chakra Network where chakra flows,
 there are eight places where the chakra points are concentrated
 in each area of the body from the head area down--
 the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest, Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,
 Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy, Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.
 These are called the Eight Inner Gates.
 These eight gates continually ΓÇ£limitΓÇ¥
 the amount of Chakra flowing through the bodyΓÇª
 However, the LotusΓÇÖs essence is to force the boundaries of these ΓÇ£limitsΓÇ¥ to openΓÇª
 and bring out several tens of times the bodyΓÇÖs strength.
 The Primary LotusΓÇª
 opens only the first gate, the Gate of Opening,
 and releases the brains restraints
 to bring forth a personΓÇÖs musclesΓÇÖ strength to its fullest!
 ThatΓÇÖs the kind of technique it is.
 SoΓÇªwhat is the Hidden Lotus?
 After forcing the stamina to increase at the second gate, the Gate of RestΓÇª
 From the third gate, the Gate of Life, one enters the Hidden Lotus!
 No way!
 Even after using just the Primary Lotus, his body was in shambles.
 So if he uses a technique beyond thatΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Huh?
 By opening all the 8 gates,
 one attains strength exceeding even the Hokage, but in returnΓÇª
 one dies!
 I donΓÇÖt intend to pry into what that boy means to you
 or to tell you not to bring your personal feelings into playΓÇª
 But there is a limit!
 IΓÇÖve misjudged youΓÇªGuy!
 What do you knowΓÇªabout that boy?!
 There is something important which
 that boy wants to prove and protect even if it costs him his life.
 IΓÇÖd like to prove that I can become a respectable Ninja
 even though I canΓÇÖt use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 ThatΓÇÖs why IΓÇª
 wanted to make him a man that could protect that thing.
 ThatΓÇÖs all there isΓÇª
 Lee!
 IΓÇÖm going to teach you a new technique.
 Yippie, yeah!
 ΓÇô One that will be your trump card. ΓÇô Yeah, that's great!
 Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!
 Lee, listen to my explanation seriously, all right?!
 Y-Yes, Sensei!
 Let me first say that...
 this is more of a forbidden Jutsu than the Primary Lotus!
 And it will become the most special technique for you.
 Special...?
 However...
 there is one strict condition for using this technique.
 That is...
 That isΓÇª
 What?
 I donΓÇÖt know what youΓÇÖre planning to doΓÇª
 But this is the end for you.
 ThatΓÇÖs trueΓÇª
 In any caseΓÇª it will be the end with the next.
 NejiΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇªandΓÇª
 There is no way that I alone can lose in a place like this!
 Guy SenseiΓÇªplease allow thisΓÇª!
 It is now!
 The time to carry through and protect oneΓÇÖs own Way of the Ninja!
 The Third Gate of LifeΓÇªopen!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 When you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Effort is always rewarded. My belief in this has brought me this far.
 Neji, Sasuke, and NarutoΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no way that I can lose in a place like this!
 Even though this technique is my ace in the hole,
 IΓÇÖll show it especially to you!
 This is my ultimate secret Taijutsu technique!

 HehΓÇª WellΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs a drag, but itΓÇÖs Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs orders.
 Old Lady TsunadeΓÇÖsΓÇª?
 YouΓÇÖre pursuing Mizuki, right?
 Y-YeahΓÇª!
 AndΓÇªwho are these guys here?
 Fujin and Raijin.
 FujinΓÇªand Raijin?
 Yeah. TheyΓÇÖre a little weak upstairs, but their brute strengthΓÇª
 is Herculean, surpassing even that of the Legendary Sannin.
 Are you serious?
 DamnΓÇª It looks like he really means it.
 Pretty amazing that they are able to hold out
 against the Shadow Possession Jutsu only by using their strengthΓÇª
 It looks like this is gonna turn into a troublesome situation againΓÇª
 Leave this to usΓÇª You go pursue Mizuki!
 WeΓÇÖll be fine!
 Leave it to us!
 Awright!
 But be careful!
 Those guys are crazy like monsters!
 YeahΓÇª I can see that.
 Go, Naruto!
 Thanks, guys!
 We better hurry, Naruto!
 Your opponents are this way!
 You guysΓÇª Doing this kind of thing to us brothers!
 DonΓÇÖt even think weΓÇÖre gonna let you leave here alive!
 WellΓÇª I wouldnΓÇÖt be so sure about that.
 Choji! Ino! LetΓÇÖs hurry and take care of these guys!

 Mizuki! Where are you?
 D-Damn!
 This is GenjutsuΓÇª

 After GenjutsuΓÇª Puppets come, huh?
 His Jutsu are diverse.
 And moreover, the timing of his Jutsu are superbΓÇª
 I was really close to   being taken downΓÇª
 I wouldnΓÇÖt have imagined that
 he could have such full command of the high level JutsuΓÇªthat Mizuki.
 I guess I can praise you on catching that the Puppet was real.
 HoweverΓÇª I wonder how long
 youΓÇÖre gonna be able to continue to engage in my game, Iruka!

 Iruka SenseiΓÇª IΓÇÖll catch up with you in no timeΓÇª
 Please be safe!
 How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?
 Pretty good for being self-taught, wouldnΓÇÖt you say?
 I canΓÇÖt understandΓÇª
 You have the ability to use such high-level Ninjutsu to this degreeΓÇª
 why would you waste it?!
 As always, trying to impose your morals on me, huhΓÇª?!
 YouΓÇÖre so lukewarm! YouΓÇÖre so na├»ve!
 DonΓÇÖt you start preaching me!
 I wonΓÇÖt acknowledge you, no matter what!
 I consistently hardened my heart and carried out my missionsΓÇª
 Despite that, those guys in the villageΓÇª
 No matter how strong I was!
 No matter how many enemies I took down in my missions!
 Those guys didnΓÇÖt even attempt to acknowledge me!
 Saying weΓÇÖre comrades, itΓÇÖs all about teamworkΓÇª
 They were all bound by stupid rules!

 Right!
 Hey! Are you all right?!
 I-I canΓÇÖt feel my legΓÇª

 I seeΓÇª
 All right! LetΓÇÖs withdraw!
 Hurry!
 YeahΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunate, butΓÇª
 Guys who are of no use on the battleground
 only become a ball and chainΓÇª
 Even though itΓÇÖs just a minor injury,
 you wonΓÇÖt be able to move from this placeΓÇª
 If youΓÇÖre wanna blame someone,
 I suggest you blame your own helpless self!
 I simply carried out my mission faithfully.
 And despite that, those guys in the villageΓÇª
 Not one of them even attempted to acknowledge meΓÇª
 Why?! Why didnΓÇÖt anybody acknowledge my strength?!
 Why?! IrukaΓÇª!
 When you and even that Nine-Tailed brat are acknowledged, why only meΓÇª?
 ItΓÇÖs still not too late.
 If you pay for your crimes and start afresh,
 the people in the village will certainlyΓÇª
 How cocky! DonΓÇÖt preach to me!
 YouΓÇÖre just the same as those other guys in the village!
 You disdain me, donΓÇÖt you?!
 MizukiΓÇª
 EverythingΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª Everything began that dayΓÇª
 What are you gonna do, getting nervous now?
 MizukiΓÇª
 It finally takes place tomorrow, doesnΓÇÖt it?
 The AcademyΓÇÖs teacher recruitment examΓÇª

 IΓÇÖm envious of you. Your scores are better than mine.

 Not quiteΓÇª Well, in any case, letΓÇÖs both do our best!

 Now then, regarding MizukiΓÇª we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
 Yes, it canΓÇÖt be helped.
 I agreeΓÇª The questions that were raised
 at the time of that mission to recover the Secret ManuscriptΓÇª
 Until those are completely cleared upΓÇª lt canΓÇÖt be helped, can it?
 According to the autopsy reportΓÇª
 the cause of death to that corpse was given as suffocation.
 In Mizuki and the othersΓÇÖ reports,
 it stated that the leg injury was not that seriousΓÇª
 I understandΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs brilliant but it canΓÇÖt be helped.
 I was just carrying out the mission that I was assigned to do!
 Can you understand how miserable the life I've led has been since then?!
 Huh? Iruka?!
 You have no idea, do you?
 I have undergone so many hardships,
 and you, who has had it so easyΓÇª
 Which one of us is the true ShinobiΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs clarify that once and for all, shall we?!
 Now then come! Iruka!
 MizukiΓÇª Where are you?!
 You donΓÇÖt have any intention of reforming yourself, do you?!
 DonΓÇÖt make me say the same thing over and over again!
 Then IΓÇÖll bring this to an end nowΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs very unfortunate, though!
 What a tearjerkerΓÇª
 It makes me happy too, IrukaΓÇª
 Elder Brother?! WhatΓÇÖs the matter, Elder Brother?!
 HeyΓÇª You came back, Elder Brother!
 Uh, Elder Brother?
 What did you guys do toΓÇª to Elder Brother?!

 ThereΓÇÖs no time to be spaced out, Iruka.
 IΓÇÖm gonna take my time and have fun with thisΓÇª
 Take my time, got it?
 All right! Me too!

 Hey, Iruka, werenΓÇÖt you saying that
 you were going to bring this to an end ?
 I see! By end,
 you must have been talking about yourself, huh?!
 Heh! Just a little bit!
 Hang in there, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 DamnΓÇª!

 He graduated at the head of his class at the Academy at the age of seven,
 and attained Chunin level at the age of ten, didnΓÇÖt he?
 He became adept at using Sharingan at the age of eight.
 Yes, I remember.

 DonΓÇÖt kill meΓÇª!
 D-DonΓÇÖt kill me!
 You are not even worth killingΓÇª
 Foolish little brotherΓÇª
 If you want to kill me, begrudge me! Hate me!
 And keep on surviving in that unsightly mannerΓÇª
 Just continue fleeing and fleeing and hang onto your life!
 Shall we go outsideΓÇª?
 These guys arenΓÇÖt just anybodyΓÇª
 Itachi, itΓÇÖll be a pain in the neck if this kid moves around andΓÇª
 Maybe I better chop off a leg just in caseΓÇª
 W-What did he say?!
 Now thenΓÇª
 Long time no seeΓÇª
 Sasuke.
 Itachi Uchiha!
 ItachiΓÇªUchiha?
 The same as SasukeΓÇª An UchihaΓÇª
 HuhΓÇªSharinganΓÇª
 And moreover, he resembles you a lotΓÇª
 Who the heck is he?
 HeΓÇÖs my younger brother.
 But I heard that the entire Uchiha clan had been murdered.
 By you.
 Itachi UchihaΓÇªI will kill you!
 I must kill one certain man without fail!
 That manΓÇª
 My elder brotherΓÇª
 I thought I couldnΓÇÖt dieΓÇª without killing him, butΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the guy that Sasuke was saying ΓÇª
 The man he wanted to killΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs just as you saidΓÇª
 I held a grudge against you and hated you.
 For the singular purpose of killing you, IΓÇª
 IΓÇª
 have lived my life!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 ChidoriΓÇª?
 I will kill you!
 Die!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 I canΓÇÖt believe that SasukeΓÇÖs Jutsu was so easily thwartedΓÇª
 This doesnΓÇÖt look good!
 IΓÇÖve got to do something!
 Chakra permeates the airΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!
 You jerk!
 YouΓÇÖre in the way!
 Sasuke!
 Darn it!
 Ninja Art: SummoΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre too slow!
 HuhΓÇª? I canΓÇÖt feel the ChakraΓÇª
 Darn! Darn! Why is it?!
 My sword Shark Skin has the ability toΓÇª
 cut through and eat Chakra!
 ItΓÇÖs a pain in the butt
 if the kid moves around and uses Jutsu like thatΓÇª
 Before these legsΓÇª
 Should I chop off these arms?
 Why doesnΓÇÖt it emerge?!
 ItΓÇÖs pointlessΓÇª
 What?
 You guys just donΓÇÖt know me much, do you?
 This man Jiraiya does not fall victim to any womanΓÇÖs allurement,
 but rather his forte is winning womenΓÇÖs affection!
 IΓÇÖm not made to blindly follow after a womanΓÇÖs feminine charm!
 When you get to my level,
 women yelp with delight at my sex appeal!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools\
 Watch out, Sasuke!
 Naruto, donΓÇÖt help him.
 ButΓÇªSasuke is!
 It is your duty to watch through this battle, Naruto.
 What?!
 This is his fightΓÇª
 This represents everything that he has been carrying up to now.

 I'd like to prove that I could become a splendid Ninja
 even though I can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 All right!
 IΓÇÖm going to do my best again today!
 Oh! Bushy Brow!
 OhΓÇª Good morning, Naruto.
 Hey, hey, did you already get checked out by Old Lady Tsunade?
 How was it, how was it?
 The Leaf Village is in great trouble right now,
 so we must do our best!
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 Bushy Brow, you should get better as soon as possible
 and succeed in your mis--!
 ΓÇô Naruto! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 ItΓÇÖs Konohamaru!
 Huh? WhatΓÇÖs wrong with Konohamaru?
 HeΓÇÖs in trouble.
 In trouble?!
 The Will of Fire Still Burns
 At this rate, we will have to open it by force.
 Try it! Who do you think I am?!
 I am the grandson of the Third Hokage!
 If you go against me, thenΓÇª
 It means youΓÇÖre going against the Hokage!
 We need Lady Tsunade to assume her position immediately.
 Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!
 You'll get something even more terrible if you come close to me.
 Honorable grandson! Even for youΓÇª
 There are things that can and cannot be forgiven!
 Shut up!
 What is all this commotion so early in the morning?
 ItΓÇÖs hurting my head.
 Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 It's just one kidΓÇª What're you doing?
 YesΓÇª
 Get rid of him!
 But itΓÇÖs the grandson of the Third Hokage!
 It doesnΓÇÖt matter if heΓÇÖs the grandson or the great grandson.
 I am the granddaughter of the First Hokage!
 He might just open his eyes if he gets roughed up a little.
 Now move it!
 ΓÇô Yes! 					ΓÇô Yes!
 Wait!
 Naruto?!
 Hey, hold on there.
 I donΓÇÖt really know what's going on,
 but donΓÇÖt be so rough with Konohamaru, Old Lady Tsunade.
 An acquaintance of yours?
 Yes, yesΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll do the convincing, leave it to me.
 Then, do something by the end of the day!
 Oh, Lady TsunadeΓÇª Please wait!
 Excuse me.
 Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has already been discharged from the hospital.
 IΓÇÖm actually here to see Lee today. ls he in the rehabilitation room?
 Not yet. ThatΓÇÖs not like him to be late.
 I see.
 The probability of a successful surgery is 50%, at best.
 And if it fails, you'll die!
 Hey, Konohamaru. What are you doing in there?!
 Hurry up and come out. Then letΓÇÖs go eat some ramen.
 DonΓÇÖt worry. ItΓÇÖs on me!
 You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!
 All right! You can have eggs too! How about that!
 At least answer me!
 Shut up, you fool!
 You called me a fool!
 Open up already! IΓÇÖll break in! Hey!
 Try if you can!
 W-Why you--!
 ΓÇô NarutoΓÇª 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 Oh, LeeΓÇª YouΓÇÖre here.
 S-Sakura!
 I wanted to bring you this.
 F-ForΓÇª me?
 Th-Thank you very much!
 I-IΓÇÖm sorry, Sakura.
 No worries.
 Sasuke is now recuperating at home.
 Thanks to Lady Tsunade.
 At this rate,
 seems like heΓÇÖll be able to get back to his duties very soon.
 I see. ThatΓÇÖs very good.
 Lady Tsunade is great, after all.
 I think if you had her take a look, youΓÇÖd get better very quickly.
 YesΓÇª
 But if there is something that I can do,
 please feel free to tell me.
 Thank you very much, Sakura.
 Then IΓÇÖll see you soon.
 I would think that at least one bar would be open.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way. What time do you think it is right now?
 I canΓÇÖt drink sake, and I canΓÇÖt gamble.
 This place, the Hidden Leaf Village, is no fun at all.
 Just like the Third Hokage.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Oh, IΓÇÖm tired.
 I just want to sit down and have a drink somewhere.
 I understand.
 I will take you to a place where you can sit and have a drink.
 What?
 But I will have you do your work!
 Here now, go ahead. ItΓÇÖs hot.
 ShizuneΓÇªyouΓÇÖve suddenly become very strict!
 I havenΓÇÖt gotten strict. ltΓÇÖs probably that you were not aware.
 Not aware?!
 ΓÇ£If I canΓÇÖt get in the room, then I donΓÇÖt have to work.ΓÇ¥
 IsnΓÇÖt that what you were thinking?
 And thatΓÇÖs why you left it up to Naruto.
 Humph! Could beΓÇª
 This is the most recent list of Ninja.
 The names and lineups of the groups have changed a lot.
 So please look through them. And I mean, look through all of it!
 Oh bother.
 They have sweet rice cakes, too.
 I donΓÇÖt like sweet things!
 Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!
 At least tell me why youΓÇÖre doing this!
 Konohamaru!
 Darn!
 Everybody came here because theyΓÇÖre worried about you!
 If you donΓÇÖt come out, IΓÇÖm going to drag you out of there!
 Naruto Sacred Technique...
 Sexy Jutsu!
 Konohamaru, come out!
 Konohamaru, hurry!
 Hey! Say something at least! This is so embarrassing!
 DonΓÇÖt fool around with me!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 ΓÇô Stop it already, Konohamaru! ΓÇô Stop it already, Konohamaru!
 One, twoΓÇª
 ΓÇô Uh, what is this? ΓÇô What the--?!
 What's going on?!
 Are you okay? Naruto?
 This is the Old ManΓÇÖs room.
 Eight D-rank missions, three C-rank missionsΓÇª
 I see, very much like the Kurenai team.
 We can easily figure out what the Third Hokage was thinking.
 This is the same as their parentsΓÇÖ team.
 I see.
 Oh, I see. This team has their own specialty and is well-balanced.
 My shoulders are stiff.
 IΓÇÖm going to go get some fresh air outside.
 SuccessΓÇª
 SuccessΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª
 UhΓÇª Darn!
 If thatΓÇÖs how youΓÇÖre going to be, then IΓÇÖm not going to go easy on you.
 This is the Old ManΓÇÖs room!
 I wonΓÇÖt let anybody use this room besides him!
 The Old ManΓÇÖsΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs why, as his grandson, IΓÇÖm going to protect it!
 Fool! This isnΓÇÖt the time for that!
 The Leaf Village is in great danger!
 So what?! It doesnΓÇÖt matter to me.
 Are you seriously saying that?!
 Oh, now IΓÇÖm mad!
 And I can easily tear down one or two doors with my new powers--!
 ΓÇô Naruto! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 Old Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 Oh! Watch out!
 W-WowΓÇª
 Listen Konohamaru.
 The Hidden Leaf Village is in great trouble right now!
 Our forces have dropped to almost half, and we have to finish our missions!
 ThatΓÇÖs what I taught you!
 YeahΓÇª umΓÇª wellΓÇª
 But if we donΓÇÖt accomplish our missions,
 thatΓÇÖs letting other countries know that the village has been weakened.
 ThatΓÇÖs what Iruka Sensei taught you!
 Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?
 ItΓÇÖs not that! ltΓÇÖs not that at all.
 Then what is it?
 Soon, nobody will call me honorable grandson.
 Then IΓÇÖll just become plain old Konohamaru.
 So whatΓÇÖs wrong with plain old Konohamaru?
 NoΓÇª
 Why, why?! You hated being called honorable grandson!
 EverybodyΓÇÖs going to forget about the Old Man.
 The Old Man.
 TheyΓÇÖre going to forget what a great Ninja he was,
 theyΓÇÖre just going to put him away like an old ashtray.
 The new Hokage will make all kinds of changes in the Leaf Village.
 ThatΓÇÖs not true!
 The Hidden Leaf Village is the Hidden Leaf Village.
 And besides, nobody will forget about the Old Man!
 No! They will never forget about him!
 They will forget, I guarantee it.
 They wonΓÇÖt forget!
 ThatΓÇÖs a lie!
 ItΓÇÖs not a lie! You canΓÇÖt believe what I am saying?!
 ThatΓÇÖs right, I can't!
 Oh boy!
 Come with me, Konohamaru!
 We just have to get Old Lady Tsunade to promise
 that she wonΓÇÖt change the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 And then on top of that,
 we can get everybody to promise us that they wonΓÇÖt forget about the Old Man!
 What?
 IsnΓÇÖt that what you want?
 I canΓÇÖt believe that I let Lady Tsunade out of my sight!
 Did you find her, Tonton?
 Revitalizing the cells, I see.
 IΓÇÖve found you Lady Tsunade.
 What?
 Lady Tsunade is studying?!
 Be quiet! I canΓÇÖt concentrate.
 Concentrate?!
 IΓÇÖve never heard you use that word except when you're gambling.
 Is that ShizuneΓÇÖs voice?
 ShizuneΓÇª
 Do you remember that Medical Ninja by the name of Kabuto?
 What about him?
 His ability to create new cells.
 I was researching ways to use that power on the patients.
 For Lee?
 If the 50% chance becomes 51%, itΓÇÖs worth a try.
 It really depends on the individualΓÇÖs traits.
 Even for you, it might be hard to acquire those powers.
 IΓÇÖll just have to try.
 I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped, Konohamaru.
 I am the Third Hokage, after all.
 If you donΓÇÖt like it, you should just quit!
 Everybody from the village is my family.
 To protect the family, that is the duty of a Hokage.
 Oh! Old Man!
 Just for today, IΓÇÖm making a special exception.
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter Konohamaru?
 DonΓÇÖt you want to see Old Lady Tsunade?
 No.
 IΓÇÖll just have to do it. I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped, Konohamaru. I am the Third Hokage, after all.
 It canΓÇÖt be helped. I am the honorable grandson, after all.
 Huh?
 I am Konohamaru of the Hidden Leaf Village, after all!
 H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on with him? Hey Konohamaru!
 Lady Tsunade?
 NothingΓÇª
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Back then, Sensei taught me
 that I would grow up to become a great Ninja
 through lots of effort and competition with my rivals.
 His words put me at ease.
 A path opened up for me just when I was unsure of myself.
 I realized that all I had to do was try my best.
 But nowΓÇª

1,"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.
 With its powerful tails,
 it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.
 A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.
 We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!
 We can't let it get any closer to our village!
 One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,
 but died in the process.
 This Ninja was known asΓÇª the Fourth Hokage.
 Naruto!
 Why did you do such a thing?!
 You're really gonna get it this time!
 I don't care!
 You know your problem?
 You can't do the things I do!
 Only I can do this!
 I'm better than all of you! Believe it!
 There's a problem, sir!
 Lord Hokage!
 What is it?
 Did that Naruto do something again?
 Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside ImagesΓÇª
 And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!
 Wait!
 Ha haΓÇª
 Why should I?
 Hey, Naruto!
 How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?
 The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?
 Now listen, Naruto.
 You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.
 This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!
 We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!
 Even those who already passed will take it!
 Whaaaat?!
 Sakura Haruno. Here I goΓÇª
 Transform!
 OK!
 I did it!
 Cha!
 Did you see that, Sasuke?
 Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yes.
 O-OK.
 Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
 This is a real pain.
 And it's all your fault.
 Like I care!!
 OKΓÇª
 Good luck, NarutoΓÇª
 Transform!
 How was it?
 I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""!
 You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!
 DarnΓÇª
 DarnΓÇª
 I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.
 I don't careΓÇª
 There's nobody home anyway.
 Naruto...
 What is it this time?
 What I meant wasΓÇª
 If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.
 Huh?!
 Yes! I-I will finish it no time!
 Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto.
 Why did you vandalize those faces?
 Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?
 Of course, I do!
 I know they earned the title Lord Hokage
 because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?
 Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero
 who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.
 Then why did you do that?
 Because I'll become a Hokage myself.
 And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!
 So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!
 By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.
 You want another bowl?
 MmmmΓÇªNoΓÇª
 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?
 This?
 No no!
 This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Tomorrow, you willΓÇª
 You're so mean!
 So that's why you took off your gogglesΓÇª
 Humph... One more bowl please!
 We are now about to begin the graduation test.
 When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.
 The test is on the Clone Jutsu.
 Oh noΓÇª
 Of all theΓÇª! That is my weakest Jutsu!
 But stillΓÇª I will do it no matter what!
 Clone Jutsu!
 Disqualified!
 Iruka Sensei.
 His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.
 And he managed to come up with something.
 Isn't that enough for him to pass?
 Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.
 Naruto created just one.
 And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.
 I 'm a Ninja now!
 You did well. That's my son.
 Congratulations for your graduation.
 I'll cook something good tonight!
 Look at that one.
 It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.
 Isn't that the boy who is actuallyΓÇª
 Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.
 Iruka. We need to talk later.
 Yes, sir.
 Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.
 Then why only me?
 He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.
 You both don't have parents.
 But I really wanted to graduate.
 Heh... I guess I have no choiceΓÇª
 I'll let you in on a big secret.
 Secret?
 Iruka.
 What is it, Lord Hokage?
 I know how you feel. ButΓÇª
 Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parentsΓÇªlike you.
 Let me go!
 My mom and dad are still out there fighting!
 Wake up, Iruka Sensei!
 What's the matter?
 Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!
 I heard that NarutoΓÇª stole the Scroll of Sealing.
 The Scroll of Sealing?!
 Let's seeΓÇª
 The first Jutsu isΓÇª Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?
 What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?
 Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!
 This is not just a prank!
 The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!
 Depending on its useΓÇª
 It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!
 Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!
 Yes, sir!
 Where did you goΓÇªNaruto?
 I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate NarutoΓÇª
 Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!
 Hey you, Naruto!
 You found me..
 And I've only learned one Jutsu.
 He's been practicing the JutsuΓÇª
 until he's become this exhausted and dirtyΓÇª?
 Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!
 You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!
 Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?
 Who told you that?
 Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this placeΓÇª
 Mizuki did?!
 I'm impressed you found this place.
 I see nowΓÇªhow it is.
 Naruto, give me that scroll.
 Wait, waitΓÇª What's going on here?
 Naruto! Never give him that scroll!
 It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.
 Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!
 W-Wha--?
 Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!
 Huh?
 What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!
 I will tell you the truth.
 Idiot! Don't do that!
 After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.
 A rule?
 That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.
 Except me?! 					What is it?
 Stop it, Mizuki!
 The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!
 Huh?
 You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!
 Stop it!
 Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.
 Didn't you find it strange?
 Why everyone hated you so much?
 No! No! No! No! No!
 NarutoΓÇª
 Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!
 Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.
 Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.
 That's why he keeps misbehaving.
 It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.
 He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.
 Die, Naruto!
 Naruto! 					Get down!
 WhyΓÇª?
 Because you and I are the same.
 After my parents died,
 nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.
 I wasn't a good student in school.
 I was the class clownΓÇª because I wanted people to notice me.
 I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.
 It was so hard.
 Isn't that right, Naruto?
 You felt so lonelyΓÇªright? And you suffered inside, right?
 I'm sorry, NarutoΓÇª.
 If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.
 Don't make me laugh!
 Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!
 He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!
 Naruto!
 Narutoooooo!
 He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.
 He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!
 Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.
 NoΓÇª NarutoΓÇªisn'tΓÇªlike that at all!
 All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.
 I'll take care of you later!
 I-I won't let youΓÇª
 Well, well.
 Mizuki has a big mouth!
 Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.
 He might unleash the power locked up inside him.
 The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.
 There's a slight chance he might actually release
 the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!
 If that happensΓÇª
 I've found him!
 Naruto!
 Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!
 Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!
 It can't beΓÇª
 Why is it, Naruto?
 HowΓÇª
 did you know I wasn't IrukaΓÇª?
 Because I'm Iruka.
 I see.
 What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?
 I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!
 You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.
 Same?
 Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.
 There is no way that that monsterΓÇª
 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!
 You're rightΓÇª
 I guess it was true all along!
 See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!
 ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.
 But Naruto is different!
 I know that he is an exceptional student.
 He works very hard,
 and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.
 No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.
 He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.
 He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 You are so gullible. 					lruka!
 I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.
 Die!
 I guess this is the end for meΓÇª
 Naruto?!
 You surprised me there, freak.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!
 Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!
 Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!
 Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! You'veΓÇª
 Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 What's thisΓÇª?
 What's the matter? 					C'mon!
 Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!
 In that caseΓÇª I'll come to you.
 I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?
 Yeah.
 He's really something.
 Maybe it is true.
 Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leadersΓÇª
 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.
 Has anyone found Naruto yet?
 No.
 Darn, this is going to be badΓÇª
 There's no need to worry anymore.
 Lord Hokage!
 He'll be back soon.
 Sensei, how much longer?
 OK, you may open your eyes now.
 CongratulationsΓÇªon your graduation.
 In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!
 Iruka Sensei!
 That hurts!
 NarutoΓÇª
 I was going to lecture to you...
 that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.
 But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen standΓÇª
 W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!
 You're smaller than me and
 you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?
 I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.
 It's not that easy to be a Hokage!
 If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!

140,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans arenΓÇÖt such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so donΓÇÖt hide your fists
 YouΓÇÖre not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, youΓÇÖre the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 DonΓÇÖt forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 WeΓÇÖre way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Two Heartbeats:                       Kabuto's Trap
 Huh?!
 It canΓÇÖt be!
 Even if you put up a bluff I can foresee ΓÇª
 that you are alreadyΓÇªfinished.
 Poor thing.
 This child is trembling like a puppy
 Now, KabutoΓÇª
 Get rid of her, but donΓÇÖt make her suffer.
 I understand.
 SasukeΓÇª
 I-IΓÇÖll do anything for you!
 So IΓÇÖm begging youΓÇª Please stay here!
 You are really annoying.
 Please donΓÇÖt go!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Thank youΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Wait!
 Hmm?
 Did youΓÇªsay something?
 Wait!
 WhereΓÇÖs Sasuke! Where is Sasuke?
 It couldnΓÇÖt be thatΓÇª your body is already Sasuke'sΓÇª?
 ThereΓÇÖs no need to keep it a secret any longer.
 ItΓÇÖs all right, Kabuto, go on and tell her.
 He was a little late in getting here.
 Lord Orochimaru wasnΓÇÖt able to wait for Sasuke,
 and already had been reincarnated into another vessel.
 So Sasuke is all right?! Somewhere in this buildingΓÇª
 Lord Orochimaru gave Sasuke the Curse Mark,
 so he could wait for the next opportunity to reincarnate.
 ButΓÇª
 Not all humans can tolerate Curse Marks.
 No way, thereΓÇÖs no way that Sasuke could beΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs right, Sasuke wasnΓÇÖt able to tolerate the Curse Mark
 and so he died.
 That's a lie.
 It has to be a lie!
 What would telling a lie like that accomplish?
 To someone thatΓÇÖs going to dieΓÇª As you are?
 If you want to see him that badly IΓÇÖll let you see him.
 When you die, you can see him in the other world.
 SasukeΓÇª
 Sakura!
 Sakura, don't you believeΓÇª
 what a guy like him says!
 Naruto!
 So itΓÇÖs Naruto, I thought youΓÇÖd drowned and died a long time ago butΓÇª
 When I make a promise I donΓÇÖt give up.
 That's my Way of Ninja!
 I ain't gonna die, until I get Sasuke back!
 This is interesting!
 Sakura, go hide!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 IΓÇÖm over here!
 Hey stupid, over here! Over here, over here!
 WhereΓÇÖre you looking? IΓÇÖm over here! Over here!
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing? Hey!
 So youΓÇÖve used up all your Kunai KnivesΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm gonnaΓÇªcompletely blow you away!
 How annoying!
 Fire Style:
 Misty Flames Dance Jutsu!
 ΓÇô Ouch! 					ΓÇô ThatΓÇÖs hot!
 ΓÇô Yikes! 					ΓÇô Oww!
 YouΓÇÖre too slow!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto!
 Since you and Orochimaru are here,
 it means Sasuke is probably here too!
 Tell us the truth right now!
 Wh-What the heck? My body wonΓÇÖt moveΓÇª
 Have a good look at yourself.
 Wh-WhatΓÇÖs this?
 Those are Chakra Threads.
 Chakra Threads?
 While you were attacking earlier,
 I wrapped the thread around you.
 Take a good look at where that thread is connected.
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Those Chakra Threads areΓÇª
 connected to my heartΓÇÖs Chakra Network.
 And Naruto, the thread thatΓÇÖs wrapped around you
 is connected through my Chakra Network to your organs and to your heart.
 See, can you hear that?
 My heart and your heart will eventually become connected as one!
 ΓÇô Damn! 					ΓÇô Naruto!
 ItΓÇÖs no use. That thread is formulated and spun with Chakra
 and it will absolutely not break.
 Now our hearts are completely synchronizedΓÇª
 The Chakra which passes through this thread
 via the Chakra Network from my heart is controlling your heart ,you see.
 ItΓÇÖs no use, even though itΓÇÖs my heartΓÇª
 If my heart beat gets faster, your heart will get faster tooΓÇª
 And when my heart stops beatingΓÇª
 you will die too!
 DonΓÇÖt! If you stop your heart, youΓÇÖll die too!
 ThatΓÇÖs right. But that doesnΓÇÖt mean much.
 Since IΓÇÖve already promised my body to Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 Wh-What the heck are you gonna do?!
 If I crush this heartΓÇª
 you will die too!
 If I crush this heartΓÇª
 you will die too!
 Now, together we willΓÇª
 Naruto!
 HowΓÇÖs it feel to have your heart seized?
 ItΓÇÖll be all rightΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖll be out of your misery right away!
 Stop it!
 How foolish, if you kill me Naruto will die too.
 What IΓÇÖm gonna cutΓÇª
 is this!
 ThereΓÇÖs no use you know,
 ItΓÇÖs impossible to cut thread formulated and made from Chakra.
 Even Lady TsunadeΓÇÖs great strength wouldnΓÇÖt be able to break it.
 What should IΓÇª What should I do?!
 Naruto is suffering right in front of my eyes and yetΓÇª
 I canΓÇÖt do anything!
 SakuraΓÇª!
 IΓÇªabsolutely will not lose!
 Until IΓÇÖve fulfilled my promise!
 You bravado ends there.
 Now, shall we die together?
 And go to the place where Sasuke is waiting?
 Naruto!
 Sakura!
 ΓÇô Sasame?! 					ΓÇô SakuraΓÇª
 Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Naruto?! Hey, are you okay? Naruto!
 No wayΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 No way!
 Naruto!
 AhhΓÇª My chest right now is beating with joy.
 Idiot! It was a waste for me to have worried!
 Sorry, SakuraΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre so worthless!
 ThatΓÇÖs right, Sasame! Why are you here?
 Well, itΓÇÖsΓÇª
 I was saved by Sasame, you know.
 Me too.
 What do you mean?
 Water came rushing into that trap pit we were in earlierΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs it! The lid to the pit!
 Damn!
 When the water reached the ceiling,
 I desperately tried to open the lid, but wasnΓÇÖt able to escapeΓÇª
 I was told by Master Jiraiya to go to where Hanzaki is.
 But I got concerned about Arashi, so I cameΓÇª
 Naruto!
 Hey! Thanks!
 Th-The frog spokeΓÇª!
 Well, come to think of it,
 thereΓÇÖs no way you could open the lid of the trap by pushing on it.
 Geez!
 But how come the thread that I couldnΓÇÖt cut with the Kunai Knife,
 be cut when I wrapped it with SasameΓÇÖs tag?
 Because the Chakra Thread is a Secret Technique
 within the secrets of our Fuuma Ninja TechniqueΓÇª
 Of the Fuuma?!
 Oh I seeΓÇª So who the heck is this?!
 Oh!
 She isΓÇªfrom earlier!
 Mistress KageroΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs a Fuuma Jonin.
 Sasame!
 SasameΓÇª
 I was resurrected by Lord OrochimaruΓÇª
 You! YouΓÇÖre being tricked by Orochimaru!
 Where is Sasuke?
 And Arashi? WhereΓÇÖs SasameΓÇÖs cousin!
 Lord Orochimaru isΓÇª
 going to raise our Fuuma clanΓÇª
 to the center stage of Shinobi again.
 YouΓÇÖre still talking about that stuff?!
 At least tell Sasame the truth!
 So itΓÇÖs there! HeΓÇÖs in there!
 Sasame and ArashiΓÇª You two were so closeΓÇª
 Then itΓÇÖd be better if you didnΓÇÖt see him.
 Mistress Kagero ΓÇª
 What do you want to do, Sasame?
 Do you want to wait here?
 I will see him! No matter whatΓÇÖs in store for me!
 I came all the way here to see Arashi!
 Yeah! YouΓÇÖve got guts!
 All right! LetΓÇÖs go together!
 Yeah! LetΓÇÖs go!
 SasameΓÇª
 There might be some sort of trapΓÇª
 Leave it to me!
 Orochimaru?!
 Good of you to come, SasameΓÇª
 WhyΓÇª?
 ArashiΓÇª!
 Arashi!
 Arashi?
 IΓÇÖm no longerΓÇª
 ArashiΓÇª
 Wh-What the heck is going on?!
 The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Jonin were combined into oneΓÇª
 and IΓÇÖve been reborn as the ultimate Ninja you seeΓÇª
 Now, IΓÇÖll show you my ultimate NinjutsuΓÇªSasame!
 NoΓÇª ArashiΓÇª
 Damn, Orochimaru!
 I will not forgive him, no matter what!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 IΓÇÖll keep these thoughtsΓÇª
 SorryΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorry, Naruto.
 I havenΓÇÖt been able to do anything, after all.
 IΓÇÖm always dragging you down. I hadnΓÇÖt changed at all.
 But Naruto, Sasame, you two taught me.
 ThatΓÇÖs why I want to change the kind of person I am!
 This time, this time, itΓÇÖs my turn to give it my all!
 Next time, ΓÇ£Sakura's Determination!ΓÇ¥

165,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 IΓÇÖll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 IΓÇÖve made my decision,
 even if thereΓÇÖs a long way to go on that road.
 IΓÇÖll continue towards the future IΓÇÖve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond thatΓÇª What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª
 The mission in the Land of Birds is overΓÇª
 That is enough.
 But, then what about NarutoΓÇª?
 As the leader, I am responsible for all of this.
 Sacrifice is an unavoidable part of Shinobi missionsΓÇª
 NowΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go back to our village!
 Do you think theyΓÇÖre really going back to their village, Nagare?
 PerhapsΓÇª
 But IΓÇÖm concerned about that masked guy who joined up with them laterΓÇª
 Shall I follow him, Hokushin?
 No, IΓÇÖll do that. You give the report.
 All rightΓÇª
 The Death of Naruto
 How did things turn outΓÇª?
 The two as well as the one who joined up with them laterΓÇª
 seem to have crossed the border
 and are heading for the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 I see.
 And it seems Lord Sagi took care
 of the one who infiltrated the residence of the feudal lord.
 Very nice indeed.
 WhatΓÇÖre they doing there for the past hourΓÇª?
 P-Persimmon! 					Wh-What the--?
 ΓÇô OuchΓÇª 					ΓÇô That hurtsΓÇª
 It couldnΓÇÖt be!
 Substitution Jutsu! Since whenΓÇª?
 They tricked me! Those Leaf ShinobiΓÇª
 Lord KomeiΓÇª Come out.
 Land of Birds Tactician Komei.
 You have abused the key position in this land of tactician
 and committed the crime of assassinating
 the previous feudal lord Lord Owashi and his child Lady Toki.
 And you also ordered a subordinate
 to run wild as the ghost called the Cursed Warrior,
 disturbed the public, you undermined the government of the land,
 endangered Lord SagiΓÇÖs position of feudal lord
 and attempted to attain the position himself,
 an unforgivable crime of treason!
 Therefore, you are ordered to perform seppuku!
 I seeΓÇª That explains it.
 You ensnared me, didnΓÇÖt you, Moso?!
 YouΓÇÖre disgraceful, Komei! lf youΓÇÖre a warrior, kill yourself like one!
 Assist him with the seppuku at once!
 ΓÇô Yes, my lord! ΓÇô Yes, my lord!
 Is this it nowΓÇª?
 Wh-What?!
 Hidden Mist Jutsu? No! This isΓÇª
 It does not matter! Kill him!
 Yes, my lord!
 Begging your pardon, I shall assist!
 Who are you?!
 Wh-What is this? WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 ΓÇô The Cursed Warrior! ΓÇô ItΓÇÖs the Cursed WarriorΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs the Cursed Warrior?!
 Yes!
 After him! DonΓÇÖt let him get away!
 ΓÇô Right! 					ΓÇô Right!
 You guys go after him as isΓÇª!
 IΓÇÖve got something I want to look into,
 so IΓÇÖll be going on ahead!
 ΓÇô Roger! 					ΓÇô Roger!
 I knew it!
 You two were conspirators, right?!
 Hold it!
 YouΓÇÖre the guys from the other nightΓÇª
 IΓÇÖve witnessed the true identity of the ghost.
 WhoΓÇÖs there?
 Hey-hey, Komei.
 YouΓÇÖre the one responsible for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 I was also attempting to investigate
 the true identity of the Cursed Warrior that dayΓÇª
 I was almost sure it couldnΓÇÖt be anyone but that personΓÇª
 What a pain! IΓÇÖll expose the true identity here.
 DonΓÇÖt botherΓÇª
 Kakashi Sensei. Where were you until now?
 IΓÇÖll explain later. Go on ahead!
 Hurry! YouΓÇÖre going with them.
 ButΓÇª
 LetΓÇÖs go, Tenten!
 Wait, Neji!
 Come on outΓÇª
 You were following me the whole time, right?
 If thatΓÇÖs your intentionΓÇª
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What is it, Kakashi?
 Smoke out the Ninja hiding on the temple groundsΓÇª
 Consider it done.
 Hey! You thereΓÇª
 Hide-and-seek is over. Come on out now!
 I canΓÇÖt fool a dogΓÇÖs nose, as would be expectedΓÇª
 You finally grace me with your presence, huh?
 Why is there a holeΓÇª in a place like this?
 I have heard the feudal lord built secret passages such as this
 all over the land in order to look in on the lives of the general publicΓÇª
 The feudal lord?!
 Then that Cursed Warrior has something to do
 with the feudal lordΓÇª?
 At the very least, it seems heΓÇÖs not a ghost.
 When the time comes,
 IΓÇÖm sure he will reveal his true identity from his end.
 IsnΓÇÖt it common sense for hired Ninja
 to return quietly to their village after completing a mission?
 ItΓÇÖs different in the case
 of the premise of the commissioned mission breaking down.
 There were too many suspicious points in this mission.
 YouΓÇÖre sticking your nose too far into the business of another land.
 Here you couldΓÇÖve returned safely to your land
 if you hadnΓÇÖt secretively sniffed around like a dog.
 Excuse me for being a dog!
 Universal Assimilation Jutsu!
 Prepare yourself!
 What?!
 What is this guy?!
 Has he introduced properties of stone into his body?
 Since youΓÇÖve learned of part of this landΓÇÖs secrets,
 I canΓÇÖt let you live!
 He seems to be a somewhat troublesome opponent.
 Yeah. ThatΓÇÖs good enough, Pakkun.
 IΓÇÖll be okay by myself from here on.
 I seeΓÇª See you later!
 Assimilation: Rock Tank.
 IΓÇÖll crush you!
 A Shadow CloneΓÇª?!
 This is as far as it goesΓÇª
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª
 A Paper Bomb?!
 NowΓÇª That should be enough, right?
 Huh?
 YeahΓÇª We should be okay having come this far.
 Th-That voiceΓÇª?!
 N-NarutoΓÇª!
 I knew it.
 The true identity of the Cursed Warrior wasnΓÇÖt Lord Sagi?
 YourΓÇª
 Your true identity isΓÇª
 Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi?
 From the way he was standing still,
 I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi.
 ThereΓÇÖs a profound reason for thisΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖre you doing, Tenten?!
 Then tell me sooner!
 It seems you also knew it was Naruto, Neji.
 YeahΓÇª Ages ago.
 Jeez, you two!
 I was really worried!
 There was a surveillance Shinobi following us the whole time, right?
 Neji, TentenΓÇª DonΓÇÖt look back.
 WeΓÇÖre being followed!
 WeΓÇÖre going back to the Land of Birds.
 Just do as I sayΓÇª Got it?!
 Y-Yes!
 UnderstoodΓÇª
 But didnΓÇÖt we shake the pursuer with Substitution?
 YesΓÇª OnceΓÇª
 HoweverΓÇª
 when we chased the Cursed Warrior from the execution groundsΓÇª
 a different Shinobi followed us.
 JeezΓÇª Am I the only one who didnΓÇÖt know?
 It was a waste to worry!
 Then you, in the place of Lord SagiΓÇª?
 YeahΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª So Lord Sagi is safe!
 You okay, mister?!
 IΓÇÖm sorryΓÇª
 That Moso acted rashly,
 forcing me to make a false confession.
 Man, youΓÇÖve been beaten up goodΓÇª
 Well, weΓÇÖll tell you about the developments inside.
 Sagi is waiting!
 Assimilation: Rock Shower!
 WeΓÇÖre Wandering ShinobiΓÇª
 We make do without having a village by going around to every village,
 stealing Jutsu and devising new Ninjutsu.
 For example, a Jutsu like this one, tooΓÇª
 S-Say what?
 Sharingan!
 Assimilation: Sand Coffin!
 HeΓÇÖs using the same Jutsu as Gaara!
 Assimilation: Sand Funeral!
 Sagi!
 HowΓÇÖs Chishima doingΓÇª?
 HeΓÇÖs okayΓÇª ThereΓÇÖs no threat to his life.
 HeΓÇÖs resting and receiving treatment
 in the treatment room of my residence.
 ThatΓÇÖs goodΓÇª
 Did something happen to Chishima?
 WhoΓÇª? Who hurt him?!
 KomeiΓÇª IΓÇÖm sorry for the misunderstanding!
 My lord, I don't deserve those magnanimous words!
 Although he had suffered injuries, Chishima came to tell me.
 At that timeΓÇª
 I must not let you live as is
 now that you have learned of everything!
 As the thief who snuck into the residence of the feudal lord,
 your fate is the death sentence!
 No wayΓÇª!
 L-Lord SagiΓÇª
 Chishima?!
 Bro!
 Shuriken woundsΓÇª?
 Go to the residence doctor!
 Lord SagiΓÇª
 Please listenΓÇª
 Lord Moso, no, Moso has betrayed youΓÇª
 What?
 Moso was the one
 who killed your father, Lord Owashi, and Lady Toki!
 And Moso had his own Ninja henchmen use the guardsmen shuriken
 to falsely accuse Lord KomeiΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sure Lord Komei learned of MosoΓÇÖs scheme andΓÇª
 Hang in there, Chishima!
 Lord Sagi, pleaseΓÇª Stop Lord KomeiΓÇÖs execution.
 We have to go save him quickly!
 I must not stop the execution!
 Wh-Why is that?!
 I wonΓÇÖt be able to have my revenge
 if Moso realizes that I have learned the truthΓÇª
 Are you saying it doesnΓÇÖt matter who is sacrificed
 if itΓÇÖs for the sake of your revenge?!
 Then what would you do?
 Komei is being kept under strict watch by powerful soldiers.
 We would have no chance of winning
 if theywe were to cause a rebellion thereΓÇª
 Then IΓÇÖll go! I will save Komei on my own!
 You donΓÇÖt have a problem with that, do you?
 Lord SagiΓÇª
 Do as you likeΓÇª
 And so I disguised myself as the Cursed Warrior.
 I played the part of Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to look for the assassination culpritΓÇª
 But against my intentionsΓÇª
 Instead of finding the true culpritΓÇª
 KomeiΓÇª I was used as a tool to incriminate you.
 I thought the Cursed Warrior I encountered in my bedroom
 was you, Lord SagiΓÇª
 And so I headed for the abandoned temple
 where the Cursed Warrior once vanished.
 There I encountered the Cursed Warrior, butΓÇª
 That Cursed Warrior wasnΓÇÖt me.
 Perhaps it was a fake that Moso devised.
 ThatΓÇÖs it, believe it! All of it was that old man MosoΓÇÖs trap!
 That Moso!
 Did he think to first dispose of me
 and then eventually attempt to rule the Land of Birds
 by doing away with Lord Sagi?
 That guy acting like a good guy!
 IΓÇÖll grab him up and kick his butt!
 Naruto, was it? You did good work.
 HoweverΓÇª
 I will take care of things from here on!
 WellΓÇª ButΓÇª
 I will even the score by myself.
 As long as the score isnΓÇÖt settledΓÇª
 the clock inside my heartΓÇª will remain stopped in the past!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although youΓÇÖre strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just donΓÇÖt understand, baby
 When youΓÇÖre sad, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 Even on nights when weΓÇÖre apart, IΓÇÖll be close to you
 IΓÇÖll be close to you
 What do you mean you will even the score on your own?!
 What good can you do going by yourself?!
 Even you did avenge them, the dead wonΓÇÖt come back!
 Do you still insist on having  revenge?!
 Would that make you feel better?!
 Would that really make your father and sister happy?!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way

 Rockin' my heart
 Here we go!
 I'm gonna take care of my duties with gusto again today!

 A New Chapter Begins: The Chunin Exam
 Oh!
 Good morning, Sakura!
 Hmph!
 Oh, not again!
 These two...
 They've been sort of strange since we got back from the Land of WavesΓÇª
 Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...
 Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!
 Cha!
 Well... Good morning, everyone...
 Today I got lost.
 Hey!
 Hey, hey...  Kakashi Sensei!
 Our Group Seven always has the easy missions lately!
 Aren't there more exciting missions where I can be more active,
 where I can use my Way of the Ninja and my soulΓÇªyou know?
 Oh yes yes...
 I basically understand what you're trying to say.
 Shoot!
 He's always making me indebted to him
 and making himself look good during our missions!
 I won't lose, no way!
 You little...!
 Today for sure!
 Hmm... You are so much trouble!
 That's what I'd like to say!
 Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto? We're going on our mission!
 Okay!
 You've been so annoying for a while!
 I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!
 Hey you!
 What?
 Oh, Mrs.!
 I've gotten rid of all the weeds!
 What?
 What's wrong?
 Those... those aren't weeds.
 Huh?
 Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!
 SomebodyΓÇªhelpΓÇª!
 No way! Free fall!
 Huh?
 You idiot.
 Hey! 69	01:56:47:23	01:56:50:03 TRAP FIELD 		DO NOT ENTER 		 Don't go over there!
 Hey! Please stop!
 That fool...
 Oh no! That's because he stubbornly chose that big dog.
 Hey, hey! Wait a minute, wait a minute!
 That's the trap field over thereΓÇª
 Yikes!
 Well! It's because you're so reckless!
 Geez, you are so much trouble.
 Zazuge--!
 If you act up any more, I'll finish you!
 MmmΓÇª Teamwork hasn't been good lately.
 That's right, that's right!
 Sasuke, you're to blame for the poor teamwork!
 You're always attracting attention!
 That's you, you idiot.
 If you don't want to owe me big time...
 you just need to become stronger than me!
 It seems like they're getting along worse than before...
 ShootΓÇª 					This is frustrating!
 There're plenty of guys outside who are stronger than I amΓÇª
 Always making me go on this kind of lame mission.
 Well then...
 Perhaps we should disperse.
 I do need to submit a report about this mission.
 Okay, then I'm going home.
 Oh! Hey!
 Sasuke, wait for me!
 Hey, how about... Why don't you andΓÇª
 Why don't we work on improving our teamwork together?
 You're just like Naruto. 100	01:59:31:10	01:59:35:03 		JUST LIKE NARUTO
 If you have time to spend on me, why don't you practice a Jutsu!
 To tell you frankly, your abilities are less than Naruto's!
 LESS THAN NARUTO... CHA!! 		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto! 		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
 That's rightΓÇª
 It's always that way for me during every mission.
 I'll never be able to really do anything at all.
 Sakura! Just let Sasuke be, and let's practice together!
 Huh?
 Sensei disappeared.
 Was he being thoughtful?
 Huh?
 Pretending to beΓÇªa rock?
 There's no such thing as a perfectly square rock with perfect holes!
 It's totally obvious!
 Just what you'd expect from the man I respect!
 You are my rival, aren't you!
 Hey! That's too much gunpowder!
 With an adult sexiness!
 I'm Moegi of the senior class at Kunoichi Preschool!
 I love factoring!
 Udon!
 The most brilliant Ninja in the village! Konohamaru!
 The three of us together are the Konohamaru Gang!
 Here we are!
 I knew it was Konohamaru and friends.
 Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?
 We're just copying what you used to do, bro!
 OhΓÇª
 What's with the oh!
 Your reactions have been pretty cold these days!
 So, did you want something?
 See? Cold.
 So, leader! Do you have some free time now?
 Nah!
 I have to train!
 What?! You said you'd play Ninja with us today!
 OhΓÇª? Is that right?
 GeezΓÇª
 If I played with these guys they would make me hang out all day.
 Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja?
 W-What is it?
 So, abilities less than this guy, huh?
 You are making me blush with those staresΓÇª
 Naruto, who's she?
 She's been staring at him with eyes like she's gonna kill him!
 Oh!
 You've been busier than I thought, bro...
 Huh?
 Is she your...?
 This?
 Shucks, you guys are pretty sharp for kids!
 No way!
 Bro!
 What are you doing?!
 No! Leader!
 His pulse, his pulse ΓÇª!
 You ugly wench! Ugly wench!
 Huh?!
 Nooooo!
 Hmph!
 Are you all right, Konohamaru?
 Oweee...
 Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench! ls she a girl for real?
 Yikes!
 That hurt...
 ΓÇô Huh? 					ΓÇô Huh?
 So, I have formally received the report from you.
 Is Naruto getting along with the others?
 Hmm?
 Well, he's doing okay.
 I've been busy lately.
 I haven't had a chance to see him even once since his return.
 I'm a little concerned...
 As you know, Iruka Sensei, Sasuke is also in our squad,
 and Naruto sees him as a rival, which is a little straining.
 But, the result is that his abilities are developing significantly.
 Almost to the point that he might reach yours,
 the one he respects!
 I seeΓÇª
 I wonder what it is?
 Shoot!
 Right now?
 These guysΓÇª
 Konohamaru!
 That hurt, little punk!
 Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!
 I'm sorryΓÇª I was fooling aroundΓÇª
 What are these two?
 Hey stop! Let go of that hand!
 Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...
 Let's play with them before the strict one comes around.
 Let go!
 You're pretty lively, you little punk...
 You jerk!
 Wha--?! 					What was that?
 Leaf Village's Genin are weaker than I thought.
 T-These guys are foreign...
 Why are they here?
 KonohamaruΓÇª
 Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru!
 It... It hurts ΓÇª
 Hey! If you don't let go of him, I won't forgive you! You fool!
 You're the fool!
 What are you gonna do by getting him worked up!
 You're ticking me off.
 I-I don't like little runts anyway.
 On top of that,
 you're a smart aleck for someone younger than me.
 Makes me want to break him.
 It's not on me.
 What's with this guy? He's crazyΓÇª
 Well, after this little squirt, it's the little runt that won't shut up!
 You!
 Huh?
 What do you think you're doing in someone else's Village, youΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 He's pretty cute.
 Bro!
 Another little punk to tick me off!
 Get lost!
 Wow! So cool!
 Naruto, you're lame!
 S-Stupid! I would've quickly taken down that thug too!
 Hmph!
 Sasuke, you!
 Why're you always, always meddling like this!
 Hey, come down here,  you little punk!
 You're the kind of smart aleck little punk that I despise the most.
 Wait! You aren't thinking of using Crow, are you?!
 Kankuro, stop that.
 Huh?
 You're an embarrassment to our village.
 G-Gaara...
 When did he get next to me?
 It's stealthy footsteps on the level of Kakashi...
 There is no other reason to summon you here other thanΓÇª
 As I assume you already understand,
 based on the faces you can see around...
 So it's already that time...
 The other Lands have already been notified, right?
 I've seen them here and there in the village.
 And, when will it be?
 In a week...
 That's very sudden.
 NowΓÇª I will make the formal announcement.
 Seven days from todayΓÇª
 On the first day of July, the Chunin Exam will begin!
 Yes, yes, yes!
 It's the Chunin Exam, it's the Chunin Exam!
 If I were to win first place or something, becoming a Hokage would be closer!
 There's no way I can lose!
 Konohamaru, you think so too, right?
 What?
 Who the heck snatched up Moegi, and what 're you gonna do?
 Stop, I won't let you get away!
 Next time:  ""Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals""
 As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!

41,"Press down hard on the gas
 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 WeΓÇÖre speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If youΓÇÖre not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so weΓÇÖll go far off into the distance.
 ΓÇªbring it to an end swiftly!
 I wonΓÇÖt let you do anything.
 First move, a surefire victory!
 Wow! ThatΓÇÖs amazing!
 WhatΓÇÖs with his body?!
 I dislocate every joint
 and with Chakra, I can control my softened body at will.
 With ChakraΓÇª?
 I can also squeeze until your bones break.
 IΓÇÖll rapidly tighten as long as you donΓÇÖt give up.
 I donΓÇÖt know what kind of ninja tool youΓÇÖll useΓÇª
 but if I keep doing this to your body, it will make no difference.
 I can break your neck right now.
 So hurry up and give up.
 No.
 Do you want to die?!
 Idiot. YouΓÇÖre the one whoΓÇÖs going to die.
 His neck is broken.
 What?
 How ridiculousΓÇª
 PhewΓÇª
 Idiot.
 I went a little overboard and ended up killing you.
 W-What?
 Okay, now itΓÇÖs my turn.
 T-This is a Puppet!
 T-ThatΓÇÖs the real body?
 HeΓÇÖsΓÇªa Puppet MasterΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖs controlling the puppet with Chakra from his hand!
 G-Give upΓÇª!
 If your bones get crushed, youΓÇÖll be able to bend even more, huh?
 For once, I was close to stopping the match in the middle.
 The winner, by an inability to continue the match by the opponent,
 is Kankuro.
 Two against one is hitting below the belt!
 Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!
 ItΓÇÖs not particularly hitting below the belt.
 ItΓÇÖs a puppet, after all.
 ThatΓÇÖs the Puppet Master Jutsu.
 HeΓÇÖs controlling the puppet with Chakra.
 ItΓÇÖs the same as using a ninja tool-- like shuriken.
 TheyΓÇÖre all great Chakra usersΓÇª
 I thought I could make it kind of far with Chakra.
 Kunoichi Rumble: The Rivals Get Serious!
 InoΓÇª!
 YouΓÇÖve got the jitters, donΓÇÖt you, Sakura?
 WhaΓÇª?!
 Even Sasuke collapsed.
 I mean, it felt like it was because it was Sasuke that it ended at that.
 WhatΓÇÖll happen if you take part?
 It might be best if you quit!
 Something like that wonΓÇÖt work on me!
 ItΓÇÖs okay! I can tough it out this time around, too.
 Quit? Who?
 I can hardly wait.
 Cha! Bring it on!
 Now then, to continue, we will begin the fourth battle.
 Man, man, nothing but weirdoes all over the place!
 DonΓÇÖt you say that!
 YouΓÇÖve got a point.
 You, too, Sakura?!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be laughing.
 Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
 I never thoughtΓÇª IΓÇÖd be fighting you, Sakura.
 And whatΓÇÖs more, so soon.
 Ino was a standout among the rookie Kunoichi.
 With Sakura as her opponent,
 will she goΓÇªno, can she go with serious intent?
 To think it would be those two of all people.
 Things have gotten gloomy.
 I wonder if InoΓÇÖll be okay.
 ThatΓÇÖs for sure.
 WhatΓÇÖre you going to do, Ino?
 Sakura! Good luck! DonΓÇÖt lose!
 Begin!
 Oh, no. I knew it.
 SakuraΓÇÖs totally blowing Ino away!
 Idiot.
 Say what?!
 If youΓÇÖre not an idiot, you must be sleeping, arenΓÇÖt you?
 WhoΓÇª?!
 Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.
 So this is their level of hand-to-hand combat?
 What?!
 ItΓÇÖs not because theyΓÇÖre Kunoichi.
 Huh?
 ItΓÇÖs just that those two are lukewarm. ThereΓÇÖs no man or woman in battle.
 LukewarmΓÇª?
 There!
 Kunoichi must learn not only NinjutsuΓÇª
 but also a wide range of knowledge and refinement as women.
 If you donΓÇÖt blend into enemy territory and conduct yourselves as a normal womanΓÇª
 youΓÇÖll have it rough on occasions such as when you work as spies.
 TodayΓÇÖs class is flower arranging.
 Now then, everyone.
 LetΓÇÖs gather flowers we like.
 Yes, maΓÇÖam!
 Ino, wait up!
 YouΓÇÖre such a klutz.
 IΓÇÖm... not good at stuff like this.
 What about you, Ino?
 ThatΓÇÖs no good, considering your nameΓÇÖs Sakura.
 Listen. There are tricks to things like this.
 You know, as for flower arranging,
 after youΓÇÖve decided on a main flower, you add other flowers to decorate.
 All flowers canΓÇÖt be asserting themselves.
 For exampleΓÇªlook.
 You can see those cosmos flowers over there, rightΓÇª?
 For example, if they were the main flowersΓÇª
 the thoroughwort flowers you picked are throw-ins!
 As contrasted with spring cherry blossoms,
 cosmos flowers have the name of autumn cherry blossom
 and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.
 Also, theyΓÇÖre flowers with the original meaning of ΓÇ£harmony,ΓÇ¥
 so any autumn grass would go perfectly with them.
 So? Do I look as nice as the cosmos flowers?
 Say, say, am I cute?
 UhΓÇªyeah.
 Say. WhatΓÇÖs with the pause?
 You look like youΓÇÖre having so much fun.
 Billboard Brow!
 YouΓÇÖve recently reached adolescence, havenΓÇÖt you?
 DonΓÇÖt get too full of yourself!
 Ami!
 Sorry! You have such a beautiful cylinder-shaped body
 I mistook you for a vase and put flowers in you.
 Ino!
 Shinobi flower aconite.
 It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous, so youΓÇÖd best spit them out.
 Sensei!
 Only the root is poisonous, though.
 Ino is great.
 She knows everything, is stylish, and is cute.
 Even that shuriken skill.
 Her Ninjutsu is great, tooΓÇª
 Compared to that, IΓÇª
 Sakura?
 If youΓÇÖre a cosmos flowerΓÇª
 then am I a thoroughwort?
 WhatΓÇÖre you saying?!
 What?
 Let me seeΓÇª
 In a manner of speaking, you are not a flower, but still a bud!
 YouΓÇÖre right.
 At this point in timeΓÇª
 I donΓÇÖt even plan to fight over Sasuke with you.
 What did you say?
 You and Sasuke donΓÇÖt go together, and IΓÇÖm totally stronger than you!
 You are beneath my notice!
 Sakura! Do you know who youΓÇÖre lipping off to?!
 DonΓÇÖt press your luck, crybaby Sakura! 169.01	01:14:49:11	01:14:50:24	I feel like...
 I feel like Sakura was out of line!
 InoΓÇÖs eyes show incredible anger. SheΓÇÖs scary.
 Hmm. That's not it...
 Huh?
 SakuraΓÇÖs not the kind of kid to do things
 like needlessly flaunt her own power and hurt people.
 She doesnΓÇÖt like having Ino taking pity on her and pulling punches.
 IΓÇÖm a bud, huhΓÇª?
 Say, InoΓÇª
 What?
 WhyΓÇªdid you give this ribbon to me?
 ActuallyΓÇª
 I thought itΓÇÖd be a waste for you to wilt away as a bud.
 ThereΓÇÖs no point if flowers donΓÇÖt bloom.
 For all we knowΓÇª
 it just might...
 become a flower more beautiful than a cosmos.
 Thank you...
 Ino!
 Okay Sakura. LetΓÇÖs hurry and go pick flowers.
 O-Okay.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, Sakura?
 I got some dirt in my eye when I fellΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre so clumsy.
 InoΓÇª
 All along, I believed in the words you gave me then.
 I really thought that it would be nice if it were so.
 It would be nice if I could get a beautiful flower to bloomΓÇª
 I set my sights on you because I wanted to be like you all along.
 Thanks to that, IΓÇÖm here now.
 So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.
 If I canΓÇÖt surpass you at your most serious, thereΓÇÖs no point.
 W-WhatΓÇÖs with Sakura?
 Hmm.
 Why are those two getting that heated?!
 Alas, he doesnΓÇÖt even understand the reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.
 Well, a rival is a mysterious thing, is the point.
 Huh?
 Oh, hiΓÇª
 My rival from youth, KakashiΓÇª
 Oh, how hip and galling that nonsensical reaction is.
 IΓÇª
 got on the same team as Sasuke.
 Why are you telling me nowΓÇª?
 I wonΓÇÖt lose to you anymore, Ino.
 No matter what happens, I wonΓÇÖt lose to you either, Sakura!
 The ribbonΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm giving back the ribbon.
 I gave you that ribbon.
 Besides, a headband is something you put on your head, right?
 From here on, IΓÇÖm no longer a girl who will run after you, Ino.
 When I put this on my head,
 it will be as a female Shinobi who canΓÇÖt lose to you.
 ThatΓÇÖs a good ideaΓÇª
 Me, tooΓÇª
 until that time.
 I understandΓÇªSakura.
 ΓÇô This time for sure... ΓÇô This time for sure...
 ΓÇô with full strengthΓÇª ΓÇô with full strengthΓÇª
 ΓÇô a fairΓÇªfight! ΓÇô a fairΓÇªfight!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Since when did she get this strong?!
 Sure enough, InoΓÇÖs great.
 But I wonΓÇÖt lose. I absolutely will not lose.
 It canΓÇÖt be. SheΓÇÖs evenly matched with me now?!
 IΓÇÖm not who I used to be.
 ΓÇô The next hit is the decisive blow! ΓÇô The next hit is the decisive blow!

 Curse Sealing!
 Out of character.
 It appears heΓÇÖs quite tiredΓÇª
 To think youΓÇÖve become able to handle Sealing JutsuΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖve grown, eh, KakashiΓÇª?
 You...
 Long time no see, Kakashi.
 OrochimaruΓÇª
 Kakashi vs. Orochimaru: Face to Face!
 Sorry, butΓÇª
 I have no business with you, Kakashi.
 But I do with the kid behind you.
 Why are you after SasukeΓÇª?!
 ItΓÇÖs good for you. You already got it, right?
 You didnΓÇÖt have it before, did youΓÇª?
 That.
 That...
 left eye Sharingan!
 I want it, tooΓÇª
 The Uchiha power.
 Come on. Get up.
 W-What?!
 B-Bugs?
 They burst through the skinΓÇª from inside his body?!
 What a creepy guy!
 Heh! What kind of bluff are you trying to pull?
 These things are called Parasitic Insects.
 They attack their pray in groups and eat ChakraΓÇª
 If attacking in this amountΓÇª
 youΓÇÖre finished, no mistake.
 If you donΓÇÖt like that, give up.
 That would be in your best interests.
 If you use your left arm technique on me,
 IΓÇÖll simultaneously have the bugs exploit the opening from behind.
 Conversely, if you use your technique on the bugs,
 IΓÇÖll simultaneously exploit the openingΓÇª
 Either way, you wonΓÇÖt be able to get through this.
 An ace in the hole is something you set aside.
 Hey! Hold it!
 You little thief!
 Someone! Grab him!
 Uh-oh.
 Man, what a pigheaded kid.
 Making us go to trouble!
 You have potential, boy.
 I liked your eyes earlierΓÇª
 If you come with me, you can become strong.
 Follow me.
 If you come with me, you can become strong.
 You can become strong.
 Fight for me. If you do thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll make you stronger.
 Now, please live up to my expectationsΓÇª
 No longer...
 will I...
 It seems like youΓÇÖre proud of your arms. You!
 S-Stop it!
 Stop!
 No longer...
 can I make things blow up in my face!
 DonΓÇÖt... underestimate me!
 An ace in the hole is something you set aside, right?!
 An ace in the hole is something you set aside, right?
 What?! He could already use his right arm?!
 So the first half of the battle was a strategic move
 to make us think he couldnΓÇÖt use his right arm.
 Not badΓÇªZaku.
 WhatΓÇÖs your purpose?
 The recently built Sound Village. ThatΓÇÖs my village, you seeΓÇª
 You already understand, donΓÇÖt youΓÇª?
 Humph! Ridiculous ambition.
 Oh, myΓÇª you said it.
 But, for that I need various pieces who will obey my every whim.
 Take this!
 So Sasuke is one of those pieces?
 No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.
 And the ones who are taking the exams nowΓÇª
 are mere throw-away pieces.
 My arms!
 WhatΓÇÖs this?!
 Earlier when I recommended that you give upΓÇª
 as a precautionary measure, I gave a suggestion to the bugsΓÇª
 to block that troublesome wind hole with their bodies and remain still.
 This is what a real ace in the hole is.
 Punk!
 DonΓÇÖtΓÇªcome any closer... to Sasuke!
 Even if youΓÇÖre one of the legendary three Ninja,
 at the least, I can kill you as you kill me!
 WhatΓÇÖs funny?
 What you say and what you do, are all off.
 What?
 ThereΓÇÖs no point at all in attempting such a seal.
 You understand, donΓÇÖt you?
 The heart to seek out in pursuit of the goal,
 no matter what obstructive power there may beΓÇª
 He is the possessor of that quality.
 HeΓÇÖs an avengerΓÇª
 So you took advantage of that, eh?
 However, Sasuke isΓÇª
 At some point, he will definitely seek me outΓÇª
 in search of power.
 Oh, and, youΓÇÖre going to kill meΓÇª?
 Why donΓÇÖt you try?
 That is, if you canΓÇª
 Kill you as you kill meΓÇª?!
 Am I an idiotΓÇª?
 It seemsΓÇªitΓÇÖs over.
 The winner! Shino Aburame!
 W-What is he, Neji?!
 Byakugan!
 HeΓÇÖs something elseΓÇª!
 I can understand him calling bugs with a Summoning JutsuΓÇª
 but he harbors bugs all over his body.
 S-Say what?!
 HeΓÇÖs of the bug tamer race that is passed down in the Leaf Village.
 Speaking of which, IΓÇÖve heard of itΓÇª
 The story of a race that as they come into this world,
 possess the secret technique of loaning their bodies to bugs
 as a nest and fight using these bugs.
 They fully control the bugs and entrust most of the battle to the bugsΓÇª
 I hear that they contract to keep giving the bugs their own Chakra
 as food for compensation.
 So heΓÇÖsΓÇªthe successor?
 That was unfortunate, Zaku.
 WhyΓÇÖd that happen to ZakuΓÇÖs arms?
 Probably, that guy called Shino or whateverΓÇª
 exploited the opening and stuck those bugs
 into the exhaust opening in ZakuΓÇÖs hands.
 If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave  in that condition,
 the energy with no way out would expand in search of an exitΓÇª
 His arms that are gun barrels blow upΓÇª
 and become useless.
 Our relationship was only that of having been given the same missionΓÇª
 but... IΓÇÖll even the score for you.
 Whew. He gives me a chill, indeedΓÇª
 What?! What?!
 So Shino, you were that strong, werenΓÇÖt you?! Dang it!
 I thought he was a creepy person from long before, butΓÇª
 OhΓÇª
 S-Shino, goodΓÇªworkΓÇª
 Hey, you did it!
 YesΓÇª IΓÇÖm counting on you guys, too.
 He comes back like heΓÇÖs the team leader or something! Dang it!
 Umm, now then, I would like to get right to the next match.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Yo!
 Not, ΓÇ£Yo!ΓÇ¥ Kakashi Sensei!
 What about Sasuke? Is he okay?
 Well, heΓÇÖs fine.
 HeΓÇÖs sleeping soundly in the infirmary.
 However, with Anbu Ops standing as guardsΓÇª
 Oh.
 Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro
 ItΓÇÖs finally my turn.
 Kankuro, heΓÇÖs totally underestimating thisΓÇª
 Humph. IdiotΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs himΓÇª!
 Unlike Yoroi, I donΓÇÖt get careless with kids at all.
 IΓÇÖll say this first, once I do my techniqueΓÇª
 give up no matter whatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll bring it to an end swiftly.
 If so, IΓÇÖll alsoΓÇª
 bring it to an end swiftly!
 Now then, please beginΓÇª
 the third battle!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever

 It's been nothing but blah missions so far!
 Knock it off!
 Naruto!
 It's necessary to explain to you what a mission isΓÇª
 Listen to me!
 Requests pour into the village every day.
 They range from babysitting to assassinationsΓÇª
 A wide spectrum of requests are recorded on the request listΓÇª
 They are separated into A, B, C, and D ranks in order of difficulty.
 In the village, everyone below me
 is divided up by ability in the order of Jonin, Chunin, and Genin.
 We at the highest level distribute the requests as missions
 to Ninjas who have abilities that suit said mission.
 And, if the mission is successful, the fee comes in from the client.
 Nevertheless, you guys have just become GeninΓÇª
 rank D is about the best you can doΓÇª
 Hm?!
 Yesterday's lunch was pork-bone broth noodles,
 so today will be miso brothΓÇª

 Or, a princess?!
 Don't get so hasty.

 HuhΓÇª?

 What good will it do to kill the old man
 you're supposed to be guarding, you moron?!

 You'll be risking life and limb in guarding me to the max
 until I return to my land and complete my bridge!
 All right!
 We're off!!
 What're you so excited about?!
 You see, I've never left the village before!
 Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?!
 I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him. There's no need to worry.
 ...okay with this squirt?!
 Anyone but this old dude, manΓÇª
 He's really the worst client!
 I'll tell him a thing or twoΓÇª
 Hey, old man!
 Don't be mocking Ninjas so much!
 I'm awesome, you see!
 I'm a super-elite Ninja who will be called Hokage one day!
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki.
 Remember it well!!
 The Hokage's the super top-dog Ninja in the village, right?
 You sure as heck don't seem like you could become the HokageΓÇª
 Aaah! Shut up!
 I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to become the Hokage!
 You'll have no choice but to acknowledge me then!!
 I'll never acknowledge you, squirtΓÇª
 Even if you become the Hokage!
 What?! I'll kill you!
 I told you to stop it, you moron!
 No! At least let me have one shot, just oneΓÇª
 SayΓÇªMr.TazunaΓÇª?
 What is it?
 Your country is  ""The Land of the Waves,""  right?
 What of it?
 Say, Kakashi SenseiΓÇª
 Are there Ninjas in that land, too?
 No, there aren't Ninjas in the Land of the WavesΓÇª
 But in other nations, while cultures and customs are different,
 hidden villages exist, and there are Ninjas there.
 To the many nations on the continent,
 the existence of Shinobi Villages is a measure of the nation's military strength.
 In other words,
 that is how these nations maintain their relationships with neighboring nations.
 Even so, the villages are not under the control of the nations.
 They are equal in rank.
 On a small island like the Land of the Waves,
 where it is difficult to be influenced by other nations,
 there is no need for a Shinobi village.
 Among the respective nations that possess a Shinobi Village,
 the five nations of ""Fire,"" ""Water,"" ""Lightning,"" ""Wind,"" and ""Earth,""
 due to their large territory and immeasurable power,
 are called the ""Five Great Nations.""
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves of the Land of Fire,
 the Village Hidden in the Mist of the Land of Water,
 the Village Hidden in the Clouds of the Land of Lightning,
 the Village Hidden in the Sand of the Land of Wind,
 the Village Hidden in the Rocks of the Land of Earth.
 Only the leaders of each of these Hidden Villages
 are allowed to have the name of Kage, the Shadow.
 The ""Hokage"" (Fire shadow),""
 ""Mizukage"" 					(Water Shadow),
 ""Raikage"" (Lightning Shadow),
 ""Kazekage"" 					(Wind Shadow),
 ""Tsuchikage"" (Earth Shadow),
 the so-called Five Kage (shadows),
 reign supreme over the tens of thousands of Ninjas
 in each nation of the whole world.
 No kiddingΓÇª Lord Hokage is that incredible!
 I wonder if that blah old man is really that incredibleΓÇª
 Sounds fishy!
 That can't be true! No way!
 Hey!
 You guys just doubted Lord Hokage now, didn't youΓÇª?
 WellΓÇªdon't worry.
 There are no Ninja battles in Rank C missions.
 Then, there's no worry of getting into a scrape with foreign NinjasΓÇª!
 Of course, not.
 What?!
 Huh?!
 W-What?
 The first one!
 K-Kakashi Sensei!
 The second oneΓÇª
 The second oneΓÇª
 OhhhΓÇª!
 Hm?!
 It doesn't come off!
 WΓÇªWow!!
 Whoa!
 Ugh!!
 They'll come!
 I have to do itΓÇª I have to!!
 Get back, sir!!
 YoΓÇª
 Kakashi SenseiΓÇª! He's alive!
 Humph! 					Show offΓÇª
 Whaa--?!
 Then, what was thatΓÇª?
 So Kakashi SenseiΓÇªused SubstitutionsΓÇª
 NarutoΓÇª Sorry I didn't help you right awayΓÇª
 I got you hurt.
 I didn't think you'd be incapable of movingΓÇª
 I was saved, somehowΓÇª
 Anyhow, let me just say, good job, Sasuke.
 You, too, Sakura.
 IΓÇªcouldn't do anythingΓÇª
 but SasukeΓÇª
 It was his first real battleΓÇª
 Didn't he feel scared, at all?
 He saved me like it was nothing and without getting any dirt on his clothesΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª
 Huh?!
 Are you hurtΓÇª
 scaredy cat...?
 Sasuke!
 Naruto!
 These guys have poison on their claws.
 You need to take out the poison quickly.
 What?!
 You have to open the wound and drain the poisoned blood.
 Don't move so much.
 The poison will spread.
 By the way, Mr. TazunaΓÇª
 W-What is itΓÇª?!
 I have something to talk to you about.
 Chunin from the Village Hidden in the MistΓÇª
 These guys are Ninjas known for continuing to fight
 no matter what the sacrifice.
 How were you able to detect our movements?
 There probably wouldn't be  puddles of water
 on a clear day like today, when it hasn't rained for days.
 Knowing that, why'd you leave it to the kids to fight?
 If I felt like it, I could kill these guys instantlyΓÇª
 ButΓÇª 					I had to know...
 who the target of these enemies wasΓÇª
 Hm?! What do you mean?
 In other words...
 what I mean is I had to know if it was you,
 or one of us ShinobiΓÇª who was being targeted.
 We haven't heard anything about you being targeted by Ninjas.
 The content of the request was supposed to just be
 protection from gangs, thieves, and the likeΓÇª
 This is a mission with a B rank or higher.
 The request was supposed to be
 for backup protection until you finished building your bridgeΓÇª
 If our enemies were to be Ninjas,
 the mission would've been estimated without question
 as an expensive  ""B Rank""  mission.
 It appears there's some kind of good reason for this,
 but being lied to in the request won't do.
 This is beyond the scope of our mission.
 This mission is too soon for usΓÇª
 Let's give it up!
 We need an anesthetic to open Naruto's wound
 and get out the poisoned bloodΓÇª
 We have to return to the village and take him to a doctorΓÇª
 HmmmΓÇª
 Hm? What...?!
 This sure is a burden!
 Since we need to treat Naruto's wound, shall we go back to the villageΓÇª?
 Huh!
 Oh!
 Why am I so different?!
 Why's it always meΓÇª Darn it!
 Naruto! What're you doing?!
 I should be getting strongerΓÇª
 Here I'm steadily carrying out missions and
 doing special-skill training by myself every dayΓÇª
 I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued.
 I'll never be afraid or a be a cowardΓÇª
 I won't lose to SasukeΓÇª
 I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!
 I'll protect you, old manΓÇª with this Kunai knife!!
 The mission continues!!
 NarutoΓÇª
 It's all well and good to rid yourself of the poisoned blood,
 but any more than that and you'll bleed to death.
 Things will get hairy if you don't stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!
 Yikes!
 Argh! No! No!
 I can't die like this, I say!
 Show me your hand.
 Nooo! Help me!!
 Naruto!
 You're really self-abusive, aren't you!
 That's masochistic!
 The wound isΓÇª
 already starting to healΓÇª
 UmΓÇªumΓÇª
 Am I okay? You look awfully seriousΓÇª
 WellΓÇªYou should be okay.
 Is itΓÇªthe power of the Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇª?
 Did you say you failed?!
 I paid a lot of money to hire you guys
 because you said you were once hot-shot Ninjas!
 Stop your darned grumblingΓÇª!!
 Next time, I'll kill him with thisΓÇª head chopper!
 I-It's really okay, right?!
 It seems that the enemy has hired good NinjasΓÇª
 On top of that, a tightened guard on account of the Demon Brothers' failure
 means that it won't be easyΓÇª
 Just who do you think I am?!
 This Zabuza Momochi, who is called the demon ofΓÇª
 the Hidden Mist!!
 We've finally landed ashore in the Land of the Waves.
 The guys before were all well and good,
 but there should be even stronger guys lying in wait.
 Okay! I'm going to regain my honor and continue the mission.
 No matter what enemy comes,
 I'll protect the old man this time around for sure.
 Oh, they wasted no time.
 An impressive-looking guy with a huge Katana has come.
 Next episode:  ""The Assassin of the Mist!""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

 My body movements have finally returnedΓÇª
 BloodΓÇª
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! WhatΓÇÖs happening?!
 WhyΓÇÖs Kabuto fighting with Old Lady Tsunade?!
 Take a good look at the headband!
 HeΓÇÖs OrochimaruΓÇÖs subordinate.
 Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
 That man is OrochimaruΓÇª
 Shizune, you take care of the guy with the glassesΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll take care of Orochimaru.
 Before that, IΓÇÖd like to have Tsunade do something about this body.
 The effects of that drug might still last for awhileΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing that I can do about it.
 What? Really?
 Geez. I guess it canΓÇÖt be helped.
 I have no choice but to fight in this condition.
 TsunadeΓÇª Rest your body with Recovery Ninjutsu.
 ThenΓÇª What about me, me?
 You guard Tsunade together with that pig.
 What?! I want to fight, too. Even I can--
 No, you wonΓÇÖt!
 Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
 YouΓÇÖre on a different level.
 The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
 and the man who killed the Third Hokage.
 An eye for an eyeΓÇª IΓÇÖm the only one who can fight him.
 And that four-eyed guy possesses the same level of power as Kakashi.
 Okay.
 ThenΓÇª Shadow Clo--
 Hold it!
 DonΓÇÖt use the Shadow Clone Jutsu. ltΓÇÖd be utterly pointless.
 What?
 It wouldnΓÇÖt even become much of a diversionΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖd be a waste of ChakraΓÇª
 with them as opponents.
 Now then, letΓÇÖs get this thing started.
 ΓÇô Summoning Jutsu. ΓÇô Summoning Jutsu.
 Hi.
 ΓÇô Huh?! 					ΓÇô What is this?!
 ΓÇô Wha--?! ΓÇô What the heckΓÇÖs going on?!
 Long time no see.
 On account of the drug,
 Master Jiraiya still canΓÇÖt build up Chakra very well.
 It looks like your stupid still hasnΓÇÖt healed, eh, Jiraiya.
 ThatΓÇÖs too much even for you with no ability.
 It seems Tsunade got you with something.
 A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
 so perhaps she was thinking ahead and drugged him
 with something that would contain his power.
 To think sheΓÇÖd make a sacrifice of JiraiyaΓÇª
 Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
 To think IΓÇÖd already have my handicap spotted.
 You are such a disgraceful guy as alwaysΓÇª
 Dang it. It kind of ticks me off when the Pervy Sage is mocked.
 SummoningΓÇªJutsu!
 The Nine-Tailed Fox kid from the Chunin Exam.
 I wonder if I shouldΓÇÖve killed him then, after all.
 For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
 I acknowledged his achievementΓÇª and let him slide by.
 But the only ones who can break a Five-Pronged Spell
 are the Sannin members and the Third Hokage.
 Which means Jiraiya may have already taught it to Naruto.
 Perhaps.
 If heΓÇÖs able to control the Nine-Tailed FoxΓÇÖs powerΓÇª
 OhΓÇª
 Th-This isΓÇª
 It doesnΓÇÖt quite look to be so.
 He isnΓÇÖt endowed with Shinobi ability to begin with, soΓÇª
 Why?
 HeΓÇÖs still got a long way to go, sure enough.
 Why?!
 Hello.
 Hey, Gamatatsu. Why did you come out?
 Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
 ItΓÇÖs the first time IΓÇÖve been Summoned.
 I-I wonder if I can do my best?
 Idiot. Get some snacks or something and hide.
 What? I can get snacks? Goody-goody.
 Here I go.
 IΓÇÖll take Jiraiya.
 I leave the rest to you.
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunateΓÇª
 Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya, one of the Sannin.
 Naruto!
 Your opponent is me.
 Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
 Dang it. I canΓÇÖt completely sink them with such a puny swamp.
 The drug is still working.
 ButΓÇªwith this, the snakes canΓÇÖt move.
 Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
 IΓÇÖll be up a creek if I take even one breath.
 My leg tendonsΓÇª!
 I wonΓÇÖt be eaten twiceΓÇª! No way!
 Here I go.
 Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
 Dang itΓÇªThe Jutsu isnΓÇÖt working well.
 Even if we both have handicaps, you wonΓÇÖt one-up meΓÇª
 Give up now.
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunateΓÇª
 Here I had respected you as a fellow Medical Ninja.
 Stop. Stay back!
 Please hang on, Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru is also called, will cry.
 My bodyΓÇÖs heavy.
 To think you who were once called the village madness
 would ferry around such a kid and struggle tirelessly for the village.
 YouΓÇÖve really fallen, havenΓÇÖt you?
 I have a keen eye to discern ability.
 And that kidΓÇªis mediocrity in my eyes.
 ItΓÇÖs precisely for this reasonΓÇª that I donΓÇÖt need the Uchiha kid.
 ItΓÇÖs no fun raising a genius whoΓÇÖs good from the start.
 So you canΓÇÖt leave him alone
 because itΓÇÖs like youΓÇÖre looking at your old self?
 That kid canΓÇÖt beat Uchiha who inherited the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
 And thatΓÇÖs because Naruto doesnΓÇÖt possess the Sharingan.
 Shinobi ability is about whether
 one can use and master all the Jutsu of the world.
 Ninja refers to one who can use Ninjutsu.
 Shinobi ability is no such thing.
 You still donΓÇÖt get it?
 A NinjaΓÇªis one who endures.
 ItΓÇÖs a difference of opinion, huh.
 IΓÇÖll teach you one thing.
 WhatΓÇÖs most important for Shinobi abilityΓÇª
 isnΓÇÖt the number of Jutsu one possesses.
 WhatΓÇÖs important isΓÇª
 The mettleΓÇª
 not to give up.
 Enough alreadyΓÇªyou jerk!
 The mettle to never give upΓÇª
 He possesses that.
 Heh. I donΓÇÖt know what Jutsu you learned,
 but you canΓÇÖt hit me with such a large motion.
 No good.
 It wonΓÇÖt easily hit with a moving opponent.
 Owwee!
 And the Chakra isnΓÇÖt completely held, yetΓÇª
 It seems you got a cracked thigh bone in your left leg
 from the battle with the snake.
 Well, you can still move if itΓÇÖs just the bone.
 But itΓÇÖs impossible nowΓÇª
 The lateral vastus muscle in your right leg is totally cut off.
 What should I doΓÇª?
 That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
 If even one arm is taken out, itΓÇÖs over.
 Are you scared of me?
 Do you want to run away from here?
 Naruto, as I recall,
 you whooped it up like this during the first Chunin Exam.
 DonΓÇÖt mess with me. I wonΓÇÖt run away!
 ""DonΓÇÖt mess with me. I wonΓÇÖt run away.""
 ""IΓÇÖll take it. Even if IΓÇÖm a Genin for lifeΓÇª""
 ""IΓÇÖll become the Hokage at any cost, so itΓÇÖs okay with me.""
 ""IΓÇÖm not scared.""
 Can youΓÇª whoop it up in the same way now?
 Unlike youΓÇª
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name no matter what!
 ΓÇô Hokage is my dream! ΓÇô Hokage is my dream!
 YouΓÇÖre not a kid anymore, so you should stop whooping it upΓÇª
 Depending on the situation,
 when you want to give up and run away, you should run away.
 Oh myΓÇª WhatΓÇÖs with that look?
 YouΓÇÖll die! If you die, there are no dreams or anythingΓÇª
 Do you want to die?
 YouΓÇÖre still a Genin, so you should run away on the battlefield.
 DonΓÇÖt tell a man to run away.
 Kids think that everything is easy.
 ThatΓÇÖs why they talk about foolish dreams like nothing at all.
 ThatΓÇÖs why they canΓÇÖt give up.
 Jiraiya, was it you who taught him that Rasengan?
 Are you acting like a teacher by teaching a Jutsu that canΓÇÖt be learned?
 DonΓÇÖt give him false hopes.
 ThatΓÇÖs why a moony kid starts joking that heΓÇÖll become the Hokage!
 They chase after foolish dreamsΓÇª and then die.
 If I have three days, IΓÇÖll master that Jutsu.
 Then let's make a bet.
 Bastard!
 As for meΓÇª I stand by my words.
 ThatΓÇÖsΓÇªmy Way of Ninja!
 A bet?
 IΓÇÖll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 IΓÇÖll acknowledge that youΓÇÖll be able to become the HokageΓÇª
 and give you this necklace.
 You shouldΓÇÖve just stayed out of thisΓÇª
 Why?
 Why?!
 Old Lady TsunadeΓÇª
 YouΓÇÖre still going to get up?
 Just like our wager
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone wonΓÇÖt do anything now.
 EnoughΓÇª DonΓÇÖt protect me, Naruto. Stop it!
 I told you that youΓÇÖd die if you were obstinate like that, right?
 If you die, there will be no dreams, no nothing.
 Just get out of the way. Run away.
 HumphΓÇª ItΓÇÖs okay.
 IΓÇª
 I absolutely will not dieΓÇª
 until I become the Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you. Here I go!
 ItΓÇÖs the same Chakra movement as before.
 No, this isΓÇªdifferent.
 I see.
 In order to gain a hand for suppressing Chakra,
 the Shadow CloneΓÇª
 Compress Chakra andΓÇª
 hold it completely.
 Wha--?!
 I-It canΓÇÖt be.
 Rasengan!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 ΓÇ£Each one of us glows differently,ΓÇ¥
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 LetΓÇÖs promise we wonΓÇÖt cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 I never forget my idealΓÇª
 to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf and protect its people.
 The Hokages have sacrificed their lives for that dream.
 And now, I also will put my life on the line.
 From this moment, I am the Fifth Hokage!
 Next time: ""The Fifth Hokage! A Life on the Line!""

 ThatΓÇÖs right, thereΓÇÖs no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 I donΓÇÖt even plan to fight over Sasuke with you.
 Sakura!
 Do you know who youΓÇÖre lipping off to?!
 DonΓÇÖt press your luck, crybaby Sakura!
 It seems like... it seems like Sakura was out of line!
 InoΓÇÖs eyes show incredible anger. SheΓÇÖs scary.
 Hmm.
 That's not itΓÇª
 Huh?
 SakuraΓÇÖs not the kind of kid to do things
 like needlessly flaunt her own power and hurt people.
 She doesnΓÇÖt like having Ino taking pity on her and pulling punches.
 ΓÇô This time for sure, ΓÇô This time for sure,

 repel off the ground!
 Fast!
 If you think IΓÇÖm the crybaby Sakura I was until recently,
 youΓÇÖll get your fingers burned!
 Come like you mean it, Ino!
 I appreciate you saying thatΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll go like I mean it, as you wish!
 Way to go Sakura!
 Great!
 Really great!
 With the fundamental movements using Chakra,
 sheΓÇÖs topnotch among the rookiesΓÇª
 Huh?
 Sakura is at her best.
 That meansΓÇª ls she better than me?
 Well!
 ThatΓÇÖs right.
 Awww!
 Sending Chakra all throughout the body and
 using the technique with it at a right timingΓÇª
 Those techniques alone are better than Sasuke.
 Well, from the start, she was extremely good atΓÇª
 controlling her Chakra, soΓÇª
 Magnificent movements, Sakura!
 However, her opponent is good too.
 This evenly-matched battle looks to take awhile!
 Since when did this girl get this strong?!
 I can make it, tooΓÇª!
 You littleΓÇª!
 Whoa!
 At this rate, itΓÇÖll never end.
 This is longΓÇª
 TheyΓÇÖve been going at it for ten minutes, at the least.
 You shouldnΓÇÖt be evenly matched with me!
 What makes you think IΓÇÖm evenly matched with youΓÇª
 whoΓÇÖs only concerned with looks and growing your hair frivolously?!
 You!
 You carry your mocking of me too far!
 Idiot.
 SheΓÇÖs going for the bait.
 Who knows what Ino will do!
 I donΓÇÖt like Ino when sheΓÇÖs that wayΓÇª!
 YouΓÇÖre simple-mindedΓÇª
 Uh-oh.
 SheΓÇÖs totally lost it!
 I donΓÇÖt need this!
 S-ScaryΓÇª
 IΓÇÖll put an end to this right now!
 IΓÇÖll make you say that you lost!
 Hey, donΓÇÖt tell meΓÇª
 Could it beΓÇª?
 As I recall, that Sign isΓÇª
 I knew itΓÇª
 SheΓÇÖs planning to do the Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 ManΓÇªThat idiot!
 I understand your feelings of frustration, but thatΓÇÖs futile.
 Humph!
 I wonder!
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer JutsuΓÇª
 A Jutsu where the user can take over the opponentΓÇÖs spirit
 and wrest their body away for a few minutesΓÇª
 by discharging all of their own spiritual energy
 and striking the enemy with it.
 But, there are major flaws to this formidable Jutsu.
 First, the discharged spiritual energy can only fly straight and at a slow speed.
 Second, even in the case of failing to hit the enemy and missing,
 the user canΓÇÖt return to her own body for several minutes.
 I should add that during that interval, the userΓÇÖs,
 in other words, your main body will turn into a doll that wonΓÇÖt move at all!
 In the first place,
 the Mind Transfer Jutsu is used for spying and is not a Jutsu for battle.
 Ino, using that Jutsu here would be equal to suicideΓÇª
 It shouldnΓÇÖt be particularly scary if she moves aboutΓÇª
 And not only that, if she dodges the Jutsu,
 she can beat the heck out of the non-moving opponent.
 If that happens, Hayate will be forced to put an end to the matchΓÇª
 So what?!
 I wonΓÇÖt know unless I try!
 If you miss, itΓÇÖs over.
 You know that, right?
 In the first place, itΓÇÖs a combination Jutsu to be used
 after stopping the opponentΓÇÖs movements during a battle
 with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 ThereΓÇÖs no way!
 There is no way, it will hitΓÇª
 Idiot! Stop!
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Which oneΓÇª?
 That was unfortunateΓÇª
 Ino.
 Has the fat lady sungΓÇª?
 She went and did itΓÇª
 Then, itΓÇÖs over, eh.
 This isΓÇª?!
 You fell for it, Sakura!
 I finally caught you!
 It can't be!
 Yes, it can.
 My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,
 to drive you who was running about into this contrivance.
 So?
 You canΓÇÖt move at all, can you?
 ItΓÇÖs special rope thatΓÇÖs my hair with Chakra poured in!
 With this, it will be over when I enter your body and say ΓÇ£give up!ΓÇ¥
 It wouldnΓÇÖt miss a hundred percent of the time!
 I seeΓÇª
 That idiotΓÇª Her losing it was also an act?
 Get out of there, Sakura!
 I canΓÇÖt moveΓÇª!
 ThenΓÇª
 Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 That was unfortunateΓÇª
 She missed!
 No!
 SakuraΓÇª
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 W-WhatΓÇÖs with Ino?
 Also... SakuraΓÇÖs acting kind of strange! Believe it!
 ButΓÇªsurely this is her chance!
 Do it, Sakura!
 ItΓÇÖs no use.
 To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu thereΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇÖs had it.
 Mind TransferΓÇª?!
 That means Sakura right now isΓÇª
 Yes.
 SakuraΓÇÖs spirit has been completely taken over by Ino.
 What?!
 Ino is inside of SakuraΓÇÖs body now!
 Well.
 InoΓÇÖs purpose is most likelyΓÇª
 With this, itΓÇÖs over.
 Good bye, SakuraΓÇª
 IΓÇªSakura Haruno concedeΓÇª
 ΓÇô this matchΓÇª 					ΓÇô No!
 Sakura!
 Tsk!
 HeΓÇÖs annoying!
 You did your hardest to get here!
 YouΓÇÖll disgrace women if you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
 Like I said, those words are uselessΓÇª
 What's...
 this bad chillΓÇª?!
 Naruto is annoying!
 Anyway, thatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª not to Ino I wonΓÇÖt ΓÇª
 Sakura?!
 This canΓÇÖt be happeningΓÇª
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?
 Are you conceding?
 I wonΓÇÖt be conceding!

 W-WhatΓÇÖs going on?!
 SakuraΓÇª?!
 No way!
 I messed up my JutsuΓÇª?
 InoΓÇªYouΓÇÖll have a terrible time of it if you donΓÇÖt get out of me quick!
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong, with Ino?
 NoΓÇª I wonΓÇÖt hold on at this rateΓÇª
 Release!
 It canΓÇÖt beΓÇª She shattered InoΓÇÖs Jutsu!
 She used too much energy before the JutsuΓÇª
 So she didnΓÇÖt have enough ChakraΓÇª?!
 To think she has two spiritsΓÇª What are you?!
 Strength that ranks with beauty.
 Girls canΓÇÖt survive if theyΓÇÖre not tough!
 If caught in that spell,
 itΓÇÖs not that easy to cast out the invaderΓÇª
 InoΓÇÖs lack of ChakraΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs also thatΓÇª
 But what was more effective  than thatΓÇª
 was the combative spirit towards lno she has inside her heart.
 So that was awakened with NarutoΓÇÖs voice as the trigger and she cast Ino outΓÇª?
 ThereΓÇÖs nothing to it.
 Like NarutoΓÇª
 SakuraΓÇÖs fighting spirit was much stronger than others.
 ΓÇô This isΓÇª! 					ΓÇô This isΓÇª!
 But, both of them should have hardly any Chakra left.
 ΓÇô This isΓÇª 					ΓÇô This isΓÇª
 ΓÇô the end! 					ΓÇô the end!
 Both parties are unable to continue the match!
 By double knockout,
 no one gets through the fourth battle of the preliminary!
 ΓÇô What?! 					ΓÇô Huh?!
 Now then...
 Good grief.
 Hey, Ino!
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 A-A-Are you okay?!
 TreatmentΓÇÖs not necessary.
 TheyΓÇÖll probably wake up after awhile.
 But, that was surprisingΓÇª
 YeahΓÇª
 Naruto and Sasuke asideΓÇª
 to think even that Sakura who didnΓÇÖt have what it took has grown this muchΓÇª
 A lot happened,
 but I really feel like it was a good thingΓÇª
 sending her to this Chunin Exam.
 Tenten vs. Temari
 Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
 NowΓÇª
 The second one from the Land of Sand, huhΓÇª
 ΓÇô This looks to be an interesting match. ΓÇô Do your best, Tenten!
 It looks like you finally woke up, ehΓÇªSakura.
 Huh?!
 Tenten, power of youth!
 Go Go!
 There is no limit to your youth!
 Our match is already over.
 Did IΓÇªlose?
 IΓÇÖm the one who wants to cryΓÇª
 To think I tied with somebody like youΓÇª
 Huh?
 Here!
 You also got a flower to bloom, didnΓÇÖt you?
 A beautiful flower!
 InoΓÇª
 However...
 the next time we fight,
 it wonΓÇÖt end with you getting knocked out!
 HmΓÇª?!
 AndΓÇª I wonΓÇÖt hand over Sasuke to you!
 I return the same line to you!
 ΓÇô Humph! 					ΓÇô Humph!
 The fifth battleΓÇª
 Tenten, TemariΓÇª come forward!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else IΓÇÖll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 ItΓÇÖs all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 You know! You know!
 I feel like women battles are incredible, orΓÇª
 Women are scary.
 Huh?
 Hey-hey!
 This isnΓÇÖt the time to be withdrawing, Shikamaru.
 YouΓÇÖre kind of a plain, or a lousy, or an unimpressive guy, arenΓÇÖt you?
 If you donΓÇÖt really put your whole heart into it, things will get hairy for you.

 More importantly these people arenΓÇÖt normal, Pervy Sage!
 Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!
 Like I said, donΓÇÖt call me ΓÇ£Pervy SageΓÇ¥!
 You are, after all, Master Jiraiya, one of the legendary SanninΓÇª
 I didnΓÇÖt believe that IΓÇÖd be able to stop you so easily
 despite the fact that you are a huge womanizer.
 What?!
 You know the true identity of Pervy Sage?!
 Well no, thatΓÇÖs not necessarily who I really amΓÇª
 Seems like you released the Genjutsu that we had put on that woman.
 You shouldnΓÇÖt call yourself a man for using such a cowardly tactic
 like casting a Genjutsu on the woman with your hypnotic eyes
 to separate me and Naruto.
 Separate usΓÇª Why would they do that?
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 You are after the Nine-Tailed Fox in NarutoΓÇª
 No wonder Kakashi knew that as wellΓÇª
 I see clearly now. The information source was you.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 WhatΓÇÖs going onΓÇª?
 I canΓÇÖt let you have NarutoΓÇª
 I wonder about that.

 Why is that?
 He doesnΓÇÖt show any mercy.

 You are weak.
 And you are weakΓÇª
 because you donΓÇÖt have enough hate.

 Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!
 How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.
 You guys are already inside my stomach!
 I summoned the esophagus of the giant toad
 of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.
 You guys are wanted criminals anyway.
 IΓÇÖll turn you guys into fodder for the stone toad.
 What?!
 Wh-What is this?
 Naruto, you stay still!
 DonΓÇÖt worry, itΓÇÖs my Jutsu!
 Come here, Kisame!
 Oh!
 Darn it!
 ItΓÇÖs useless!
 There hasnΓÇÖt been one person who has been able to escape from this!
 A wall of flesh is charging at us!
 The wall is faster.
 At this rateΓÇª
 HeyΓÇª
 Pervy Sage!
 WhatΓÇÖs the matter?!
 Huh!
 TheyΓÇÖve gone!
 I cannot believe that this wall has been torn throughΓÇª
 Why must we retreat? You would beΓÇª
 We have no reason to rush to get Naruto in the current condition.
 Besides, I have to rest my body somewhere for a while.
 Not just Tsukuyomi,
 but he also made me use Amaterasu as wellΓÇª
 What is this fire?
 ItΓÇÖs blackΓÇª
 DonΓÇÖt get so close!
 How did those guys manage to get out?
 Not only thatΓÇª
 What are these black flames?
 The stone toad who has the ability to blow fire had its intestineΓÇÖs burnedΓÇª

 Guy?!
 Entry!
 WellΓÇª EhΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry to have kicked you so directly.
 I was in a rush and I forgot my mirrorΓÇª
 I used this headband instead, but it was hard to see.
 And I assumed this rough-hewn face was the enemyΓÇª
 I just let the flames of the burning juvenescence take over meΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm sorry!
 Is that ΓÇª supposed to be an apology?
 IΓÇÖm a simple-minded guy just like how my face looks.
 It doesnΓÇÖt really matter.
 More importantly, we have to get Sasuke to the Medical Team!
 Yes!
 HeΓÇÖs broken his arm and ribs.
 Not only that, heΓÇÖs lost consciousness
 from some kind of mental blow he received from the Visual Jutsu!
 This boy also experienced that JutsuΓÇª
 Hey Pervy Sage! ls Sasuke going to be all right?
 Seems like heΓÇÖs received a significant amount of mental damage.
 IΓÇÖm going to kill you!
 Die!
 You jerk!
 YouΓÇÖre in the way!
 DarnΓÇª Why?!
 What did that guy do to Sasuke?!
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 WeΓÇÖve gotta change our plan!
 I got scared earlier,
 but this time IΓÇÖm going to chase those black-capes and get them!
 ItΓÇÖs me that they want, right?!
 Then, IΓÇÖll be the one to make my way over!
 Humph, youΓÇÖre only going to be killed if you go now.
 TheyΓÇÖre at a totally different level from you.
 I just managed to get you away from themΓÇª
 Then, are we just going to keep running away?!
 Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!
 Shut your mouth for a second!
 You are weak.
 IΓÇÖm sorry, Guy.
 I thought that I had spared the boyΓÇÖs feeling, butΓÇª
 I should have saved him much sooner.
 Kakashi has also come down with the same JutsuΓÇª
 We donΓÇÖt know when he will regain consciousness.
 Kakashi Sensei?!
 When my students are hurtΓÇª
 I always wish, from the bottom of my heartΓÇª
 If that person, who is a medical specialist, were hereΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs why weΓÇÖre going to go find her now.
 What?
 You mean, her?
 Could it beΓÇª?
 W-WaitΓÇª!
 C-Could this money beΓÇª?!
 Yup, thatΓÇÖs rightΓÇª
 The one who uses the slug and drives illness away,
 and who is also one of the Sannin like meΓÇª
 All right! WeΓÇÖre going to turn around our luck with this!
 Princess Tsunade with the letter ΓÇ£GambleΓÇ¥ on her back!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 ItΓÇÖs festival, festival, festival!
 IΓÇÖm going to spend like thereΓÇÖs no tomorrow!
 Wait a minute, Naruto! I will keep your wallet for you.
 Huh?!
 ItΓÇÖs been said since ages past that three forbidden factors:
 money, alcohol, and women, are believed to cause Ninja failures.
 I am not like you, Pervy Sage!

 Some of you have probably already heard butΓÇª
 Gekko HayateΓÇÖs corpse was found near Kikyo CastleΓÇª
 WhatΓÇª Hayate?
 No wayΓÇª
 ThatΓÇÖs ridiculous!
 Is the opponent Orochimaru?
 NoΓÇªwe shouldnΓÇÖt jump to that conclusion so easily.
 The one Hayate was following was likely a Sound spy called KabutoΓÇª
 Well, itΓÇÖs certain that Orochimaru is trying to do something butΓÇª
 SoΓÇªweΓÇÖll cancel Chunin Exam and go after OrochimaruΓÇª?!
 No, he revealed his identity to AnkoΓÇª
 sending us a threat not to cancel.
 Not to cancel the Chunin Exam
 for which all of the Ninja of the Alliance have gathered!
 What does it mean?
 Orochimaru possesses enough power to take down a small Land on his own.
 HeΓÇÖs a Ninja that probably every land has eyes on.
 Moreover, he conveniently holds a grudge
 against this Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Any Land would desire him.
 So could it beΓÇª
 that any Land in the Alliance would unite with Orochimaru
 and betray the Village Hidden in the Leaves?!
 Well, the Alliance Treaty is at the same level as a verbal agreement!
 As was in the former Great Ninja WarΓÇª
 In any case,
 thereΓÇÖs too little information right now.
 LetΓÇÖs end these unnecessary suspicions.
 WeΓÇÖve already dispatched Anbu,
 the black ops to each Land to collect information.
 ItΓÇÖs dangerous to act carelesslyΓÇª
 That could be what the enemy is aiming for.
 And alsoΓÇª
 I trust all of you!
 When the time comes,
 weΓÇÖll bring all the powers of Hidden Leaf Village together and simply fight!
 At that timeΓÇª
 Be quiet about this bruise!
 Should I have stopped him forcefullyΓÇª?
 No visitorsΓÇª?
 ThatΓÇÖs correct. IΓÇÖm sorry butΓÇª
 I know heΓÇÖs been hospitalized, but no visitorsΓÇª?!
 WhatΓÇÖs going on?
 WeΓÇÖre also not aware of the details soΓÇª
 ThereΓÇÖs no use worrying about it here.
 Huh?
 Should I bring get-well flowers?
 So pretty.
 Oh no!
 OhΓÇª How unusual for you to come by to buy our flowers.
 N-Not really! Why would you care?
 Besides, isnΓÇÖt it unusual that youΓÇÖre minding the shop?
 IΓÇÖll choose quickly.
 People donΓÇÖt like flowers with roots when theyΓÇÖre in the hospital
 since they donΓÇÖt want to be ΓÇ£rootedΓÇ¥ in the hospitalΓÇª
 So cut flowers are fundamental.
 W-What are you talking aboutΓÇª?
 Playing dumb wonΓÇÖt work.
 YouΓÇÖre going to see Sasuke, right?

 I-Ino?!

 DonΓÇÖt be ridiculous!
 There are numerous people who want to participate, but canΓÇÖt!

 From what IΓÇÖve heard,
 theyΓÇÖre doing some awfully difficult things
 over at Guy and KurenaiΓÇÖs team!

 to get totally thrashed wouldnΓÇÖt be very coolΓÇª

 Oh, IΓÇÖm tiredΓÇª
 Oh, what a waste!
 Why?! He had a chance to become a Chunin!

 But his intelligence and strategies are no longer at the Genin level.

 the win was decided when he captured TemariΓÇª
 So, I suppose he won the competition, but he lost the matchΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs unfortunate he shows no signs of being motivated,

 And thatΓÇÖs exactly whyΓÇª
 heΓÇÖd be able to calmly pull back if he viewed a situation as totally hopeless.
 That could be attributed to calm judgment.
 Shikamaru probably possessesΓÇª
 the most important psychological element required for a ChuninΓÇª
 the disposition of a leader!
 In order to evaluate someone as a leader of a platoonΓÇª
 itΓÇÖs much more important to protect the platoon from danger,
 than to carry out a mission.
 YeahΓÇªitΓÇÖd hardly be worth mentioning a completed mission
 if everyone was annihilated.
 The risks and the mission should be put on a scale,
 surviving should be thought of first, and then action should be taken.
 A person who canΓÇÖt do this isnΓÇÖt qualified to become a Chunin.
 Hyuga and Naruto from earlier fail on that point.
 Although they are all right as insignificant Genin.
 Well, I do feel like Shikamaru gave up too soon too.
 What do you think?
 What do I feelΓÇª?
 He has more of a chance than Naruto, for sure!
 ShootΓÇª!
 Why the heck did he give up!
 Is he an idiot?!
 This ticks me off!
 IΓÇÖm gonna really give him a lecture!
 So the one thatΓÇÖs gonna become a Chunin isΓÇª
 You idiot!
 Shut up, super idiot!
 Why the heck did you give up?!
 LetΓÇÖs not talk about that anymore, all right?
 ItΓÇÖs not all right! It was a match you were close to winning!
 ΓÇô Let's just watch the next match. ΓÇô But you just gave up! Unimaginable!
 Simply unimaginable!
 Huh? The next match?
 SasukeΓÇª!
 ""Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand""
 At last, UchihaΓÇÖs match is next.
 Oh, but whoΓÇÖs this opponent Gaara?
 I wonderΓÇª
 But compared to Uchiha, heΓÇÖs nothing much.
 Do you know?
 I hear UchihaΓÇÖs gonna withdraw from this match.
 Really?!
 Yeah, he apparently sustained a serious injury while training before the matchΓÇª
 Are you serious?
 And to think I took time off specifically to see this match!
 IΓÇÖm counting on you, come on!
 As youΓÇÖd expect, this match will be won by Uchiha.
 No way, IΓÇÖve got high hope for the new one of the Sand.
 He wonΓÇÖt let this one slip by.
 As they say about the world of competitionΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs impossible to predict what will occurΓÇª
 Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,
 he has not yet arrived at the arena.
 UmmΓÇªitΓÇÖs unavoidableΓÇª
 We canΓÇÖt make the guests wait any longer.
 Another ten minutes.
 Why donΓÇÖt we wait just another ten minutes?
 ButΓÇª
 The guests are looking forward to the next match above all else.
 Cancelling it would be cruel.
 Since itΓÇÖs come to this, waiting another ten minutes wouldnΓÇÖt hurt.
 Lord HokageΓÇª?
 UmmΓÇª
 Uchiha, where are you!
 What's keeping you? Hurry up!
 There is some truth to what Kazekage says.
 So shall we extend it for ten minutes from now.
 SoΓÇªlet Genma know of this.
 Yes!
 If it stays like this, Uchiha will really be forced to withdraw.
 I seeΓÇªa ten-minute extensionΓÇª
 SasukeΓÇª
 Hey, isnΓÇÖt thatΓÇª
 Y-You areΓÇª
 But, whatΓÇÖs that idiot doing! HeΓÇÖs still not here?!
 SasukeΓÇª!
 Please!
 Good of the two of you to make it!
 Come now, hurry into the arena!
 Yeah!
 All right! Here we go!
 Oh! Yeah!
 Most of the first round is finished,
 and the only one left is Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara.
 H-How about Naruto and NejiΓÇÖs matchΓÇª?!
 Well, the interesting thing isΓÇª
 That Hyuga lostΓÇª
 Naruto beat NejiΓÇª
 I seeΓÇª
 You did it!
 Naruto!
 YouΓÇÖre such aΓÇª good guy reallyΓÇª
 ΓÇô WhatΓÇÖs going on with the next match! ΓÇô Let's get on with it!
 IsnΓÇÖt Uchiha up yet?!
 We want Uchiha! Uchiha!
 Uchiha!
 Hey, itΓÇÖs almost time.
 Is he really gonna come?!
 HeΓÇÖll comeΓÇª
 HeΓÇÖll definitely come!
 Oh Sasuke, whatΓÇÖs he doing!
 What the heck is Uchiha doing?!
 It seems the rumor that heΓÇÖd had a serious injury was true.
 If thereΓÇÖs a win by default, then this match is mine.
 Thirty more secondsΓÇª
 Uchiha!
 Uchiha!
 SasukeΓÇªplease come!
 Sasuke!
 Hurry up and come!
 It wonΓÇÖt be good if it stays this way!
 The time limit is up.
 So this is it.
 Because the time limit has expired, the last matchΓÇª
 SeeΓÇª Here he isΓÇª
 Well, IΓÇÖm sorry weΓÇÖre lateΓÇª
 SasuΓÇª
 Your name?
 SasukeΓÇªUchiha.
 SasukeΓÇªUchiha.
 Sasuke!
 It looks like he made it in time.
 Lee!
 DarnΓÇª Causing others this much troubleΓÇª
 and thinking himself so important!
 Huh! YouΓÇÖre pretty late!
 I thought you werenΓÇÖt coming ΓÇÿcause you were scared to take me on!
 Who the heck was it that said heΓÇÖd come for sure?
 The first roundΓÇªdid you win?
 Of course!
 DonΓÇÖt get too carried awayΓÇª
 Loser!
 Well, I know itΓÇÖs somewhat rude to be showing up all flashy like thisΓÇª
 but was SasukeΓÇª
 disqualified?
 So your habit of tardiness rubbed off on him? CripesΓÇª
 AndΓÇªwhat about it?
 ItΓÇÖs all right, SasukeΓÇÖs match has been postponed anyway.
 Your arrival was barely in time, butΓÇª
 he hasnΓÇÖt been disqualified.
 ThatΓÇÖs good to hear!
 DonΓÇÖt lose to a guy like that!
 YeahΓÇª
 I want to fight you tooΓÇª
 Sasuke!
 I wantΓÇªto fight you too!
 YeahΓÇª
 Yay, Sasuke!
 Uchiha's match is gonna start!
 Shikamaru gave it so much, but already itΓÇÖs SasukeΓÇª
 Poor ShikamaruΓÇª
 Hey, is that Uchiha?
 IΓÇÿm just second fiddleΓÇª
 Well, I guess thatΓÇÖs just the way it goesΓÇª
 IΓÇÖm looking forward to it too.
 Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.
 What is?
 Well, Naruto did beat that Neji Hyuga andΓÇª
 Sasuke is an elite member of the UchihaΓÇª
 and it seems like everyoneΓÇÖs anxious to see SasukeΓÇÖs match.
 Sasuke will face that Gaara of the Sand whom I couldnΓÇÖt beatΓÇª
 And Naruto beat that Neji that I had hoped to take down.
 Why is it soΓÇª
 Why am I soΓÇª
 frustrated!
 LeeΓÇª!
 At lastΓÇª
 Gaara, come down here!
 Naruto! LetΓÇÖs go up!
 Yeah!
 When we go up, weΓÇÖll leisurely take the stairs.
 WhatΓÇÖs up with you!
 Are you still upset that I pushed you down?!
 T-This isnΓÇÖt goodΓÇª
 ItΓÇÖs been quite awhile since IΓÇÖve seen Gaara like this.
 H-HeyΓÇªGaara.
 Keep the strategy in mind--!
 DonΓÇÖt talk to Gaara right now!
 YouΓÇÖll be killed.
 Right!
 LetΓÇÖs go!
 Hey, hurry up!
 Nothing goodΓÇÖs gonna happen in your life if you panic.
 WhatΓÇÖs wrong?
 Huh?
 Low-level tournaments like this Chunin Examination are ideal
 as gambling matches.
 A number of feudal lords are here for that purpose.
 SoΓÇªwould you lose this match for us.
 Hey, come on, at least give us an answer.
 Too scared to say anythingΓÇª
 H-Help!
 S-Stop! Stop!
 If those two in front of us hadnΓÇÖt been there,
 we probably wouldΓÇÖve been killedΓÇª
 This is the first IΓÇÖve seen anyone kill people without hesitation like thatΓÇª
 This isnΓÇÖt looking good even for Sasuke.
 SasukeΓÇª
 So nowΓÇªat lastΓÇª
 Everyone makes mistakes lt's nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught
 LetΓÇÖs go carve the badges                                 in our chest
 Yes, itΓÇÖs Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  ItΓÇÖs nothing to be ashamed about
 DonΓÇÖt let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Darn it! What kind of guy is that?!
 Gaara is totally not normal! He doesn't even look at us.
 If anyone fights with him like thatΓÇª
 Darn! Hey Shikamaru! We've got to go see Kakashi Sensei!
 We've got to stop this fight, no matter what!
 Next time, ""Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!""
 If nothing's done, Sasuke's a goner!
